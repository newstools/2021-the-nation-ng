The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has delisted 25 Computer-Based Testing (CBT) Centres that failed to conduct examinations on Saturday – the first day of the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Six of those centres were canceled in Lagos – the highest in the country. A statement by JAMB’s head of media, Dr. Fabian Benjamin directed the candidates scheduled to write their examination in the affected centres to check for new instructions on their new centres and dates on their profile, phones or emails. The statement reads: “The following centres who failed during the conduct of the 2021 UTME on Saturday, June 19, 2021, are hereby delisted. Candidates posted to any of these centres are required to await further directives by checking their profile, email addresses and SMS on their registered phone for a new date.”
