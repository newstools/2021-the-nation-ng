CAF President Dr Patrice Motsepe has yet reiterated  the commitment of the continental soccer ruling body-led executive at ensuring  that African soccer becomes more ‘globally competitive and self-supporting.’ The South African billionaire who took over the reins of African football  in March said efforts are being made to improve the game across board, adding his diplomatic shuttles to  some African Heads of State  as well as government ministers and stakeholders in football would buoy the game in the long run. In a CAF statement released yesterday, Motsepe further declared that ‘developing and promoting football at schools and investing in the youth is imperative for the future of African football.’ He sighted the successful launch of the pilot project of the CAF Pan-African Schools Football Championship by CAF in conjunction with FIFA in Kinshasa which was attended by DR Congo’s President Félix Tshisekedi. It would be recalled that the Motsepe Foundation has already donated the sum of $10 million to the CAF Pan-African Schools Football Championship, even as Motsepe affirmed that the fund  will be used as prize money for the winners of the six  CAF Zonal Schools Football Competition and the ultimate champion of the CAF Pan-African Schools Football Championship. He further stressed  the  efforts are being  geared towards  investment  in African football infrastructure and ensuring that in every CAF Member Association there is a FIFA approved stadium as well as the development  and growth of  women’s football and protect the integrity and professionalising refereeing. The statement added that CAF was toying with the idea of broadening its competitions with a CAF African Super League already in view in order to ‘generate additional funding or income for CAF, its Member Associations and bodies and also contribute to African football becoming globally competitive and self-sustaining.’
