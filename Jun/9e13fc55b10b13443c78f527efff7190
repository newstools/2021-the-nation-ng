The 2019 convocation of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), which was suspended in March 2020 due to the crisis between the Wale Babalakin-led Governing Council and Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe-led management has been scheduled to hold July 5-8, 2021. According to the schedule released by the university, the exercise will formally commence with an exhibition and convocation lecture on July 5. The lecture to be chaired by the serving overseer of Citadel Global Community Church (CCGC), Pastor Tunde Bakare, will be delivered by Central Bank Governor, Mr. Godwin Emiefele. Convocation for the awards of degrees and certificates will follow for the Faculties of social sciences, education, arts, environmental sciences and science on July 6 and on July 7 for the Faculties of engineering, Management sciences, arts, law, the school of postgraduate studies and the schools under the college of medicine. Conferment of honorary degrees and awards of PhDs will hold on July 8, 2021, the last day of the convocation. The Vice-Chancellor would announce the names of honorary degrees recipients during the pre-convocation press conference scheduled for June 30, 2021. The convocation was cancelled last year because of disagreement between the management and council over the selection of a convocation lecturer, among others.
