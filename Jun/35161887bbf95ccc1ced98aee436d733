In its drive to grow judo in the state, the Lagos State Judo Association (LSJA) is seeking the support of the Japanese government in terms of technical and material support. Judo is a modern Japanese martial art, which has since evolved into an Olympic event was created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano as a physical, mental, and moral pedagogy in Japan and the LSJA chaired by Sheriff Hammed believes partnering with those that own the sport would help to galvanise the needed technical support to grow judo in Lagos. Speaking after leading LSJA on a courtesy visit to the Japanese Embassy in Abuja, Hammed said the team was excited with the reception by the Japanese team led by its Secretary Nakayoshi Nami. “We went to the owner of the sport with the sole aim of getting their needed support both technically and materially. Again, we used the visit to foster Lagos and the Japanese government relationship. We were well received while the mission promised to support LSJA having followed all our programmes in the last three months. We hope and believe this visit would surely change the fortune of judo in Lagos and Nigeria in general,” Hammed said.   In her remarks, Nami commended LSJA for its efforts in the last three months, while acknowledging that the mission has been following the efforts being made by the association with the staging of several impactful programmes that can grow judo in Nigeria. She however promised that the Mission is ready to assist LSJA while charging the association to continue to work hard to unearth talents as Nigeria is blessed with talents in all sports especially judo. There are assurances from the Japanese government to assist LSJA in their forthcoming seminar cum clinic for physical education teachers in schools.
