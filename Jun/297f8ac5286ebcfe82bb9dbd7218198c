A suspected killer of the 29-year-old lady whose vital organs were cut off in Mosagar, Ethiope West council area of Delta state, has been reportedly arrested by the police. The suspect is under the custody of the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID). Acting Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed to The Nation a suspect had been caught. The Nation had reported the victim was found dead in her apartment in the community on Tuesday. Late Blessing was reportedly last seen on Saturday May 29, after returning home with a man. According to a source, concerns over the whereabouts of the deceased prompted neighbours to invite the police to break down her door, only to find her lifeless body with private parts missing. Neighbours had reportedly perceived a foul smell oozing from her house, before the police were invited over. The Police had confirmed her “private part and nipples were cut off,” when she was discovered.
