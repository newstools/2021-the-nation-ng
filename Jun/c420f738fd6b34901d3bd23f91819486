Nollywood actor Yul Edochie has opened up on his childhood experiences as he penned a heartwarming tribute for his father and veteran actor Pete Edochie. In a post shared via his social media page, Yul Edochie revealed his father was a civil servant before he ventured into the movie industry and had only four pairs of trousers with each colour specified. According to the 39-year-old actor, his father hardly bought things for himself but was very keen about taking care of his family and children to become the best. Yul said his parents were not financially buoyant but taught them to be contented with whatever they have, work hard, believe in God and be upright citizens. While appreciating his father for the good virtues and values instilled in them, Yul, the last of six children, added that his father is very passionate about giving his children the best training and education to survive anywhere. Sharing a photo of his father, the iconic Pete Edochie, Yul captioned post; “At a time, while raising us his six children, this great man had only 4 pairs of trousers. “Black, brown, blue and grey. But he never cared.
He hardly bought new things for himself.
All he cared about was taking care of his family and giving his children the best.
Then he was a civil servant, before the movies came.
There wasn’t much money but he would never take anything that doesn’t belong to him.
Then if we come back from school with anyone’s pen or book, your nyash go catch fire for him hand.
Amongst many other things, my parents taught us to be content with whatever we have, work hard, believe in God and be upright citizens.
All he kept on saying was this ‘if I give my children the best training and the best education they will survive anywhere and they’ll never lack and I will be a fulfilled father’.
Now that I’m older, with each passing day I appreciate you and mum so much more.
Thank you.
Thank you Dad.
Thank you Chief Pete Edochie @peteedochie
Thank You.”
