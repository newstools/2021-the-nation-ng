Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, has stated that the people’s democracy has come to stay on June 12, which he says is at work in the state. He made the declaration yesterday in Benin in his goodwill message to mark this year’s  Democracy Day, while calling on all residents of the state to develop attitudinal change in their approach to governance. Shaibu, a former member of the House of Representatives, said: “Edo State has every reason to celebrate this year’s Democracy Day, because we are the model state of true democracy in Nigeria. The reality of democracy was demonstrated during the September 19, 2020 governorship election, as only the voice of the people prevailed. “The May 28, 2021 landmark judgment of the Supreme Court on Edo governorship election shows that democracy has been given its pride of place in Nigeria. “Government must no longer be viewed as a reservoir for money. We must decolonise our minds from the wrong perception of government and demolish the miserable mindset which sees it as an administrative structure that enhances corruption through illegal draining of government’s resources. “We must begin to appreciate government as a system set up in order to raise edifices for economic and social stability, where there will be no beggars among us and there will be availability of food for those who are hungry.”
