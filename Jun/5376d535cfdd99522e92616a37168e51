Nigeria’s women handball team will today take on hosts Cameroon in the battle for one of the slots in the World Championships as both teams clash in the quarter-final of the ongoing African Women’s Handball Championship. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a win against Cameroon will not only ensure Nigeria’s qualification for the championship’s semi-finals but the World Championships billed for Spain. Nigeria last qualified for a spot in the top four at the 1992 edition of the championship, held in Morocco. To qualify for the quarter-finals, as one of the two best-losers, the Nigerian team defeated Kenya 26-21 in their last group match, after earlier losses to DR Congo and Cameroon. Nigeria’s qualification, however, was on the basis of the two games played and not the win over Kenya, as Guinea’s win over Madagascar on game day three did not count. Guinea and Nigeria were ranked on the strength of the games they played against the top two qualifying teams in their groups.
