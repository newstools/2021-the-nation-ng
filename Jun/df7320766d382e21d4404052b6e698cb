Ebonyi Governor David Umahi has vowed his administration would not allow any form of violent agitation in any part of the State. He stated this at an enlarged Security Council meeting at the Christian Ecumenical Centre, Abakaliki, the state capital on Thursday. According to him, any agitation by any group of persons or region must follow due process. He called on residents to protect themselves by forming vigilante groups across the nooks and crannies of the State. He warned the administration would not fold its hands and allow criminal elements and herdsmen overrun the state. According to him: “As a state, we have vowed not to allow any form of violent agitation; any agitation must follow due process; we prefer one Nigeria and not secession. “Any alleged injustice must be complied and given to leaders of the zone who will in turn send same to the National. “We have been hearing of rumour of herdsmen planning to attack the State. We’ll confront anybody or herder or criminals with AK 47; protect yourself in all nooks and crannies of the State. “Form your vigilante; if they write you that they are coming, tell them to come. We are not afraid. “We have resolved to employ 5,000 Civil servants between now and December and empower 3,000 Ebonyi people. This meeting will be holding once every month. We will do everything possible to protect our people.”
