Police in Lagos have arrested an inmate who escaped from the Owerri correctional facility during a jailbreak in April. Onyemachi Maduabuchi, 34, was taken into custody for allegedly stealing Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card. The suspect was alleged to have stolen the SIM and a memory card belonging to a member of a church his elder sister took him to for deliverance on April 20, a day after he arrived in Lagos. It was learnt that the suspect, who was in prison for 12 years awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy, armed robbery and arson, was on the verge of regaining his freedom through an out of court settlement process being pursued by his family before he escaped from the facility on the night of jailbreak. As soon as he left the prison facility, he was said to have gone to his hometown, Onitsha in Anambra Statem, to see his mother, who then linked him up with his elder sister, Amarachi in Ijegun, Lagos. Maduabuchi is said to have confessed to the offence.
