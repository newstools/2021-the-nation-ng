Celebrity stylist designer Toyin Lawani has said she’s being mocked by people for having kids for different fathers. The mother of two, who recently got married to her second husband, said the insults don’t get to her so far she keeps having wonderful kids. Lawani, who is the CEO of Tiannah’s Empire, made this statement on her Instagram page on Thursday. “I think I’m the most mocked parent out there, Guess what my crime is? Having kids from separate dads”. She continued: “Well if doing that will keep giving me kids like Tiannah and Lord Maine, I will make the mistake over and over and over again because I don’t believe cause you failed once or twice you shouldn’t have the right to love again. “See when it comes to all these nasty shits you people think you write to mock me, it doesn’t move me at all, I’ve grown a tough skin, that’s what you people have taught me to do so I do me and what makes me happy no matter how much you soil my name, the world people who mean well see how hardworking I am at my various crafts and see how I strive at my various crafts daily. “Imagine if I listen to such nonsense y’all have to say, will my kids be where they are today? Will they be making you happy? Cut that crap, see if I like I will have 6 kids from different dads for different reasons, so far it makes me happy, if the next one messes up I will move on again, it’s like you people don’t know me, moni shoko gan. “I don’t let anyone or anything hold me down and I don’t care what anyone has to say when something doesn’t make me happy again I move on. “I’m not one of those that die in silence to please you lots, you lots that don’t even have your life together, are the ones who know how others should be living their lives.” Lawani also hinted at her upcoming reality TV show, which she promised would be huge.
