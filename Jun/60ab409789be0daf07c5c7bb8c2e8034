Premier League new boys Watford have demonstrated huge confidence in Emmanuel Dennis despite the many controversies surrounding him by giving him a five-year contract. The 23-year-old winger, who Watford described as “exciting, young forward”, has signed a contract with Watford till June 2026 after Belgian champions, Club Brugge made it very clear he does not have a future with them. Club Brugge will also receive between four and five Million Euros as transfer fee on the player. Dennis spent part of the 2020-21 season on loan at Bundesliga side Cologne. He scored 27 goals in more than 90 club appearances for Club Bruges, having joined them in 2017, and played in both the Champions League and Europa League. On the flip side, Dennis was accused of being a bad influence in the Club Brugge dressing room. He was also handed a ban for dangerous driving and he was involved in a row over seating arrangement in Club Brugge team bus ahead of a UEFA Champions League tie.
