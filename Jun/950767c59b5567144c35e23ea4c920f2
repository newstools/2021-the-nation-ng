A faction of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) led by Jude Okeke has said that it has suspended a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof Charles Soludo. The faction’s Acting National Publicity Secretary, Ikechukwu Chukwunyere, at a media conference in Abuja on Wednesday, said Soludo was suspended for alleged “anti party activities”. The faction further said that Soludo, who is a frontline aspirant in the upcoming November 6 governorship election in Anambra state on the platform of APGA, also alleged that the former CBN governors has been found to be working against the unity of the party. According to Chukwunyere, the decision to suspend Soludo was taken at a meeting of the faction’s National Working Committee (NWC) held on Tuesday night. Chukwunyere further stated that the faction held a successful Special Delegate Ward Congresses where there members were elected Ward delegates for the faction’s governorship primaries, billed to hold on July 1, 2021. The factional spokesman added that Soludo’s purported suspension was in line with the provisions of the party’s constitution, guidelines set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Electoral Act. Chukwinyere said: “The party is ready for the July 1 primary election and the winner will lead APGA to victory at the November 6, 2021 governorship election.” The faction had described the primaries held in Awka, the Anambra state capital last week where Soludo emerged the winner of the party’s ticket as “a sham and effort in futility.” It added that the outcome of the primaries which produced Soludo as the party’s flag bearer was already being challenged in court, adding that, “in due course, the court will declare it invalid, unconstitutional, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.”
