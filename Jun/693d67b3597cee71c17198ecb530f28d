Suspected herdsmen have allegedly attacked Aguamade village in Eha-Amufu town, in Isi-Uzo council area of Enugu State. The assailants were said to have kidnapped seven villagers, including a woman. They were reported to have killed one of the victims, said to be a well-known commercial motorcyclist and demanded a ransom of N10 million for the release of the remaining six victims. The incident came barely two weeks after another community, Mgbuji in the same Eha-Amufu was attacked and four natives killed by the same suspected herders. Village sources told newsmen Monday that the latest onslaught on the town happened around 7 pm on Wednesday at Pipeline along Eha-Amufu â€“ Ikem road. The sources gave the name of the one killed as Odo Francis Ugochukwu said to be a commercial motorcycle (okada) operator and those abducted as Mercy Olinye, Joseph Ede, Joachin Odo, Odanxu Ala, Chidubem Nwokocha, and Chukwuma Odo. A source who preferred anonymity told our correspondent that one of the natives that escaped disclosed that Francis was killed because he recognised the attackers. The source said the deceased recognized the assailants as some of the people he had carried in his okada as passengers before. Meanwhile, the source said that out of the N10 million being demanded by the abductors, the community had only been able to raise N230,000 which they paid to the kidnappers on Friday. It was not clear if the remaining victims had been freed or still in captivity. When contacted by the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Daniel Ndukwe said he has not been briefed but would get back to the newsmen. He is yet to do so as of the time of filing this report.
