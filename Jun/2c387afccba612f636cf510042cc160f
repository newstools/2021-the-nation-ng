Rivers United coach Stanley Eguma has been kidnapped by gunmen in Enugu on his way from Gombe State where his team lost to Adamawa United on Sunday. A source close to the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) team confirmed the development to Sportingife.ng on Wednesday. According to the source, Eguma was abducted on Monday on his way from Gombe state where his team lost to Adamawa United. “Since the players and other staff members left Enugu yesterday, we didn’t hear from them. Then the management got the news that Eguma had been kidnapped,” the source noted. “The players and staff members slept in Enugu and he didn’t show up the following morning. They thought he slept in Makurdi. “The kidnappers are now negotiating with the club management.” www.sportinglife.ng
