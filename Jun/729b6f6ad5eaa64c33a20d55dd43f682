 Leading music producer and artist Kiddominant has hinted that working with foreign artists influenced his latest body of work ’Too Late Too Lit.’ Kiddominant exclusively told The Nation why it took him so long to release his first body of work saying, “I wanted the process to happen very organically and I wanted the timing to be perfect. After I saw how much the fans loved ‘Fela in Versace’ and ‘e-wallet, it just felt right to drop a body of work.” Kiddominant recently released an eight-track Extended Play(EP). KDDO, as the music producer wants to be known, produced Davido’s smash hit single ‘Fall’ and also co-wrote and produced Chris Brown’s ‘Under the influence.’ He further said, “Yes I think working with foreign artists will influence my EP. Being in the American market kinda introduces my music to a huge new global audience that is just discovering Afrobeats”. Speaking on his journey as a singer, KDDO who made his first transitioning journey as a singer on his hit song with AKA said “Fela in Versace was the first official song I sang on the mic, Shout out to AKA! Most records I mainly produce, but this happened very organically. I just felt it was time and figured why not I’ll try out this hook and it went wild.”
