WILFRED Ndidi rise in value has put him as Africa’s third most valuable player, tying Achraf Hakimi and only behind Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. According to Transfermarkt, the Nigerian international’s value has increased from €50 million to €60 million, which is a 20% increase. Ndidi’s new market value puts him in the joint-third position along with Hakimi on the African continent. The Inter Milan and Morocco star is also valued at €60 million. It’s a remarkable rise for the 24-year old, who joined Leicester City from Belgian side Genk in January 2017 for just €17.6 million. Ndidi has gone on to become a vital player in Leicester’s team. He has a contract until 2024, but the Foxes know he could be set for a big-money move anytime and have already lined up a potential replacement. Meanwhile, he is not the only Nigerian in Africa’s top ten most valuable players. Napoli’s Victor Osimhen also features on the list, although his value is below what the Neoplitans paid to sign him from Lille. The 22-year-old is sixth on the list with a valuation of €50 million. Osimhen joined Napoli from Lille for a club and African record of €81.3 million. Mohamed Salah leads the way with a value of €100 million followed by his club teammate Sadio Mane, who has a market value of €85 million.
