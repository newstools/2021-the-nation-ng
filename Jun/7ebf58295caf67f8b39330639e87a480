Former Nigeria internationals including Daniel Amokachi, Ibrahim Babangida and Emmanuel Babayaro have thrown their weight  behind the African Children Talent Discovery Foundation’s (ACTDF) talent hunt and mentoring programme to be held in in Bauchi between  June 26th  and 27th. Tagged Engr. Noah Dallaji Legacy Project, the talent hunt covers football, music, entertainment and the arts in general. However, this second edition  of the project would feature football where young talents between ages 16 and 18 would be discovered and mentored by big names who are legends in Nigeria’s soccer history. Chairman of the foundation, Engr. Noah Dallaji, said the programme was in furtherance of ACTDF’s vision and mission to discover and develop Nigerian talents to solve some of the challenges of insecurity, social ills and consequently development of the country. He harped on the need to develop the youths by enabling them to discover their talents and thus become useful to themselves, their families and the nation at large. He stated: “This is what we have been doing to see how we can fill the gap of opportunities for the young ones in the country to make impact and be useful to themselves, their communities and the society at large,” Dallaji declared at a press conference in Abuja at the weekend. Dallaji said the Legacy project will continue to progress as an annual event, noting that this year’s edition was initially planned to incorporate such soccer greats like Ronaldo de Lima, David Beckham and Jose Mourinho but was affected by the Covid-19 restrictions while assuring that the next edition would be bigger in size including caliber of soccer legends who will participate. He assured that arrangements were being made to ensure a water tight security for a hitch-free event.
