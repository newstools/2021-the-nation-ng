Daniel Akpeyi has fought back to top reckoning after he pulled off several top-class saves to ensure South African club Kaizer Chiefs will now do battle against Al Ahly of Egypt in the CAF Champions League Final next month. On Saturday, Kaizer Chiefs kept out Wydad Casablanca to a barren draw at home thanks in most part to their Nigeria goalkeeper to go through to the Final 1-0 on aggregate having won the first leg 1-0 in Morocco. Akpeyi has now gone 446 minutes without conceding a goal in the Champions League. He made seven saves with rampant Wydad recording 18 attempts at goal. This is a huge comeback for the former Warri Wolves shot-stopper after he was out of the Kaizer Chiefs team for seven games before he was recalled for this crucial semi-final return leg clash. He also had to play under added pressure after rival Bruce Bvuma had posted a Man-of-the-Match performance in the first game in Morocco.
