Nigeria’s women 4X400m team improved their rating in the world after posting a time of 3:26.84secs to win the event at the Lagos Open Athletics Championship in Lagos and secured a place at Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. Prior to the race yesterday at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, the quartet of Patience Okon-George, Favour Ofili, Imaobong Nse Uko, and Knowledge Omovoh was rated 18th in the world but with the performance yesterday, they had displaced Belarus from the 13th spot to be among the 16 listed teams that will compete at Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The team anchored by experienced Okon-George jumped to the front for the four available slots on offer in Tokyo in a race that featured the fastest U-18 in the world this year, Nse Uko, NCAA 200m finalist Ofili, and Omovoh. With this development, the team is now rated 13th behind France in the world ranking for the best 16 nations that will be in Tokyo ahead of Belarus (3:28.14), Australia (3:28.64), and Switzerland (3:28.77) who have all provisionally qualified. The 4x400m team has now  become the second Nigerian relay team to qualify after the women’s 4x100m team led by Blessing Okagbare sealed their passage to the games with a 42.97secs run at the National Championship (Olympic Trials) last Thursday at the sports ground of Yaba College of Technology, (YABATECH). It was 25 years ago that Nigeria won a silver medal at Atlanta 1996 Olympics where the quartet of Falilat Ogunkoya, Charity Opara, Bisi Afolabi and Fatimah Yusuf set a new 3:21.04secs African record. Unlike their female counterpart, the men’s 4x100m team, however, failed to make it despite improving to 38.59 secs. Also, the men’s 4x400m team also failed to qualify but will be making another attempt to qualify alongside the 4x100m and 4x400m mixed relay teams at the MOC Relay on Sunday at YABATECH in their bid to beat the June 29 deadline.
