Former Super Eagles captains, Kanu Nwankwo, Jay Jay Okocha and other African stars are to mentor selected talents at the 2nd edition of the African Children’s Talent Discovery Foundation’s (ACTDF) talent hunt and mentoring programme. The talent hunt is scheduled for Bauchi from June 26 to 27. Tagged Engr. Noah Dallaji Legacy Project, this year’s edition would feature football where talents between ages 16 and 18 years would be discovered and mentored by big names in Africa’s soccer history. The Chairman of the foundation, Engr. Noah Dallaji said yesterday that the programme was designed to advance ACTDF’s vision and mission of discovering and developing talents with the ultimate aim of developing the country. According to him, “it is important to develop the natural talent of youths in order to maximize opportunities for a purposeful life.” “Every man has something in him that can be activated and be useful in life. So you must try and discover why you came into this world and begin to be useful not only to ourselves but for the greater good of society”. Dallaji said the Legacy project will continue to progress as an annual event, while assuring that the next edition would attract soccer legends and participants. Project Coordinator, Emmanuel Babayaro, said the event proper would be preceded by an open selection process where the selected talents would be camped and mentored by the likes of Daniel Amokachi, Okocha, Kanu, Austin Eguavoen, and others including El Hadji Diouf of Senegal and Stephen Appiah of Ghana.
