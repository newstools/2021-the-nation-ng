Argentina ensured their place in the quarter-finals of the Copa America on Monday when they beat Paraguay 1-0 in a game notable for Lionel Messi’s record-equalling 147th appearance for the national side. The victory in Brasilia was Argentina’s second 1-0 win in a row in this tournament and their 16th match without defeat since losing in the Copa America semi-final in 2019. It gives them seven points from three games and leaves them top of Group A, two points ahead of Chile, four ahead of Paraguay and six ahead of Uruguay. Alejandro Gomez took a delightful pass from Angel Di Maria and dinked the ball over the diving keeper. ‘Angel’s pass was great,’ said Gomez. ‘I just had to get my foot under it and put it away.’ Argentina thought they had a second when Junior Alonso deflected a cross into his own net on the stroke of half time but the goal was chalked off by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR).
