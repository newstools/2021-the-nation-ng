Four specialised varsities and an institute are to  kick-off before the end of the year with an N18 billion grant from the Federal Government, Education Minister Mallam Adamu Adamu said yesterday. The minister told reporters in Abuja that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the establishment of the specialised institutions. The Universities of Technology are to be located in Jigawa and Akwa Ibom states and universities of Health, Nutrition and Medical Sciences to be sited at Azare in  Bauchi State and Ila Orangun, Osun State. According to Mallam Adamu, four existing universities of technology in Yola, Akure, Owerri and Niger states are  to be upgraded and a new National Institute of Technology (NIT) will be established in Abuja by next year. The minister, who was represented by Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Sonny Echono, said the choice of locations was done bearing in mind the promise of establishing an apex technology institute in the nation’s capital and one in each geo-political zone of the country. The minister stated that the establishment of the universities of health sciences was conceived due to the huge doctor-patient gap and dearth of medical research as well as production of pharmaceutical products as exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He said: “After a comprehensive review of the policy by key stakeholders in the education sector, it was resolved that the four existing universities of Technology located in Yola (Northeast), Akure (Southwest), Owerri (Southeast) and Minna (Northcentral) be upgraded and equipped while two additional universities of Technology to be located in Jigawa and Akwa Ibom states, would be established for the purpose.”
