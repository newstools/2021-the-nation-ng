Former Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin and erstwhile Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai (retd.) have received their letters of credence. Both men are the Ambassadors-designate of Nigeria to the Republic of Benin and Cameroon. Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama presented the letters of credence to the ambassadors-designate yesterday in Abuja. The minister, during the brief ceremony, congratulated the former service chiefs on their appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari and advised them to deploy their wealth of experience to promote Nigeria’s interest during their tours of duty in their countries of accreditation. The President had nominated the immediate four service chiefs – Olonisakin, Buratai, as well as ex-CNS, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ekwe Ibas and former CAS, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar – on February 4, 2021 and were confirmed by the Senate on February 23, 2021, despite the public outcry against their nomination. Ibas and Abubakar are still awaiting their postings.
