The Baale of Araromi Idowu Community, Ido Local Government Area, Baale Tafa Apapan, and his wife have been released. They were abducted by unknown gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen in the early hours of Tuesday from his home. Unconfirmed sources said they were released after the abductors collected N2 million ransom from the family. Effort to confirm the release from the police proved abortive. However, the release was confirmed by the Chairman, Ido Local Government Area, Mr. Sheriff Adeojo. Adeojo had earlier assured the people of the community that the government would do everything possible to secure the release of their leader unhurt. Addressing youths who staged a protest to express their displeasure on the kidnap of the Baale and his wife, the council boss assured that the government had opened discussions with relevant security agencies in the state.
