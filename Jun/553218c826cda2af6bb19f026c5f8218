Dele Odule and Lateef Adedimeji have aired their views on a new film, ‘The New Patriots,’ where they both played critical roles. Odule who played the role of a notorious godfather – chief Balogun – who used profits from his shady businesses to manipulate elections and also cover up his shady businesses by participating in politics says the film is a reflection of political activities in Nigeria. “The movie shows how godfathers influence elections negatively in Nigeria. The youths became fed up and decided to revolt. It is all about revolution, they believe enough was enough and that people shouldn’t do politics for their gain,” he said. On his part, Lateef Adedimeji, who played the role of the leader of the patriots, said, “I played the role of the leader of the Patriots itself, who was able to get things done the right way without violence. They got the money used wrongly by the government and used it the right way. It is a typical story of what Nigeria is going through right now, what we have gone through in the past, and what we might likely go through if we do not pay attention to some of the solutions proffered in the movie. If we pay attention to it, I think Nigeria should be a better place for us all to live in,” Lateef said. On the movie being selected for several international film festivals, Adedimeji said: “It is the joy of every actor or thespian to participate in a project and it is being recognized. ‘The New Patriots’, is produced by Dr. Rotimi Adelola  and directed by Adebayo Tijani and is slated to be in the cinemas from June 11.
