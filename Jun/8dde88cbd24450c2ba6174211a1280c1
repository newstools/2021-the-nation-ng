Gernot Rohr has declared the Super Eagles will be ready to get off to a good start in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers in September. The Eagles prepared for the World Cup qualifiers with two test matches against Cameroon in Austria, losing one and drawing the other. In September, they first welcome Liberia to Lagos, before they embark on a tricky trip to Cape Verde. “We will be ready in September for the World Cup qualifiers,” Rohr said after yesterday’s goalless draw with Cameroon in Austria. “We hope the fans can return to the stadium in September after this crazy Pandemic (Coronavirus), which has made everything difficult. “We have to start well in Lagos (vs Liberia) and four days later, we play in Cape Verde. “Cape Verde beat Cameroon 3-1 on their synthetic pitch recently. So, we know already that it will be very difficult. “Our first two matches are very, very important.” Rohr also praised Galatasaray defender Valentine Ozornwafor after the scoreless draw with Cameroon. “He did very well,” he commended. “I am very happy for him. “Many people did not understand why he’s with us.”
