Popular gospel singer Tope Alabi is on the hot seat following her criticism of colleague Adeyinka Alaseyori over her popular hit song titled ‘Oniduro Mi eseun o’ (my guarantor, I’m grateful). The song was one of the most played in 2020. In a video making the rounds on social media, Tope Alabi said God isn’t her guarantor because He’s more than a guarantor. According to Tope Alabi, Adeyinka Alaseyori, who seems to be the reigning gospel singer of the moment, stated had the song being led by the Holy Spirit, she would understood God is more than a guarantor and will not say such a word. “If the Holy Spirit brings it, you are supposed, to digest it, chew it and organise it, before bringing it out,” Tope Alabi had stated. But many fans had alleged Tope Alabi’s criticism was based on envy.
