Yoruba Nation Agitator Chief Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho has declared nobody can attack or kill him over the Yoruba Nation rally billed for Lagos on Saturday, July 3, 2021. The Nation had reported Igboho had vowed to proceed with the rally. Igboho, while receiving a vehicle presented to him by some donors to support the Yoruba Nation agitation, stated that nobody can tell him not to come to Lagos adding that the Yoruba Nation rally will go on as planned. He said: “Some people are going about saying we shouldn’t come to Lagos that we’ll be killed, it is a lie and it is all false. Nobody has said he will kill Igboho in Lagos, and nobody has said Igboho should not come to Lagos “I’m a true son of the soil, Lagos is a Yoruba land and does not belong to the Hausas or any other tribe, so let us focus on the current struggle and don’t let us dwell on rumors. “Although in rumours, there are some elements of truth but we are optimistic. Lagos is a Yoruba land and majority of those in Lagos are Yorubas and the way Yorubas are suffering, many are not satisfied. “We are not scared of anybody… We have done peaceful rallies across other southwest states and we are just creating awareness. We are not coming to Lagos to create crises or cause troubles. We are peaceful “Those thinking we won’t hold the rally in Lagos are deceiving themselves; we call on the Lagos state government to provide security operatives to protect the agitators on the said date. “Lagosians are ready to receive us peacefully on July 3, we are coming with a peaceful awareness too.”
