Anthony Joshua will have a rematch clause in place for his upcoming fight against Oleksandr Usyk, confirms his promoter, Eddie Hearn. Joshua’s fight against the dangerous Ukrainian has not been officially announced but a deal is expected shortly, with Hearn still in dialogue with Usyk’s team K2 Promotions, but he revealed that ‘all the terms are agreed’, with just a few small details to be thrashed out. The British world champion was forced to move on from a undisputed mega-fight against Tyson Fury after the ‘Gypsy King’ was ordered to face Deontay Wilder for a third time this summer following an arbitration ruling, and Joshua could see his hopes of an epic match-up go up in smoke should he fall to Usyk. Joshua will need to see off the threat of Usyk, who he is likely to face in September at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, while hoping Fury comes through against Wilder unscathed before he can square off against his British rival. And Hearn played down the significance of having a rematch clause, saying it would benefit Usyk hugely should he win the first fight because he would then be paid a lucrative pay packet for the second fight. When asked by BetFred if there would be a rematch clause in place, Hearn replied: “There will be,” insisting the term was not holding up negotiations. “All the terms are agreed and that was a prior term. When you talk about a rematch clause, it’s also the biggest fight that fighter could have.  Sometimes people think, “that’s a bad thing”. It’s actually sometimes a good thing.
