After several years of being separated from her husband, Lanre Gentry, Nollywood actress- cum- businesswoman, Mercy Aigbe reveals she might be giving marriage another shot. Mercy Aigbe had walked away from her marriage of seven years that produced two children, a daughter and son, over claims of domestic violence. The 43-year-old who seemed to have found love again but has refused to show the face of her mystery lover disclosed her decision in a recent post on her Instagram page. Mercy Aigbe’s new lover had sent her a beautiful bouquet of flowers and special accompanying message to encourage and reaffirm his love for her while on a movie set. The single mother of two, who lately seemed to be getting an overdose of love, affirmed that love is a beautiful thing and might just consider changing her mind and give marriage another shot. The actress shared a photo of herself holding the lovely bouquet of flowers with the caption that reads: “So D Owner’ sent me flowers on set with a note that says “Keep flying high babe, I am rooting for you “ love you forever. It’s the little things! “Agbeke Aya ‘D Owner’ Maybe, just maybe I might change my mind and give marriage another shot! Love sweet sha, Iro o da.”
