A PRINTING expert, Abduraheem Adeoye has urged the government to subsidise the cost of imported printing equipment and consumables. Adeoye, Chief Executive Officer of Dynamic Prints Ltd, said this was a temporary measure, adding that the long term solution to the problem of imported equipment is to develop indigenous technology. Adeoye, in an interview with reporters, tasked the government to “look deeply at technology, because we have loads of talent in this country. “If the government can partner with technologically advanced countries like India, Korea, Germany and China to create a technology hub, you will be amazed at what Nigeria will be producing in terms of equipment.” Adeoye identified erratic power supply as another challenge facing the printing industry. He urged the government to consider generating electricity from animal waste which can be converted to biogas.
