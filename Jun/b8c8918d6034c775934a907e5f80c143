The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) on Wednesday said that the region will not ask for a separate republic to pull out of Nigeria. The Forum urged northerners to unite and fight against activities of kidnappers, bandits and other criminal elements in the region. In their separate remarks at the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the Forum, Chairman Chief Audu Ogbe and Secretary-General Murtala Aliyu noted that insecurity had become unbearable in the North and should be tackled headlong. Ogbe said: “At this time other than before that the North is facing security challenges, we have to come together and solve our problems. Don’t lose faith, we shall overcome the challenges. “What we want is peace and an end to banditry and criminality. All we want is an improvement in the economy of our country for the betterment in the lives of our people generally, especially the North.” Aliyu said: “North will not ask for separation from the country. There are due processes of going about agitation. North will not ask for a separate republic as it is being done in Southeast and the West by IPOB and Sunday Igboho. “We are going to work for a united Nigeria and that is what we stand for. “They have raised the issues of resource control, division of the country and so on. The rapid response committee of ACF is to respond to issues affecting the Arewa.”
