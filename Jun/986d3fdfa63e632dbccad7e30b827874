A member of the House of Representatives representing Abor Mbaise and Ngor Okpala federal constituency of Imo State, Rep. Bede Eke on Thursday accused security agents of embarking on extrajudicial killings of people in the state. Addressing newsmen in Abuja, the lawmaker said the killings are coming on the heels of the recent murder of the former presidential adviser and chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Ahmed Gulak in Owerri, Imo State. He gave the names of some of the victims of extrajudicial killings by security agents in the state as Noel Chigbu Nzeribe and Tochi Ekwe while alleging that several other persons are currently missing. He disclosed that many residents of his Constituency have been driven to the bushes while others fled to where they have spent days without their families. While condemning Gulak’s murder, the lawmaker appealed to the security agencies to exercise restraints and stop killing innocent people, adding that the cries of his constituents have reached a crescendo to intervene in their current ordeal in the hands of the security operatives. The lawmaker said the police and the army should conduct discreet investigations to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice rather than mass intimidation and killings of his constituents. “We lost a young man. Until his death owns and operates a Shawarma shop just to make ends meet. He was hot by the army because he could not obey the rules at the checkpoint. “The family has written a petition to the army. We as the people of Ngor Okpala/Mbaise are not happy about it and as the representative of the people; I want to make it known to the world that we are waiting for the outcome of the petition. “As the representative of the people, I am giving the army 14 to respond to the killing of that young man who left a pregnant wife and his two children. One is 3 and the other is 2 years old.”
