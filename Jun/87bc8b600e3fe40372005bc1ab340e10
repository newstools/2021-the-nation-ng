The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) on Monday took its free healthcare initiative to Damagaza Community in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Residents of the community were offered free drugs, free eye testing, medical glasses and other medical consumables as part of the scheme’s health week. Director-General of the NYSC, Brig-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, said since the introduction of the NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers (NYSC- HIRD), over 300 wheelchairs have been donated to different communities. He also said the scheme has established community-based clinics, set up clinics for NYSC Secretariat, administered first aid and provided humanitarian. Ibrahim, who flagged – off the nationwide health week, admonished people residing in rural areas where the medical outreaches are taking place to present themselves for free medical services. The DG said the health interventions of the scheme have made “enormous impacts such as contribution to the improvement of reproductive health, reduction of maternal and infant mortality as well as maintenance and improvement of health infrastructure.” He added: “However, given our desire to expand the scope of the NYSC- HIRD and make it more impactful, I appeal for the support of corporate bodies and well-to-do individuals towards actualising our plan of setting up Mobile Clinics for wider outreach. “We will also continue to appreciate your usual donation of drugs and other medical consumables.”
