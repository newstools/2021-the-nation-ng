The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate  (PTAD) has issued a Certificate of Non-Indebtedness to AIICO Insurance Plc. The certificate clears the underwriter of any claim of non-remittance of pension assets. This was affirmed at a meeting held to hand over redeemed properties ceded by the company in 2017 in lieu of legacy funds and assets of pensioners to PTAD. This process is subsequent upon confirmation of receipt of the full payment from AIICO and completing all reconciliation. The Executive Secretary, PTAD, Mrs. Chioma Ejikeme, represented by Godwin Iheabunike, said: “In acknowledgement of the payments made by AIICO Insurance Plc, PTAD has issued a Certificate of Non-Indebtedness to AIICO Insurance Plc and will update relevant institutions of this development soon. She added: “We thank AIICO Insurance Plc for her commitment towards the liquidation of this liability within the shortest period of time. My congratulations go to the MD/CEO and his team for this uncommon accomplishment. I call on other insurance underwriters holding on to legacy funds and assets to do the needful as a matter of urgency. This will enable the Directorate to meet its obligation to pensioners.” The Managing Director, AIICO Insurance, Mr Babatunde Fajemirokun, praised the PTAD leadership for working with the AIICO team.
