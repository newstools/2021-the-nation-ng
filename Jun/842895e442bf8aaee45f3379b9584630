A former student of the Faculty of Law, Usmanu Danfodiyo University (UDUS), Rufai Khalid, has donated 200 textbooks to the faculty and final year students. The book entitled: “Company Secretary and Legal Adviser”  was distributed on campus. The Dean of the faculty, Prof. Mufutau Rufai, said 150 copies were  given  to  final year Law students, while 50 would be distributed to the faculty library, school library and college of legal studies library. Rufai said the donor,  who graduated from the faculty in 1990, had served in various capacities at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). He praised him for giving back to his alma mater by donating those text books. After the distribution, the dean  urged the students to emulate the donor. He said: “You are now in your final year, also remember to give back to the faculty when you go to the larger society. There are different alumni of the faculty who had been assisting the faculty in one way or the other. There some who donated money as prizes for the best students upon their graduation and others who donated internet facilities to the faculty. We also have others who promised to give to the faculty. These are the activities of the alumni, in case you want to be part of the sucess story.” Speaking on behalf of the students, Ibrahim Sanyinna, a final year Law student thanked the donor for the gift. He lauded the dean and other faculty staff for their efforts in providing good mentorship for the students. “On behalf of the final year students, we thank   the faculty and the donor who found us worthy of such fantastic gift. We would do same after our graduation and later in life. We thank them immensely and may Allah reward them abundantly,” he said.
