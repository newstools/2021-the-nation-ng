This week, DStv and GOtv customers will get to watch the finale of the UEFA Euro 2020 group stage matches live on SuperSport. In Group D, Croatia is set to face Scotland in Glasgow at 8 pm. The clash between Croatia and Scotland is something of a do or die: a draw between the teams would probably not be enough for either to advance as one of the best third-place teams, meaning both must lay it all on the line for victory. Czech Republic will take on England in London at 8 pm. England are on the same level with the Czechs on four points, with both teams guaranteed a top-three finish and effectively through to the Round of 16. Yet the Three Lions will be looking to make a major statement. Catch the group D matches tonight, live on SS EURO2020 (DStv channel 204 & GOtv channel 32) and on SS Football (DStv channel 205 and GOtv channel 31). In Group E, Slovakia will clash with Spain in Seville at 5 pm. Slovakia coach Stefan Tarkovic has promised a tough game for Enrique’s side. Sweden will take on Poland in Saint Petersburg at 5 pm. All group E matches will air live today on SS Euro 2020. Also, today in group F, Portugal will face France in Budapest. The ‘Group of Death’ has been an unpredictable one thus far. France tops the group and are best placed to guarantee progression, but Portugal will be tough opponents in Budapest as they look to bounce back from their 4-2 humbling at the hands of the Germans. In Munich, Germany will target a win over bottom-of-the-log Hungary to secure a berth in the knockout stages at 8 pm.
