HOME-BASED Super Eagles assistant coach Paul Aigbogun is impressed with the fitness level of the team as the team made up solely of players in Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL), continue preparations ahead of the July 3 friendly against Mexico in Los Angeles in the United States of America (USA). The former Enyimba boss led the Super Eagles to their first training session at the FIFA Goal Project pitch in Abuja and he was particularly impressed with the fitness level of the invited players. “I think one important thing is that they came to come in good shape,” Aigbogun said after the team’s training. “They are trying to express themselves and it is just for them to take on board what the head of the team is trying to impact on them” He added: “So far they are doing well, there are improvements to be made obviously, because it is a new thing for them but what we have seen so far is quite positive at the moment.” Aigbogun, who led the Flying Eagles to the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland, admitted that Mexico will not be an easy team but expressed his confidence that the team can rise to the occasion and make the country proud. “Mexico is not an easy team but I think it is a challenge for them, it is a challenge for everybody here and I think it is for them to go about and feel confident, take the opportunity in front of them and make the nation proud,” he enthused.
