The ongoing constitution amendment should provide for the president and governors to serve only a single term of five years rather than two four-year terms. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should be empowered to conduct local government elections. National appointments must comply with the federal character principle and its violation should be an impeachable offence. These are the views of a former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant in Akwa Ibom State, Robert Ekutmfon Umoette. Speaking with reporters in Lagos, he backed the Asaba Declaration of Southern governors. A five-year term, he said, would “reduce animosity and acrimony and allow for focus towards true service delivery from day one in office”. Immunity clause removal, he believes, will end the “emperor-like tendency and make them (president, governors and their deputies) open to legitimate criminal proceedings for actions carried out while in the office with credible evidence”. Umoette said the cost of governance required drastic reduction to ensure that federal and state budgets are minimum 70 per cent capital and 30 per cent recurrent expenditures (preferably 75-25 per cent). He said this will require the merger of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), reduction of staff strength, and elimination of “abnormal benefits” for public officeholders. He said power should be devolved so that each state will control their resources and internal security and pay a royalty to the centre, which he believes will make states innovative.
