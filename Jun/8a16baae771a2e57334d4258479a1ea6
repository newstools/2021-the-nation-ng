The Lagos State Health Management Agency (LASHMA) said it has partnered Bono Energy Storage Terminal (BEST) to bring on board 300 vulnerable residents its Ilera Eko health plan. Its General Manager, Dr. Emmanuella Zamba, while receiving in her office the Managing Director, BEST, Dr. Kayode Ayodeji, said the state government is serious about lessening the plight of residents who pay expensive medical bills out of pocket. She added that the government’s determination to open access to quality medical care for residents irrespective of class or tribe was what led to the establishment of the Lagos State Health Scheme (LSHS). Commending BEST for its good gesture to offer free access to healthcare for the vulnerable, Zamba said although the government has also set aside one per cent of its consolidated revenue fund equity fund to provide healthcare for the same group, the  fund could not adequately take care of everyone in the socio-economic bracket. “It is a great task for the government to (bring) on board all the vulnerable people and indigent in the state on the health scheme without the support of other influential people and organisations,” she said. The LASHMA GM appealed to the private sector, individuals and philanthropists to come to the aid of the vulnerable and indigent by paying for their health insurance plan, just like BEST had done. Ayodeji praised Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his efforts at ensuring that Lagos residents, especially the vulnerable and indigent, have access to healthcare services. Ayodeji, who said the aim of his organisation is to take care of about 30,000 vulnerable people, promised to support LASHMA and, by extension, the  government at ensuring that the vulnerable in the state live a healthy and productive life. He promised to reach out to the organisation’s sister companies to come on board and provide healthcare access to other vulnerable residents in the state.
