The Director-General of the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), Jelani Aliyu will be a special guest at the forthcoming Nigeria Auto Journalists Association (NAJA) workshop. The event, slated for July 29, 2021 with the theme ‘’Migration from petrol to electric and gas-powered vehicles; opportunities and challenges for Nigeria,’’ will be held at Sheraton Hotels, Ikeja Lagos. NAJA Chairman Mike Ochonma, said was aimed at providing a robust refresher course for auto reporters to enhance their performances in auto journalism, especially in view of the new electric car technology that is gradually being accepted by many countries. “The need for training and retraining cannot be over emphasised, especially in the 21st century which is largely driven by the knowledge economy. “Given the challenges of the times, NAJA’s resolve to continually equip members across the nation with relevant skills, and acquaint them with modern trends, tools and techniques for enhanced and effective performance, is further demonstrated through this upcoming seminar.”
