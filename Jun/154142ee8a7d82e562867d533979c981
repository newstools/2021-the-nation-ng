Giorgio Chiellini says Italy are ready to face Euro 2020 with ‘enthusiasm’ and warns Turkey are ‘capable of really extraordinary performances.’ The tournament kicks off today at 19.45 UK time (18.45 GMT) at the Stadio Olimpico. “We waited a year to play this Euros and can’t wait. The stadium looks ready, we can start feeling a different level of adrenaline today,” Chiellini told Sky Sport Italia. “We have to experience this month with enthusiasm and see what happens. Things are going well, we feel mentally and physically ready, now all we can do is step onto the field and face the difficulties with enthusiasm and confidence.” Lorenzo Pellegrini pulled out this morning with a muscular injury and has been replaced by Fiorentina midfielder Gaetano Castrovilli. “One day from the start of the Euros, it’s really tough to leave. He was very disappointed, so were we, but he’ll remain part of the group anyway, because it’s more than just 26 players here, it’s all those who contributed to us getting here over three years.”   Italy’s opening game is against Turkey, in Group A with Switzerland and Wales. “Turkey is a very strong team, we know several of their players from Serie A, others we’d faced before too. They are a dangerous side who can hurt us, and they pull something out of themselves even stronger than at club level, as they have this wonderful, intensive determination to play for their country. They are capable of really extraordinary performances. “We’ll have the fans in the stadium and it’s a very different atmosphere, we hope they can fire us up to give even more.”
