The Nation has won the Rotary District 9110, Nigeria, award for extensive reporting of humanitarian activities. The award, Best Online Newspaper in Reportage of Rotary Activities in District 9110, was presented to the newspaper on Wednesday at the Rotary Centre in Ikeja GRA, the Lagos State capital. Other media organisations and individuals were also recognised at the award ceremony. The Punch, The Guardian, TVC Communications, Lagos Television, Radio Lagos, Yes Online Magazine, and Lagos State Signage and Advertising Agency Chairman of the Award Planning Committee, Samuel Ayetutu, said winners were nominated by a cross-section of over 100 Rotary Club chapters in Lagos and Ogun states, followed by a painstaking screening. “Our gathering tonight is to recognise and celebrate the key actors in the fourth estate of the realm who have and will continue to play a critical role in the quest of Rotary International to extend its objectives in doing well around the world. “We are celebrating here today media organisations across the print, broadcast and online and other sectors of the media industry for their support for projecting the efforts of Rotarians who seamlessly contribute their time, talent and treasure to address many of the basic challenges facing our people,” Ayetutu said.
