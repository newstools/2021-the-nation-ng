Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, yesterday in Abuja warned that no national sports federation in the country is autonomous of the government. Dare, while inaugurating the new board of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), led by Tonobok Okowa, said no sports federation can unilaterally lay claim to any autonomy. The minister’s position was against the backdrop of the AFN board elections on Monday, with the one in Abuja producing Okowa and the other in Birnin-Kebbi producing Ibrahim Gusau. “For the avoidance of doubt, no sports federation is autonomous of government. If such exists, it’s a misnomer and illegal. None of Nigeria’s 38 federations is autonomous,” he said. Dare, who emphasised that the only AFN board recognised by the Sports Ministry was the one led by Okowa, stating that the country’s laws were clear on this. The minister explained that the ministry’s recognition of Okowa’s board was due to the compliance with the Constitution of the Federation and laws of the land. Dare, while charging the board to reposition the federation in line with international best practices said its emergence was indeed a new dawn for track and field in Nigeria. He assured that the ministry would duly inform World Athletics of the new development, according to articles 7.5 and 9.1 (e) of 2019 World Athletics Constitution. Dare also said the Federal Government was working round the clock to ensure podium finish for Team Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympics. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Okowa had on Monday emerged the new President of AFN in the elections conducted in Abuja, while Gusau was re-elected AFN President in Birnin-Kebbi the same day.
