GERMANY forward Thomas Mueller insists his knee injury will not stop him facing England in Tuesday’s blockbuster Euro 2020 last 16 clash at Wembley. “If it was a problem, I wouldn’t have trained today,” Mueller said Saturday at Germany’s Euro 2020 base camp in Bavaria. “The capsular injury does not hold me back and I am experienced enough to deal with it. I’m convinced it won’t be a problem for Tuesday,” he added. Mueller is expected to start against England having been left out of the line-up for Wednesday’s 2-2 draw with Hungary, in which he came on as a second-half replacement.
