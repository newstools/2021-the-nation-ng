Many suspected members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the militia wing of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) group, were on Friday killed during raids on their camps in Imo State by police operatives. The raid, which took place at Atta, Izombe and Ideato North areas of the state, was said to have commenced around 4 am.  The Nation gathered that operatives of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Special Tactical Squad (STS), Anti-Kidnapping Unit (AKU) and other special forces carried out the operation and completely overran three camps allegedly belonging to IPOB/ESN. Sources told The Nation that a commander of the group who was earlier arrested led the operatives to the camps where several weapons, stolen vehicles, explosives, gun powders, charms, weed, ammunition, hard drugs and the groupâ€™s flags were recovered.  Although the number of suspects killed was not specified, a source privy to the operation said many of them were neutralised inside the forest during gun battles. He said six of the suspects were apprehended and were currently aiding police investigation.
