The Deputy Governor of Imo State, Professor Placid Njoku, is definitely walking on slippery political grounds these days and it appears he knows. For the second time in a matter of weeks, an attempt was made during the week to bring him to public ridicule, or confrontation with his boss, Governor Hope Uzodinma. When the rumour of Njoku’s alleged resignation from the government broke, not a few people were stunned, given what many see as the very cordial relationship between him and the governor. But the news spread really fast like the one before it a week earlier. Tale bearers had before the latest smear attempt on the scholar-turned-politician, gone to town with news of a festering disagreement between Njoku and Uzodinma. They even added that the assembly may soon move against him. The deputy governor has since denied his purported resignation as a tale being peddled by those hell-bent on destabilizing the Imo government. Well, once again, the prof, as he’s fondly called has escaped another smear campaign, but what many are yearning to know is the identity of those trying to ‘bully’ him. One concerned person recently enquired from Sentry: “Are the people after Njoku within or outside the government?” This is one question still searching for an answer.
