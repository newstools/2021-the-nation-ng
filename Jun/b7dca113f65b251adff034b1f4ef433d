Brazil will host Copa America for the second consecutive time after Colombia and Argentina were stripped of hosting rights for the tournament. South American soccer body CONMEBOL announced the decision yesterday after it ruled out Argentina amid an increase in COVID-19 cases in the country. Colombia was removed as co-host on May 20 as street protests against President Iv√°n Duque rocked the nation. CONMEBOL said on Twitter that the tournament is confirmed to take place between June 13 and July 10. Brazil is the defending champion, winning the competition in 2019 as hosts.
