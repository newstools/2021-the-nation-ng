MINISTER of Youth and sports Development Mr Sunday Dare has charged Kamaru Usman to use his clout to develop martial arts   in Nigeria. The Minister made this appeal on Friday when he hosted the UFC champion in his office in Abuja. He said: “Today we just hit another notch of excitement as a Ministry and as a country having Kamaru Usman who is nicknamed “Nightmare” for his opponents in the octagon in the country. Kamaru who has a staggering 19 wins out of 20 fights has established himself as a legend in the Welterweight category. Kamaru embodies two cultures; Nigerian by birth and an American by immigration having moved to the USA at the age of 8 and is returning to the country for the first time as an adult. The Minister said “it is commendable for you to have identified fully with your country and also the Ministry that has the mandate for Sports Development. The Ministry is concerned with the large number of Youth who are engaged in sports and interested in your kind of sports because it has become a rave because it falls under the radar of the mixed Martial Art and we are concerned about growing it. Having you here, as the champion it will be great to have you headline that and start to see how at a National level and as a country we can work together to see your success remain and get other youths interested in this sport.”
