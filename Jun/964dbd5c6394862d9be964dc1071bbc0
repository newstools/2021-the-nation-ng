Leaders of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Somolu had cleared the air on the chairmanship candidate for the forthcoming council election. This was as thousands of APC members in Somolu defied the early morning downpour yesterday to applaud the emergence of Abdul Hamed Salawu as the party’s candidate. Dosu Matiluko, who spoke on behalf of the party leaders, thanked Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) members for leading the party in the right direction. Matiluko hailed Senator Anthony Adefuye’s consistency in ensuring stability among party members in Somolu. “APC in Somolu is a well-coordinated chapter of the party with strong internal mechanism to resolve issues,” he said. According to him, the party had reached a common front to ensure the incumbent council chairman, Salawu re-run and complete his second term in office. “All the leaders of APC in Somolu agreed long before now that Salawu should complete his second term,” Matiluko said.
