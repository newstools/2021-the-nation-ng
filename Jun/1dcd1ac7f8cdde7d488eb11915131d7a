Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare has reassured Olympics-bound athletes – Elizabeth Anyanacho and Olufunke Oshonaike that the country is looking forward to celebrating their podium success after the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The minister gave this reassurance when he hosted Anyanacho and Oshonaike in Abuja yesterday. “The next 29 days we will be racing nonstop. I recall when I visited Elizabeth’s camp in Maitama, Abuja, I saw her and two others who are also African champions training. I saw the commitment, dedication and we made a commitment to support her which we did almost immediately. We got her adopted on the spot after we made a pitch for her, the adopter proceeded and paid the cash that same day.” On Oshonaike who is making a record 7th appearance at the Olympics, the minister said: “This lady has been terrific and through a lot, any other young person would have given up in this country. She struggled through school and she has remained committed and has continued to excel accordingly. We are very proud of you and look forward to a good performance at the Olympics. In an event dominated by Asians, you have proven that you are a special breed.”
