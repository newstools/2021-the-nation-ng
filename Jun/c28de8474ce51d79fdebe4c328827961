Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has said he has no fear over decision of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate, Etitayo Jegede, to head to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal sitting in Akure had partially upheld Jegede’s appeal on the ruling of the lower tribunal. Governor Akeredolu, who was welcomed to Akure by a mammoth crowd who joined him in a celebration, marched through major streets of Akure. Akeredolu said the petition has never distracted his focus on governance in the state. He assured the crowd his administration would continue to deliver dividends of good governance across the three senatorial districts. He expressed confidence that he would win again at the Supreme Court if Jegede and the PDP decided to challenge the ruling of the Appeal Court. The Governor said the petition was an exercise in futility and a flimsy one which could not hold water. According to him: “I am not distracted in any way by the legal challenge. My administration is well-focused and committed to delivering more dividends of good governance to the people of the state. “The will of the people will always triumph. I have not fear.”
