Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has decried the attitude of trading blames and bulk-passing amongst Nigerians on the growing insecurity situation in the country, insisting that security is everyone’s responsibility and must not be surrendered to the manipulations of criminals and street urchins. Masari, who made the declaration at the commissioning of a state-of-the-art, operational security tracking facility and communication center for security operatives located at the Police Headquarters, Katsina, said the import of the center, which was a brainchild of Katsina Initiative, should be extended as an awareness campaign to the rural communities, to ensure they defend themselves against banditry attacks.” He said: “The era of trading accusations is over; we must consider security as our collective responsibility. “Why are we surrendering our responsibility to some people that are mindless, who kill and maim our people? The ideals of Katsina Initiative should be taken to the people to defend themselves.” He wondered how many the bandits really are, stating that, “It’s because we have failed to do what we are supposed to do that we have overstretched the armed forces.” The Governor added that the installation of the Tracking Center will further help in addressing the situation.
