The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) has stopped doctors from appearing before the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) over malpractice allegations. The FCCPC had organised a public hearing to investigate issues involving medical practitioners over “possible violations of patient/consumer rights under the Federal Competitions and Consumer Protection Act 2018, and other laws in providing medical attention/urgent care”. But the MDCN, in a June 14 letter by its Registrar, Dr T.A.B. Sanusi to FCCPC Executive Vice-Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, a copy of which The Nation obtained yesterday, said no doctor would appear before any panel set up by the agency. “As you are aware, the Council is the statutory body with the mandate for the regulation of the professions and practice of medicine and dentistry in Nigeria. We note that the subject of your intended investigation, as stated in your release, relates purely to allegations of misconduct in professional respect by registered medical practitioners while attending to a patient. “An investigation of this nature conducted by your Commission is an encroachment on the statutory mandate of the Council as provided by Section 15(3) of the Medical and Dental Practitioners’ Act, and contrary to Section 18(i) of Federal Competitions and Consumer Protection Act 2018. “We also note that the proposed format of your investigation would put registered medical practitioners in the untenable position to violate the rights of a patient to confidentiality even after their demise, a very serious offence under the Code of Medical Ethics in Nigeria 2008 edition. ‘’Pursuant to the foregoing, the Council has directed all registered medical practitioners and dental surgeons in Nigeria not to participate in your investigation of June 10, 2021, or any other date pending further directives,” Sanusi stated.
