Ronaldo could reunite with former Everton manager Ancelotti at Real Madrid, after the Italian was reappointed as manager of Los Blancos. Ancelotti and Ronaldo worked together at Real Madrid previously and won the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and the Spanish Cup. Last month The Athletic reported that agents associated with Juventus insisted that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner could leave Italy, with figures at United monitoring the situation. The report claimed that United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has remained in touch with his former teammate and he would give the go ahead to a deal involving Ronaldo’s return to the Red Devils – if the finances are reasonable.  If Ronaldo were to make the switch from Turin to Madrid, United would have to look elsewhere for attacking options this summer. Last month Harry Kane reportedly expressed his desire to leave Tottenham in the transfer window and according to Sky Sports, Man United are among a number of Premier League clubs interested in his signature. The England captain won both the Golden Boot and Playmaker of the Season awards for 20/21 with 23 goals and 14 assists respectively. At the age of 27, Kane is in his prime and would offer United more years of service than Ronaldo.
