Cristiano Ronaldo has refused to commit his future to Juventus ahead of Portugal’s start to Euro 2020. Ronaldo, 36, has a year left on his contract with the Italian giants, but that has not stopped intermediaries from assessing whether leading European clubs want to make a move for Portugal captain. Ronaldo is expected to decide his future after the European Championship. Speaking ahead of Portugal’s opener against Hungary in Budapest today, Ronaldo was asked about his club future and he said: “I’ve been playing at a high level for 18 years, it doesn’t even tickle me. If I were starting now, being 18 or 19 maybe, I wouldn’t sleep thinking about my future.   “But as you can calculate by now, at 36-years-old… whatever comes will be for the good, regardless of whether one stays or leaves, that’s not the most important thing now. The focus is on the national team.”  A competition of this magnitude you don’t play every day.” Ronaldo just completed his third season at Juve and helped the team win the Coppa Italia. The Turin giants missed out on the Serie A title and were eliminated by FC Porto in the round of 16 of the Champions League. Ronaldo, who scored 36 goals in 44 appearances for Juve this past season goes into the tournament looking to break a few records. Should he hit the back of the net in this tournament, he will become the leading scorer in Euro finals as he is level on nine goals with France great Michel Platini.
