I wanted to become international armed robber like Mufu Olosha Oko and Oyenusi because I wanted my name to be popular. “In Nigeria we went for the first, second operations and the third one I was arrested and landed in prison. I urge government to tamper justice with mercy and help me.” Salami said Kikiowo and other paraded suspects would soon be charged to court, police said.
