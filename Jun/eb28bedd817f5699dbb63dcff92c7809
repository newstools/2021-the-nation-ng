The Osuivie and kingmaker of Ewu Community, Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State, Olorogun Michael Ohwofaria, on Tuesday said the Ewu Kingdom has only one crowned monarch, His Royal Majesty (HRM) Bernard Awarieta. The kingmaker and Osuivie of Ewu Kingdom made this statement while reacting to a publication in a community newspaper, credited to Mr Felix Onemu, parading somebody who did not collect the Ahavwa kingmakers form as king. Ohwofaria said only eight aspirants collected the Ahavwa Kingmakers’ form and the person Onemu is allegedly parading never picked Ahavwa kingmakers’ form; neither did Ekade Ruling House submit his name. Osuivie said: “When we wrote the Ekade Ruling House to submit their nominee for screening, nobody showed up to collect the form until April 20, 2021, which was the closing date. “So, he did not register with Ahavwa Kingmakers of Ewu Kingdom as one of the contestants and we closed him out of the race as Ekade Ruling House did not bring his name to us. “So, anybody parading himself as king is doing that on illegality and Ahavwa Kingmakers will not condone it because we have only one king which is His Royal Majesty, Bernard Awarieta, Ovie of Ewu-Urhobo Kingdom.”
