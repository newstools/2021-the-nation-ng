The Imo chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC), has called on opposition parties to join hands with Gov. Hope Uzodimma towards fighting security challenge in the state. The state APC Chairman, Mr Marcillinus Nlemigbo, said this while interacting with newsmen in Owerri on Friday. Nlemigbo who described as “frivolous” calls for the governor’s resignation over security challenge, urged stakeholders in the state to profer solutions to the problem. According to him, no amount of criminality will deter the state government in its commitment to recover, rehabilitate and reconstruct the state in line with the administration’s 3R mantra. ”As a responsible political party, we continue to call on peace loving persons in the state to join hands with government and all security agencies in their efforts to restore peace and security in our dear state. ”Rather than call on the governor to resign over security issues, we expect opposition parties in the state to come up with possible alternative solution to the situation. ”We have laboured over time to build Imo, our dear state and we must not allow uncanny elements, political or otherwise to destroy it,” he said. He, however, called on any aggrieved person in the state to embrace peace for the interest of all while condoling families of victims of security challenge. ”We call on all relevant stakeholders in the state to embrace peace for our collective interest and pray God to grant the families of victims of the unfortunate security situation, the grace to bear these losses with fortitude,” he said.
