The Management of Alex Ekwueme University Teaching Hospital (AEFUTH) has urged the public to disregard purported ongoing recruitment at the hospital. A statement issued in Abakaliki on Wednesday by the Director of Administration in the institution, Mr Calistus Okonkwo, described the “rumour as a figment of the imagination of the purveyors”. Okonkwo further described the purported recruitment as a scam and warned unsuspecting members of the public not to fall prey to the antics of the scammers. He said recruitment in the institution was always advertised in national dailies and that applicants were not being asked to pay money. “The management of AEFUTH, Abakaliki is by this notice, alerting the general public that there is no recruitment going on at the hospital let alone asking people to bring money. “It has come to the knowledge of the management that some unscrupulous elements are going about defrauding unsuspecting members of the public of money in the name of securing an appointment for them in the institution. “The worst of it is that they claim to be agents working for the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the hospital, Prof. Emeka Ogah. “The general public is therefore warned in their interests never to fall prey to these fraudsters as they may be taking a risk that they alone will be liable to. “The hospital’s management shall not be in a position to discuss any matter concerning giving out of money to anyone. “It never asked anybody to collect money on behalf of the CMD or any other members of the top management,” the statement added.
