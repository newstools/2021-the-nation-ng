The Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare has reiterated government’s commitment to supporting a trio of table tennis sensations Usman Okanlawon and the Mustapha brothers through the Talent Hunt Programme to aid their success. The minister gave this assurance in Abuja yesterday when he received the three athletes Okanlawon, Musa and Mustafa Mustafa who were led by the Caretaker Committee Chairman of Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF), Engr. Ishaku Tikon. Dare said their adoption into the fold of NTTF is very important as it would expose them to tournaments that would sharpen their skill through sponsorship. ‘ “We are excited because our emphasis on other sports is paying off. I’m excited and thrilled that Nigerian athletes are performing excellently well. Nigeria is proud of your performance which is an indication that our grassroots sports development is on a progressive chart,” Dare said. ”The Talents Hunt Programme of the ministry will adopt and support the Mustapha brothers and Okanlawon. They will be supported anytime they are to take part in the competition. They will be closely monitored so that they can continue to excel,” the minister added. Tikon, however, expressed delight that the Minister’s Talent Hunt Program was already yielding results, while thanking the minister for his immense support to the federation.
