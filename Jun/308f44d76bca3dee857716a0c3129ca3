Super Falcons’ coach Randy Waldrum has hailed the performance of the players for the dramatic comeback against Portugal at the Summer Series Invitational Tournament in the United States. Falcons trailed the Portuguese 2-0 and 3-1 at some stages in the game but their spirited efforts paid off after Rasheedat Ajibade scored in stoppage time to ensure both sides settled for a 3-3 draw in their second game of the tournament. Speaking after the tie, Waldrum praised the resilience of Nigeria’s women’s national team but warned that the team must work on their defensive frailties to have a chance against the host United States on Thursday. “I’m so proud of you girls with the fight we had and the way we came back,” Waldrum said. You were down by two goals two times in the game and you still mustered a comeback. It is a very difficult task to do but you stayed on and kept on pushing. You still have a lot to work on absolutely we will continue from here. “This is something we are going to build on to make us better to show that we are a good team and that we can fight and come back. That we are always in the team until the end of the game.”
