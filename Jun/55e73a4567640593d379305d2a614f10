Naomi Osaka will not receive any special treatment at Wimbledon this summer after the world No 2 withdrew from the French Open on Monday because of mental health concerns. The Japanese star pulled out at Roland Garros after refusing to attend mandatory post-match press conferences and revealing she had been suffering from bouts of depression for three years. She was also fined £10,800 by the tournament referee and threatened with exclusion from the French Open and future majors for refusing to face the media. Osaka has since returned to her home in Los Angeles as she begins her break from tennis. It has led to speculation whether or not she will compete at Wimbledon later this month but reports suggest the chances of that are ‘dwindling’.
