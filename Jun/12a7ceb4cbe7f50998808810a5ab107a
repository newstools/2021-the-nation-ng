The Police in Ondo State on Wednesday arrested a 35- year-old man, Kelvin Abugu, for allegedly defiling a nine-year-old girl in the state. Mr Bolaji Salami, the Commissioner of Police, made this known in Akure when parading 11 suspects alleged to have committed different offences and giving account of his stewardship since assuming duty in the state in May. Salami explained that on May 2 at about 1420hrs, the victim’s mother reported to the Police that she saw her daughter passing out blood from her private part. He said that when Emmanuel asked her daughter, she said it was one Kelvin Abugu, who inserted his hand and later his penis into her private part. According to him, the police swung into an action and Abugu was immediately arrested and later owned up to the offence. Salami said that the police had completed its investigation and the case was ready for prosecution, but for the closure of the courts due the Judicial workers strike. Speaking on the command’s achievements, the CP attributed the successes to ability of the officers to control situation, maintain high degree of professionalism and integrity in the discharge of their functions. “Like I always say, my system of policing is devoid of advertising, however, it is appropriate to tell someone sometimes exactly who you are and what you are doing. “Under this same period we have arrested various criminals for various offences, some of which were through media cooperation and useful information from members of public. “In one month, we arrested 11 suspects, recovered 26 generating sets and one Honda CRV Jeep. “Therefore, I am also using this medium to ask for more of media collaborative efforts and the good people of Ondo State to ensure that the Sunshine State remains the lowest crime rate in the country,” he said.
