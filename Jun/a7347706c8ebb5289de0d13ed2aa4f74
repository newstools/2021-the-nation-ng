The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) under the leadership of Ibrahim Shehu Gusau has announced that any election planned for Abuja will be null and void in line with the agreement between the World Athletics (WA), Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) and the AFN. According to the AFN President, Engr Ibrahim Shehu Gusau, the claim that World Athletics rejected the amended Constitution of the AFN is false, malicious with the intention of scuttling the roadmap for the 2021 AFN elections slated for Kebbi state. “The claim by these other people that the World Athletics has rejected the amended constitution is false and intended to deceive the delegates and the Athletics family. It is in recognition and acceptance of the amended Constitution that the world body reflected and still has Siminialayi Young Pepple as the Director-General of the AFN, with Engr. Gusau as President. Gusau termed the purported Congress slated for Abuja as a meeting of friends because according to Article 6.1.2 of the 2017 AFN Constitution, only the President of the AFN shall convene the Congress, while Article 19.1 of the 2019 edition states: The President of the AFN shall convene all Congress Meetings. It would be recalled that after the reconciliatory meeting held in Abuja, the Minister of Youth and Sports Sunday Dare thanked the CAA for their prompt response to the resolutions of the AFN crisis in a letter dated April 30, 2021. “In line with this Development, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development FMYSD, the supervisory body for all sports in Nigeria affirm our commitment to the resolutions and we will support the AFN to hold its Annual General Congress on June 14, 2021, guided by the AFN constitution of 16 November 2017, while we await the responses of CAA and WA”, Dare stated.
