UEFA has launched an investigation into “potential discriminatory incidents” during Hungary’s Euro 2020 group matches. The incidents are alleged to have taken place during Hungary’s opening 3-0 Group F defeat to Portugal on Tuesday and Saturday’s 1-1 draw against France. Both matches were staged at the Puskas Arena in Budapest, with 65,000 fans in attendance for the game against France. UEFA said in a statement that it had appointed an ethics and disciplinary inspector. The statement read: “In accordance with Article 31(4) of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations, an UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector has been appointed to conduct a disciplinary investigation regarding potential discriminatory incidents which occurred in the Puskas Arena, Budapest, during the 2020 European Championship group stage matches between the national teams of Hungary and Portugal on 15 June 2021 and between the national teams of Hungary and France played on 19 June 2021.” Hungary fans carried an anti-kneeling protest banner as they marched to the stadium for Saturday’s game and other banners saying ‘Brotherhood’ and ‘Magyarorszag (Hungary)’. The country’s prime minister Viktor Orban has said he supported the anti-kneeling protests and that “this kneeling business” should not take place on the pitch. Hungary sit bottom of Group F but can still qualify for the knockout stages if they beat Germany on Wednesday in their final group match at the Allianz Arena in Munich.
