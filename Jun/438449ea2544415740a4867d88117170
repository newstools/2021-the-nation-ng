The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Sunday said it has arrested the leader of a deadly syndicate of juju scammers, Abayomi Kamaldeen Alaka (aka Awise) for alleged N250million fraud. The EFCC said the leader and members of his syndicate have been operating  from a shrine in Ashipa town, near Abeokuta in Ogun State. A statement by EFCC spokesman  Wilson Uwujaren said the suspected syndicate allegedly tricked a woman to part with the N250million.  The statement said: “Awise’s arrest followed a petition by a victim, Bright Juliet who lost N250m to the syndicate after she was tricked to provide money for sacrifices and invocations to heal her of an ailment. She was introduced to Alaka by Akinola Bukola Augustina (aka Iya Osun) whom she met on Facebook in the course of her search for solutions to her health challenge. “What drew her to Augustina was the latter’s post under the name, Osunbukola Olamitutu Spiritual Healing Centre. “Once she contacted Augustina, the latter promised to heal her only if she pays N16million. The victim paid the money through an Access Bank account belonging to Mohammed Sani, who later turned out to be a bureau de change operator.  “After paying the money without receiving healing, Augustina passed the victim on to other members of the syndicate, notably Awise. “Juliet revealed that she met Awise at his shrines in Ashipa Town and was hypnotised and subsequently transferred various sums through bank accounts and in cash to the suspect and his syndicate members, until she lost N250million to them. “Despite all the monies collected from her, her health conditions never improved. She consequently petitioned the EFCC.
