As the political activities for the Osun State governorship scheduled to hold July next year get underway, the lawmaker representing Ede North/Ede/South/Egbedore/Ejigbo Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Bamidele Salam has dampened the quest of Dr Akin Ogunbiyi to contest the election on the platform of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP). He said Ogunbiyi who is one of the high contenders with Senator Ademola Adeleke for the party’s ticket would not be a good governor if given the chance. Ogunbiyi had contested for the PDP ticket in the last governorship election in the state but narrowly lost to Adeleke. He polled 1,562 votes, against Adeleke’s 1,569 votes. Ogunbiyi has declared interest in securing the ticket of the opposition party for next year’s election. Salam who was elected on the platform of the PDP made the remark while featuring on a private radio station in Osogbo, Rave FM monitored by our correspondent. He said Ogunbiyi can be useful in other political offices, except that of the governor. His words: “The party is not divided along (those backing) Dr Akin Ogunbiyi and Senator Ademola Adeleke; it is just a mere aspiration which is normal in politics. Politics is not about noise-making, it is about acceptability, networking and capacity. So, if anybody talks about the Adelekes’ today, it is like a brand, they have earned it, not like anybody dashed them. The senior Adeleke was the governor of Osun State. The family has a name that anyone desirous of political success can leverage on. “I know Dr Akin Ogunbiyi very well; he is a brother that I respect so much, but you know that when we talk about politics, we talk about the name, influence, networking, Ogunbiyi is nowhere near the Adelekes. I give him due honour, he is a very good and capable man but he can also be very useful in other areas but certainly not as the governor in this time around.”
