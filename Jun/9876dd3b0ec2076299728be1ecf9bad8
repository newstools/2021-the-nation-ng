Italy continued their perfect run in the European Championship with a 1-0 win against 10-man Wales at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday. While Italy dominated most of the game, they only managed to score once in the first half through Matteo Pessina despite Wales being reduced to 10 men when Ethan Ampadu was sent off after 55 minutes. Pessina’s goal came from a free kick conceded by Joe Allen on the far right edge of the penalty box on 39 minutes. Marco Verratti, who won the free, delivered a cross into the box and Pessina guided it into the goal. Wales improved in the second half but were dealt another blow when Ampadu was shown a straight red for a clumsy challenge on Federico Bernardeschi. Gareth Bale had an excellent opportunity to level on 75 minutes when he volleyed a ball over the bar that he should have pointed into Italy’s net. Despite the loss, Wales join Italy as the two teams to progress from the group. Switzerland will have to wait to see if they are one of the top four third place finishers. Switzerland beat Turkey 3-1 on Sunday but Wales’ superior goal difference meant they secured second place.
