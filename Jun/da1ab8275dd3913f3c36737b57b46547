A frontline Yoruba leader and the National President of Yoruba Patriot Movement (YPM), Chief Oladipupo Oladosu on Monday advised Oduduwa Republic agitators to push for constitutional review, rather than engaging in activities capable of destroying Nigeria’s peace and unity. Oladosu urged Yoruba and Igbo nationalities to learn to accommodate other tribes in the country, querying the future of minorities in the country. The Yoruba leader who spoke at a press conference in Ibadan stated that those agitating for secession cannot be blamed because the government has failed them. He said; “There is strength in our diversity and population. We need Hausa/Fulani, we need Igbo and we need other groups to survive. We cannot blame those agitating for secession because the government has failed them.” The constitutional lawyer said there must be a constitution that will give succor to all Nigerians. He said; “The only thing that can give Nigeria stability is to return to 1963 federal constitution, and it can be modified with the outcome of the 2014 constitutional national conference.”
