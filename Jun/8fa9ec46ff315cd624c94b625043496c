Who advised Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, to travel abroad amid the insecurity rocking his state – especially with the kidnap of pupils of Salihu Tanko Islamic School in Rafi Local Government? Bandits had invaded the school on Sunday evening in their numbers on motorcycles and abducted pupils. Efforts to rescue the children have been on since then. But when news broke during the week that the governor left for a trip abroad, all hell was let loose with parents of the children and others within and outside the state, chastising Bello for travelling while bandits are still holding the kids. Some prominent personalities have added their voices to the expression of disappointment over the governor’s alleged trip. “If truly the governor left the state after the kidnap of those helpless children, it is unfortunate,” a former zonal official of the ruling party said in Abuja on Thursday. In a statement, Mary Noel-Berje, Chief Press Secretary to the governor, stated that Bello assured the state of the rescue and safe return of the students. Confirming stories making the round, she added that the governor is expected back in the country “within the shortest period”. That hasn’t stopped the opposition and other stakeholders from wondering why Bello chose a time like this to stay away from the state.
