Tears flowed freely as the remains of the Policeman killed by kidnappers, Inspector Adewumi Abiola, was laid to rest in his family home, in Igbemo Ekiti, Irepodun/ Ifelodun Council Area of Ekiti state. Abiola was murdered on June 16, 2022, by kidnappers while trying to protect the expatriates handling the Ogun/Oyo State Railway Project from abduction at a site in Ogun State. The slain policeman corpse was brought from Ibadan by a team of Police Officers to his ongoing building project in Igbemo Ekiti, where his remains were buried amid wailing and lamentations. The late police officer was survived by an 80-year old mother, Mrs. Olubiyo Abiola, a young wife and four female children, who are still in primary schools. The slain policeman’s elder sister, Mrs. Caroline Bamigboye said Abiola was buried quickly because over 20 bullets pierced his body and were difficult to remove. Mrs. Caroline Bamigboye and Mr. Taiwo Ogunrinde, led family members to the site in Odeda. The former Chairman, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Ekiti Council and an uncle to the deceased, High Chief Laolu Omosilade, applauded the efforts of the Oyo State Commissioner of Police, Mrs. Vivian Ngozi Onadeko, for her swift action that hastened the release of the body for burial. Omosilade appealed to the Chinese Company, CCECC Railway construction Company, the Police Authority, the Oyo and Ekiti State governments, to assist the late cop’s mother, wife and children. “The most pathetic aspect of the old woman was the fact that his brother, who had a hunchback, was also gruesomely murdered by alleged ritualists about four years ago along Aramoko /Itawure road, in Ekiti State. “The woman is seriously troubled and traumatised. She relied on Adewumi for survival and that life support has been removed now. People must show empathy towards this distraught woman. “They must come out and display humanitarian help towards her as a citizen of this nation,” the ex-NUJ Chief said.
