Like many have written about him, his commitment to progressive national ethos amid the challenges besetting our nation is writ large in his poetry, essays and columns over the years. “I may not necessarily agree to everything he writes, but I must admit that Sam has always been a master at putting pen to paper in the expression of very thoughtful perspectives that provoke deep thoughts. “Since his days at the now-defunct Concord newspapers, he has never shied away from registering a unique presence within the daily swirl of public discourse. “Now, as he joins the sexagenarian club which various African cultures accord high esteem and respect, I felicitate with my dear friend, Sam Omatseye. “I also wish him a long, happy and fulfilling life as he moves on to a higher pedestal in age and impactfulness of his journalism career,” Senator Omo-Agege said.
