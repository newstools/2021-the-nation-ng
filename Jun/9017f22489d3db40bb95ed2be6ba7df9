Teachers must get the National Assembly’s nod before they can extend their retirement as announced by President Muhammadu Buhari five months ago, The Nation has learnt. The National Pension Commission (PenCom) made this known during the training for Pension Desk Officers in Lagos. Some teachers at the training enquired to know their fate on the announcement of the president. The president approved a special salary scale and new retirement age for teachers in commemoration of the World Teachers Day. He increased the number of service years for the teachers from 35 to 40 and retirement age from 60 to 65. Over the years, teachers have continued to agitate, among others, an increase in their retirement age, welfare and salaries. An official of the Pencom Contribution Bond and Redemption Department, Aliu Sanni, said the commission was awaiting the gazette before the teachers could extend their age or service year. He said: “The teachers have to hold on for the declaration of the president to become law and be gazette. As it, teachers, whose salaries are on IPPIS, will still stop when they attain 60 or 35 years in service and procedure for pension payment will begin. “But after the gazette, any teacher who feels like extending his or age can still work if he or she still gains employment. It has happened before to some university lecturers. Some of the them had retired before the age extension was gazetted and we processed their accrued right. “But some of them went back to the job and they were accepted to spend additional five years. Meanwhile, their accrued right has already been paid to their Retirement Savings Account (RSA). All we did was to pay the difference of the five additional years because they still had contributions in their RSA when they came back,” he added.
