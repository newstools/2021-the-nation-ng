 A tipper truck at the weekend crushed a final-year female student of the Petroleum Training Institute, Effurun, Uvwie council area of Delta State. The Nation gathered that the incident occurred around 8pm at the main gate of the PTI. It was learnt that the student, identified simply as Uwa, was trying to cross the road when the truck, without headlights and driving against traffic, knocked her down. According to reports, she was immediately rushed toÂ  hospital by students and other sympathisers, but later died in the early hours of Saturday.  Uwa was an HND 2 student of the institution. The driver of the truck was reported to have taken off after the incident to avoid a mob attack, but was held by some security officers. Following news of her death, angry students blocked the PTI Road in protest for several hours on Saturday. Chairman of the Local Government Area Ramson Onoyake intervened.
