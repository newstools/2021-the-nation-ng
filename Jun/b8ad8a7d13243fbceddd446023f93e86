Gunmen who abducted pupils of Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Niger State have demanded N110 million for their release. The school head-teacher Abubakar Alhassan said the bandits contacted the school on Monday asking for the money. Alhassan told reporters on the telephone that the bandits said they have 156 children in their custody and will kill them if the money was not paid. He lamented the state governmentâ€™s insistence not to pay ransom, choosing only to negotiate with the bandits. The community and parents of the children have started sourcing the ransom cash, it was learnt.
