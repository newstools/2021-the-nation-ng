Former Leicester City striker Tony Cottee spoke of Kelechi Iheanacho’s mental toughness after the Nigeria forward lit up King Power Stadium and many away venues throughout 2021. The Nigerian found the net 19 times for the Foxes throughout 2020/21, with all but three of those strikes coming in between February and May. It was a period during which he was undoubtedly in the form of his career, and his performances left Cottee – often on co-commentary for LCFC Radio – thrilled with what he was witnessing from the fellow frontman. Speaking to LCFC.com, Cottee explains why Iheanacho has had to show mental toughness to become a key member of the City squad. “Since he arrived from Manchester City, Jamie Vardy has been so good, so it’s been difficult for him,” Cottee said. “Football is obviously about your skills and talent, but it’s also just as much about your mental side of the game. “Putting myself in Kelechi’s shoes, it must have been hard to deal with that, but what I admire about him – I think it was the game I covered for LCFC Radio – he came into the team against Fulham and he scored. “It wasn’t just that he scored, though. It was his overall game and contribution to the team. From that moment onwards, he just had so much confidence and that sort of arrogance as a centre-forward that you’re going to score every time you play,” he noted.
