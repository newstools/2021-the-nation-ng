England have been dealt a major blow as Trent Alexander-Arnold has been ruled out of Euro 2020 due to a thigh injury. Alexander-Arnold limped out of England’s 1-0 friendly win over Austria on Wednesday night after picking up a knock, leading to fears over his participation in the summer tournament. A subsequent scan has now revealed that the Liverpool defender has suffered a grade two quadricep tear, which will keep him out of action for between four to six weeks. The England camp have released an official statement confirming the news, which reads: “Trent Alexander-Arnold has been ruled out of UEFA EURO 2020. “The Liverpool player sustained a thigh injury in the closing stages of Wednesday’s 1-0 win against Austria in Middlesbrough. “A scan on Thursday confirmed the 22-year-old will be unable to play in the forthcoming tournament so he’s withdrawn from the England squad. “Gareth Southgate will not confirm a replacement until after Sunday’s return to the Riverside Stadium for the warm-up fixture against Romania.” Liverpool has released their own statement revealing that the defender will now return to Anfield to begin his recovery. “Trent Alexander-Arnold has withdrawn from England’s Euro 2020 squad due to injury,” the club briefing states. “The 22-year-old will immediately start a rehabilitation programme with a view to returning in pre-season as the Reds prepare for 2021-22.” Goal
