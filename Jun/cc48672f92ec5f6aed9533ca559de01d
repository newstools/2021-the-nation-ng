By OLUSHOLA RICKETTS  Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, last Tuesday went all out to celebrate his triplets – Ragnar, Aiden and Liam – who turned three. While the estranged mother of the boys, Precious Chikwendu, was missing, the likes of Senator Grace Bent, Dr Kemi Olunloyo and Susan Ade-Coker were spotted at the party. Recall that the former beauty queen had approached the court to grant her custody of her four kids from the union, following their messy breakup, but no resolution has been reached yet. The celebration, which took place at Fani-Kayode’s Abuja residence, kicked off with a prayer session presided over by Rev. Bayo Oladeji, Rev Emmanuel Omata and Rev Emmanuel Olorumagba.  Thereafter, it was fun all the way, as the celebrants received exciting gifts from their dad’s rich friends and family members. Mum Chikwendu, however, didn’t let the day go by without penning words of adoration for her triplets. While thanking God for their new age and keeping them healthy, she said she was willing to continue to fight for their custody. The message posted earlier in the day read in part: “I am grateful to God for a new year, thankful for how far the almighty has kept you alive and in health despite the odds. Three years of having my Liver (Ragnar), Kidney (Aiden) and Liam (Heart) walk around the earth and gladdening my heart with so much warmth and laughter. It was a fight physically and medically to sustain your conception and another fight to cater to you as a mother would regardless of “status quo” and I am glad and willing to fight on as you are worth every fight. I’ve placed you all in the hands of the almighty, knowing that anything given to him for keeps is safe till I have you all back in my loving arms.”
