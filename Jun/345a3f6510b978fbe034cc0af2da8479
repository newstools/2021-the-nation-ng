Very reliable sources in Calabar, the Cross River State capital, said during the week that Governor Ben Ayade is not joking when he said he will turn the state into an All Progressives Congress (APC) fortress in the shortest time possible. “Ayade believes in his new party, the APC and he is very serious about making it the party of the people of the state in no time. He is working hard at achieving that feat,” a top politician in the state told Sentry. In addition, it was gathered that the governor has made it clear to all his aides, associates, and all other appointed and elected officials that he intends to have only APC members in his administration. “While he is appreciating those who daily join him in his new party, he is frowning at those who are still foot-dragging,” the source said. Some observers of the politics of the state even claimed that the governor is prepared to sack all those unwilling to join his new party from his administration. They claim that the recent firing of some commissioners and Special Advisers was the first step in that direction Ayade sacked four Commissioners and five Special Advisers during the week. They are Asu Okang, Commissioner for Information, Donatus Etim of the Climate Change Ministry, Rita Ayim, Commissioner for Women Affairs, and Mike Usibe who was also the Commissioner for New Cities Development. If feelers are to be taken serious, more appointees of the government, within and outside the cabinet, will still be excused from the administration if they fail to make swift their decision on whether to port into the governor’s new vehicle or not.
