Medical doctors in Ondo State under the auspices of the National Association of Government General Medical and Dental Practitioners (NAGGMDP) on Thursday began a two weeks warning strike over alleged poor welfare by the state government. This warning strike action is coming few weeks after the doctors called off indefinite strike action overpayment of percentage salaries. The doctors gave notice of the strike action in a letter addressed to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and signed by both Chairman and Secretary of NAGGMDP, Dr Roland Arohunmolase, and Dr. Richard Obe respectively, In the letter, the doctors said the industrial action was as a result of non-payment of salaries arrears, gross under-staffing of government hospitals following a mass exodus of doctors and other health workers from the state, non-regular payment of salaries and non-harmonization of doctors’ grade level. Other reasons adduced were percentage payment of salaries to health workers, non-payment of the third tranche of COVID-19 allowance and non-implementation of Group Life Insurance for all Health workers. The letter reads in parts, “Against this backdrop, we wish to let you know that our members have been overstretched and their emotional intelligence badly affected. “Ondo State is being overpopulated and this has increased the numbers of patient patronage at various government-owned health facilities. Invariably it has become unbearable to cope with the deplorable state of things in Ondo State Government-owned hospitals. “It is not the wish of our members to proceed on this industrial action, but it is necessary to draw your attention and that of the citizenry to the afore-mentioned. “The Association hopes Mr. Governor will do the needful in addressing our dissatisfaction as contained in this letter.”
