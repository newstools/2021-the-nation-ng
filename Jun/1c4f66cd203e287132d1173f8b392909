Nollywood veteran, Hilda Dokubo, has inaugurated a youth club, ‘Orange Brigade’ for secondary school students to fight abuses and violence against young people in Rivers state. Dokubo, who is the Founder and Executive Director, Centre for Creative Arts Education, a Non-Governmental Organization(NGO), said the club is aimed at providing a platform for young people to speak up against abuses including sexual abuse, violence and harassments especially, those that affect them, using drama, films and creative writings as tools to pass the message. “The brigade is all about young people using drama, creative writing, films for advocacy, it is about the adultescence, teens speaking up against all forms of abuses, sexual harassments, violence, mental and physical against their person, among others,” the actress said. Speaking on the initiative and reason behind it, Dokubo said, “Over times, the media and society have been inundated with news, records of abuses on young people, mostly during the covid-19 pandemic lockdown. “This is my organisation’s way of getting the young people to speak up against violence and abuses and also make genuine contributions in the fight against these concerns of grave consequences. “It is appropriate to start from schools, and that the need for proper management of the activities of the club necessitated the take-off from schools. “We want their activities to be managed properly, we do not want anything to go wrong, so we will be needing the inputs of their teachers, mostly in the areas of organization, direction and advise to the young participants, members,” the actress explained.
