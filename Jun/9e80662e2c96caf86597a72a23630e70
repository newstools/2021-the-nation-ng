The Enugu State Police Command has said that it has no information on the accident that led to the death of Ebonyi Commissioner for Infrastructure and Concession, Fidelis Kings Nweze, 11 days ago. Our correspondent found that no accident occurred at Eke Obinagu along the Enugu-Abakiliki in the past two weeks.
Ebonyi State Governor had while announcing Nweze’s death last Tuesday, said: “Nweze died this (June 22) morning at Turkish Hospital, Abuja at about 9:50 am. “He was travelling to Enugu on Saturday morning with his driver and orderly. At Obinagu in Enugu State, they rammed into a stationary truck.” Nweze was also said to have been rushed to Niger Foundation in Enugu, from where he was moved to the Turkish International Hospital, Abuja where he died after “a successful operation”. However, when contacted on the telephone at the weekend, spokesman for the Enugu State Police Command, Daniel Ndukwe, said: “I am not aware of such accident. We don’t have any information on it.” He told our correspondent to contact the Ebonyi Police command to get the actual place of the accident. Also, when The Nation visited the axis on Enugu-Abakiliki Road on Friday, some members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), traffic wardens at Eke Obinagu and members of a task force, said no accident had been recorded between Emene and Nkalagu axis of the highway in the past two weeks. A traffic warden at Eke Obinagu, who declined to give his name, said the only accident he could remember occurred close to the mouth of the bridge near Orie Emene Community Market on June 16, three days before the commissioner’s reported case. Umahi has said he would adopt the late Nweze’s family even after the end of his tenure on May 29, 2023. “I have become the father of the family till eternity and I will stand by the family even when I leave office because of the life he lived,” he said during a church service at Christ Embassy in Abakaliki on Sunday.
