Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) witnessed another ugly incident in Jos yesterday when irate home fans went berserk and attacked players and officials of Enyimba FC during the matchday 29 game against Plateau United which ended goalless at New Jos Stadium. NationSport learnt that the fans started the attack when Enyimba’s player Timothy Danladi was ushered out of the stadium by the security operatives after his red card offense which was handed to him toward the end of the additional time. The game which was supposed to be played under closed doors had some fans in attendance and as soon as the referee blew the final whistle the fans invaded the pitch and started stoning the players and officials of the away team. The team was also held hostage in their dressing room for several minutes before they managed to escape to their hotel. It was understood that Enyimba goalkeeper Jerry Basal and Dare Olatunji were badly injured and they were treated by the team’s doctors. Recounting the ordeal, Enyimba’s assistant coach Hamza Abara said: “We narrowly escaped to our hotel. Before the end of the additional three minutes, one of our defenders got a red card and when the security operatives were trying to accompany out, the home fans started stoning him and our bench side. “Although, security operatives tried to calm them but as soon as the referee blew the final whistle, the fans rushed towards our team and started throwing stones at us and injured our players,” he added.
