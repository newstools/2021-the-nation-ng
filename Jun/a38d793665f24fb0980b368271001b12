Some players have  reportedly decided to boycott the Super Eagles friendly match with the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon this weekend in Austria due to unpaid moneys promised during the recent African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers. While the official reason for the other withdrawals have been medical, player sources have alleged that outstanding debts from the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) have played a big part in their unwillingness to risk further injury. “The players are not happy,” the source, who is one of the players who withdrew from the game, alleged to ESPN. “They have not paid bonuses and allowances, nothing at all for the entire [2021] AFCON qualifiers. “We have sacrificed by playing throughout the qualifiers without being paid. I think now, with all the injuries, it is hard for many of us to make the sacrifice to come and play a meaningless friendly when the outstanding bonuses have not been paid. “It is better for us to stay away, recover properly, rest and get ready for the new season and the World Cup qualifiers.” This leaves coach Gernot Rohr’s preparations for the upcoming friendly in disarray, leaving the worried German tactician uncertain if the game will go ahead. “I don’t know if they can cancel, I only know that I have a maximum of 18 players,” a concerned Rohr told ESPN. “If the players from England, William (Troost-Ekong), Kelechi, Ndidi and Iwobi can come, then maybe we play but I have no substitutes and there is no chance to get other players. “But if they cannot play because they have to go into quarantine, then we cannot make it,” he added. “My problem now is that I hope that we will have 18 players to arrive.”
