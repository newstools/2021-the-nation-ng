Actress-turned-preacher Eucharia Anunobi has recounted how her wealthy father refused sending her to school as a girl child. In a lengthy post accompanied with a video shared via her Instagram page on Tuesday, June 22, 2021, the movie icon went down memory lane on the ill-treatment she got from her father and what she has eventually become after all said and done. She wrote: “If you are still in doubt about God’s grace, read the caption below. Am still in awe of God. He changes destinies in a twinkling of an eye. He is the rule-breaker  He doesn’t need anyone’s permission to bless someone ” “Just look at the girl, whose rich father refused to train after high school, that he had no need for a girl child. That the female gender is useless to him and can’t carry his name anywhere. That he rather concentrate and train the male children to any level of education that they desire.” The movie icon went on to share receipts of all that she has been able to achieve as a woman. She wrote: “And this girl child struggled all by herself and is a model, a former beauty Queen, a famous superstar actress, a preacher. AND NOW THAT GIRL CHILD IS A PH.D. HOLDER IN CHRISTIAN EDUCATION AND MINISTERIAL ARTS.” The absolutely awe-struck and grateful Eucharia added: “AND SHE HAS ENGRAVED HER FATHER’S NAME ON THE MAP OF THE WORLD AND STILL CARVING IT AND WILL KEEP CARVING IT UNTIL THE RETURN OF JESUS CHRIST !! I AM THAT GIRL CHILD AND MY NAME IS APOSTLE DR EUCHARIA AKUWA ANUNOBI 
Celebrate God on my behalf.”
