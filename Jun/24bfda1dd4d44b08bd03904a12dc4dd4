Imo State Deputy Governor, Prof. Placid Njoku yesterday refutes the claim that he has resigned, saying that the report is baseless. Prof. Njoku said in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ozioma Teddy Ukwuoma that the story has no iota of truth in it, adding that it was the handiwork of those who had been working to destabilise the state. The statement reads in part: “My attention has been drawn to the fake news circulating in the social media purporting that the Deputy Governor of Imo State, Prof. Placid Njoku has resigned. While it remains our practice to ignore such baseless stories, the need to put the truth out to our concerned Imo citizens has necessitated this rebuttal. “The story has no iota of truth in it but is a mere figment of the imaginations of those working against the government and people of Imo State. “The Imo State Deputy Governor, Prof. Placid Njoku enjoys a robust working relationship with his boss, Governor Hope Uzodimma, and indeed with every member of the state executive council, including members of the state legislature.” He enjoined Imo people to disregard such rumours and continue supporting the peace and development of Imo State.
