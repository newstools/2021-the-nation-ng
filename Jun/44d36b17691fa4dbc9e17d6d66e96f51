 US-based filmmaker, Emmanuel Maduka Unegbu says his new flick, De Wedding Gift, will bridge the gap between Nollywood and Hollywood. At an event held in Lagos and supported by CMC Gladiators of Africa, Unegbu said he was shocked to discover that the skills and talents in Nollywood were beyond his expectations. The Nigerian-American said: “The cast and crew members performed beyond my expectation. The only difference I can identify between Hollywood and Nollywood is budgeting. The Nollywood productions are relatively lower than The Hollywood high-budget productions.” Continuing, Unegbu said, “I believe that collaboration between Hollywood and Nollywood will create a positive transference of knowledge, skill sets, and ideas, which will be a win-win for both industries. Many producers in Nollywood would like to explore the parties. And we will create that enabling platform for such all-important cross-linkage.”
