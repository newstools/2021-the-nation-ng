Tony, husband of Ex-BBNaija “Double Wahala” season 4 housemate, Nina has reacted to her decision to undergo cosmetic surgery. The Nation reported BBNaija star Nina Ivy had come under heat from social media users after being dragged by a body enhancement brand for undergoing plastic surgery barely three weeks after she allegedly signed a deal with them as their influencer. The reality TV star had slammed critics insulting her over her decision to get her body done. She wrote: “A lot of you are hypocrites. Most of you be suffering from depression cos you don’t want your current body and no money for surgery cos you can’t afford one. So all you gotta do is sit and judge. Sis, I got my body done. I took out my fat and put it where I need it more and damn this my new body is killing me. I did it for me and not for any of you.” Tony has however also reacted to this and according to him, he is quite pleased with her decision to undergo plastic surgery to make her butt bigger. The social media personality’s husband in reacting posted a drawing of a female butt pressing hard on a male’s face almost in a bid to suffocate him and which he accompanied with a big smile emoji. The said image had inscriptions that read; “Big yansh”, “Me”; “I guess”
