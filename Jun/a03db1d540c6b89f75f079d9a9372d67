National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) yesterday said it has arrested 286 drug suspects, 25 of whom female. Out of the total suspects held, 155 persons have been arraigned in court with 78 convictions, while 77 cases are pending, the agency said. NDLEA Kano State Commander, Isah Likita Mohammed, who briefed reporters at the agency’s headquarters, added that four Cannabis Sativa farms were destroyed and  about 8,983.461kg of illicit drugs seized. The illicit drugs, which were seized in 11 months, comprised of 7,701.906 kg of Cannabis Sativa, 1,281.333 kg of psychotropic substances, 0.157 kg of Cocaine and 0.065 kg of heroin. Speaking at a conference in commemoration of this year’s International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, the NDLEA commander said the fight against drug abuse requires the participation of every member of the society, if the war against the scourge must succeed. He advised lawmakers in the country against legalising the use of illicit drugs because of economic value (revenues), considering the negative impacts on the society. Mohammed appealed to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to complete the rehabilitation centre at the NDLEA headquarters to improve its operation at optimum capacity in drug demand reduction, particularly in the area of rehabilitation of drug dependent persons.
