Senate Chief Whip Senator Orji Uzor Kalu has warned agitators in the Southeast against re-enacting events which led to the 1967 Civil War. Kalu, a former Governor of Abia State, described the insecurity in the region as strange, noting that the Igbo were not known for burning of people’s homes under any guise. In a statement, he signed, Kalu questioned the rationale in killing policemen and military officers, who protect them, their families and others. He urged them to have a rethink and choose a more righteous way of expressing their grievances. He said: “The policemen and military officers who are being killed are fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, children and relatives. Anyone that has lost a close relative knows what it means to lose parents or children. I am more concerned about the lives lost because of the trickle-down effects on families. “Our people are not known for burning homes to punish enemies. Destroying police stations and infrastructure can never be the best path to express grievances. Whenever the 1967 to 1970 Civil War is mentioned, it is an emotive experience for any peace-loving Nigerian, not just an Igbo man.” The Senator urged the security agencies to desist from harassing, molesting and killing young people in the region. He said he was worried that some security agents were reported to be killing youngsters. “It is better to thoroughly conduct your investigations and avoid the indiscriminate killings of young innocent Igbo men. Our people have raised the alarm and we are very worried at the rate of disappearance and deaths of innocent young men. Some of our young people now live indoors for the fear of being tagged unknown gunmen,” he said. The Chief Whip reaffirmed his call for a national dialogue chaired by the President.
