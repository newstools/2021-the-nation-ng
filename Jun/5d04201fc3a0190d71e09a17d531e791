The All Progressives Congress(APC) in the southeast has postponed the official commissioning of its secretariat to a future date in honour of murdered chieftain of the party, Ahmed Gulak. A statement signed by Southeast representative and member
National Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Senator Ken Nnamani, said the postponement was to honour Gulak. The statement reads: “In honour of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak who was gruesomely murdered recently, the circumstance and place of death,’ we have decided to postpone the official commissioning of our SouthEast APC Zonal Secretariat to a future date. “Alhaji Gulak was a notable stalwart of our party and a very good friend of many of us from the SouthEast Chapter of APC.
We condemn without mincing words the murder of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak and call on security agencies to unravel the circumstances surrounding his death. “We equally condemn the uncivilized acts of destroying government properties and attacks on uniformed operatives. “All utterances and conducts capable of inciting people must be discontinued.
