The Niger State government has honoured 12 class teachers, head teachers and Education Secretaries for their outstanding performance and dedication to duty. The award was conducted by the Niger State Universal Basic Education Board (NSUBEB). Four Education Secretaries, three Head teachers, one Principal and four teachers got the award. The Deputy Governor, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Ketso, who presented the awards, said teachers were vital to nation-building and social change. “Indeed teachers are the most veritable stakeholders in the education system. I believe the desire to identify and award deserving teachers at this time is very apt as we consolidate on creating a sustainable education system in the State,” he said. He praised Niger SUBEB for boosting teaching and learning through capacity development of the educators. “The empowerment of teachers is a priority to us because we cannot raise the quality of our students without first standardising the quality of those who are to impart the character and knowledge,” he said. Chairman, Niger SUBEB, Dr Isah Adamu said the Board identified those who had distinguished themselves despite challenges for the award. He noted that the recipients were selected because they satisfied the the process. Speaking on behalf of the awardees, the Education Secretary, Kontagora Local Government appreciated the NSUBEB for recognising their efforts and assured of more commitment to work
