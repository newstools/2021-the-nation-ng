Fidson Healthcare Plc, one of the country’s leading pharmaceutical manufacturers, has floated a talent competition for children through its Fidvite brand, a multivitamin syrup that supports the healthy growth and development of children aged 2 to 10. The Fidvite talent competition, tagged My Child Can, seeks to celebrate children by asking parents to showcase their children’s talent and what they can do. The contest was announced during this year’s Children’s Day celebration, which Fidson hosted at the Police College Ground in Ikeja, in partnership with the Lagos State Government. The event, which was graced by 3,000 students and other stakeholders in the education sector, also had in attendance the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu; his Deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, and other top government functionaries. Fidson explained further through its social media platform that the competition is another way of “appreciating the hope and happiness that children bring to our lives.” Any child within the age of two – 10  years with any form of mental, physical, or unique dexterity can participate in the competition, with submission of entries closing on June 8. Each participant stands the chance of winning up to N1 million, among other cash prizes and weekly consolation prizes. “To participate, parents are encouraged to visit www.fidvite.com/mychildcan www..com/mychildcan for detailed instructions and follow the conversation on various social media platforms using the hashtag #MyChildCan.”
