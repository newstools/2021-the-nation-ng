  Kidnappers and bandits have changed tactics to circumvent tracking through telephone calls. They now use their victims’ handsets to negotiate for ransom, the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) said yesterday. Its Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) Prof Umar Danbatta, who dropped the hint, said criminals invented the method to frustrate security agencies. Danbatta was at the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) where Communication and Digital Economy Minister Isa Pantami presented his ministry’s scorecard. The event was organised by the APC Professionals Forum. Responding to why the security agencies cannot track kidnappers and bandits after the nationwide SIM registration, the NCC boss  said: “The federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy through the NCC is alive to this important responsibility of containing crimes. We provide information about the person committing the crime within the shortest possible time to the relevant security agents in our country. “The kidnappers when they abduct their victims , they change tactics. Before now, they were making calls with their own handsets, now they are using the handsets of their own victims. So, when you visit the database you can’t come up with the information of the kidnappers. Dambatta added: “Every registered SIM has the biographic and demographic of the holder. Once such a SIM is used to perpetrate any crime we can easily through information in the data base be able to come up with the identity of the person who perpetrate the crime. We have been doing that all along.” The NCC boss assured Nigerians that the ministry and his Commission are trying their best to tackle kidnapping.
