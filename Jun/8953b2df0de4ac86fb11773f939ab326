Rotary International District (9110) Governor Bola Oyebade has advised youths in business to not only produce but also market their products. He said they could do so by using appropriate materials such as label, and identifying the market segment to sell, among others, adding that being in business was not only about showing one’s presence but rather making profit. Oyebade, a motivational speaker, said: “Think as a businessman and woman. Think of how you can move to the next level, which should be twice where you are now. Market your trade. Go online. If you do not sell, it means you have not made a difference.’’ He stated this during the organisation’s yearly Community Economic Development programme last weekend where it donated some start up items worth over N2 million to 24 youths. The beneficiaries included Funmi Fashola, Salami, Abdullahi, Kenshiro Abike, Towe Omotunde, Abidoye Omolara, Nuremi Abike,  and Rafiu Motunrayo. The items were mixers, interlock, stamping and stoning machines, industrial gas cooker and cylinder, and generators, among others. Oyebade said they should use the items judiciously for what they were meant — business — instead of storekeeping them. He added this would not only encourage Rotarians to give more to others in future but also to help them should they need support to grow their businesses. The Chairman, District 9110 Community Economic Development, Lekan Bade-John, said the event was Rotary’s entrepreneurial programme aimed at empowering youths to be self employed, be employers and generate income. It is one of the seven focal areas of Rotary, he added. “Giving money is not enough. We look out for people and we train them,’’ he said. He said the beneficiaries were prequalified and that only the best were enlisted.
