A man has beaten his wife to death in Edo State because she did not loan him N2,000. The man simply identified as Christopher, 45, reportedly called his wife Isoken on the telephone to ask for N2,000 loan, but did not get the money upon returning home, and started beating his wife. His oldest son Augustine, 13, who described his father as a chain smoker and drunk, said the suspect tried to flee their two-room apartment in Benin after the alleged crime but was apprehended by residents who handed him over to police. The incident took place on Saturday. Augustine further said his father is troublesome and often beat his mother. He said: “I tried to give my mother paracetamol and water after the initial beating, but my father threw them away. She then went to bathe, after which she lay down outside to rest before coming inside to sleep, but my father locked us inside the room and resumed the beating of my weak mother outside. “Neighbours later helped us (the three children) to open the door, only to see our dead mother on the ground. She was rushed to two different hospitals in the neighbourhood, and was confirmed dead.” Police spokesman Bello Kotongs confirmed the incident.
