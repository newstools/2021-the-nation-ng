The monarch of Arigidi Akoko, Oba Yisa Olanipekun, on Monday explained why the town is pushing for the burial of Prophet Temitope Joshua in the community. Prophet TB Joshua hailed from Arigidi Akoko. Speaking with The Nation at Arigidi, Oba Olanipekun said other clergymen like Prophet Moses Orimolade was buried in his Ikare hometown. Oba Olanipekun stated that burying TB Joshua in Arigidi would ensure his philanthropic legacy remained in the heart of the people. He said the late founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) touched persons living in every nook and cranny of Akoko land. Oba Olanipekun said his greatest regret was that TB Joshua could not complete the university project in Arigidi. “He would bring rice to the people whenever we requested. He hated to see people go hungry. “He was instrumental to the electrification of many communities in Akoko land after years of darkness,” the monarch said.
