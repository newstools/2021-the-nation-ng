Air Peace has introduced  new connections to offer the public more network options and satisfy their air travel needs. They are the Port Harcourt-Kano-Port Harcourt, Port Harcourt-Benin-Port Harcourt  routes and resumption of flights on Kano-Asaba-Kano route. Spokesperson of Air Peace, Stanley Olisa, who made this known to reporters, stated that the Kano-PHC-Kano flights would start today, and operate twice weekly while flights on the Asaba-Kano-Asaba route, billed to have started yesterday, would run three days a week. However, flights on the Benin-PHC-Benin route, will kick off on June 18, and operate on Fridays and Sundays. “Tickets for these new connections are already selling and the flying public can start booking on our website flyairpeace.com or the mobile app”, he said. He added that the new connections further reflected Air Peace’s commitment to providing strategic connectivity which addresses the gaps in the nation’s air travel. Also, the airline is set to launch scheduled daily flights to Ilorin from Lagos and Abuja on June 17, 2021, and plans to kick off flights on the Gombe and Ibadan routes soon. Air Peace services 16 domestic routes, five regional routes and  two international destinations, including Johannesburg, and boasts of a mixed fleet of 28 aircraft, including two new Embraer 195-E2 jets, delivered earlier this year, with 11 more lined up for delivery.
