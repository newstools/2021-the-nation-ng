The Language, Arts and Culture Day at Chrisland Schools, Lagos, provides an opportunity to remind its pupils of Nigeria’s rich cultural heritage, says its Principal, Mr. Eric Van Der Merwe. Speaking at the event held at the school’s premises in Opebi, Merwe lamented that many pupils were not in touch with their culture. “Nigeria has one of the best cultures in the world and this is what has kept me back in Nigeria for the past 11 years. As a school, we have discovered that a lot of students are not in touch with their background and culture, hence the reason for this occasion. This is an event the school has successfully done each year as a way of keeping students in touch with their roots,” he said. The event, which featured fashion parade, dances and other presentations reflective of the cultures from the six geo-political zones of the country, dramas and a local food fair, had as theme: “One Root, Many Branches.” Special guest at the occasion, Olufunke Rekiya Hassan of Onigbongbo Local Council Development Authority, described the event as remarkable and praised Chrisland High School for its commitment to the promotion of culture. “We must highlight and promote our culture, not just as matter of individual preferences or styles but collectively as our national identity. I applaud the organisers, Chrisland Schools, for serving as custodians of our rich cultural legacy, which is one of our resources,’ she said. Also present at the event were Oba Olusegun Adeyemi Ajasa, Awuse of Onigbongbo Kingdom; Mrs Mofoluke Oluwasanmi of the Lagos State Council for Arts and Culture and Mrs Osayande Osaro of the Centre for Black African Art and Civilisation.
