Budding Afrobeat singer, Sipi Merit Oyebade aka SIPI has released another single entitled Oshofree. The newly released song is scheduled to be on her soon-to-be-released Extended Playlist (EP). According to Sipi, the latest track is to prove her ability to explore another sound other than her regular with the belief that fans would appreciate her more. “I’m a very diversified artiste. I tend to flow with whatever kind of music I’m given, I try as much not to limit my options and try to work with every sound.” The Delta-born singer and songwriter disclosed she grew up in Port-Harcourt and currently residing in Lagos to explore every given opportunity. The singer noted that her love for music started from childhood; however, she started recording and releasing songs in 2012. SIPI is one artist the industry needs to be on the lookout for.
