The metropolitan Archbishop of Enugu Anglican Province, Most Rev. Emmanuel Chukwuma, has described the extradition of leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu a good development to Igboland. Speaking with The Nation in Enugu, Archbishop Chukwuma, who accused the IPOB leader of not appreciating the people like Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe who secured bail for him, stated that with his extradition, the ongoing violence in the southeast would be highly reduced. His words: “I think his extradition is a good development which will bring a little bit of calm and peace to the boys he has been instigating and to Igboland so that we can have a peaceful atmosphere. “Nnamdi Kanu jumped bail. He did not appreciate Senator Abaribe and others who secured the bail for him. “Rather, when he was abroad, he was instigating people to cause confusion. We warned him severally to stop that. “It’s not only that, we felt that if you are a leader and you are part of the problem of Nigeria, you should come down here so we can discuss with others on how to solve the problem. “First of all, settle this case for which you jumped bail. “Let him face the music and then come out and let us know what his view about Biafra and agitation is. We will then do it with dialogue and peaceful instead of all this violence and killing which I totally condemn. We don’t want violence. We don’t want killings and destruction of our properties”. On the fears that Kanu might be eliminated in the process, Archbishop Chukwuma declared that would amount to looking for the trouble of the Igbo. “We will not allow him to be eliminated. Let him face his trial and judgement. They cannot eliminate anybody like that. If they eliminate him, then they are looking for more trouble,” he said.
