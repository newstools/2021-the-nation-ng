Two people were confirmed killed yesterday when men of the Oyo State Park Management System under the leadership of Mr Mukaila Lamidi (also known as Auxiliary) allegedly attacked some shop owners in the Iwo Road area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The attack on the shop owners was said to be in continuation of an earlier attack and a counterattack between the Auxilliary PMS boys and members of the proscribed National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) on Monday. The Monday attack was said to have resulted in the death of two persons, one from each of both camps. The incident happened around Oremeji-Agugu area of the capital city. The PMS boys stormed the Baba Onilu area of Iwo Road, attacking phone shops. They were said to have unleashed terror on the phone sellers and shop owners destroying kiosks and other structures, while also looting. One member of the NURTW was said to have been killed in the process while many others suffered varying degrees of injuries. A son of one of the shop owners, simply identified as Ahmed, was said to have been killed in an effort to identify those fomenting trouble in the property. Government functionaries reportedly tried to prevent escalation of the crisis. There was heavy security in parts pf the city amid loud sirens.
