Speaking with The Nation, Adelu said, “I had an altercation with one man called Sikoli Eleshe who wanted to fight me but I could  not overpower him. I took my gun and shot him. We keep our guns with one Tioja. Those guns were recovered from Yahoo boys during the EndSARS protests in Osogbo last year.” We are using those guns to maim people.” Similarly, Gbenga Tope, said, he was an ex-convict and he has killed two rival cultist members in 2021 after he left the prison.
