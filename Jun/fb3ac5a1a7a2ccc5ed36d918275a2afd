One of the kingmakers for the selection of a new Oba for Akunnu community in Akoko North-East Local Government, Mr. Olorunda Agoyi popularly known as Ewureni has slumped and died. His death stalled the selection process. The Oba of Akunnu died in 2019 but a new Oba could not be picked because there were only two surviving kingmakers in the community instead of eight. Late Agoyi was among the six kingmakers also known as Warrant Chiefs that were picked from six quarters in the community for the purpose of selecting a new Oba. Explaining how Agoyi died, an elder of the community, Babatunde Oluwaseun, dismissed reports that Agoyi was contesting to be Oba and that he died during the consultation of Ifa Oracle. Oluwaseun said that Agoyi might have been killed through diabolical means because he refused to do the bidding of some persons in the community. He said Agoyi slumped at a meeting and all efforts to revive him failed.
