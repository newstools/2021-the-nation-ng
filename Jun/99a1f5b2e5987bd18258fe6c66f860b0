Tokyo 2020- bound Elizabeth Anyanacho was yesterday edged to the silver in the women’s -67kg at the 2021 African Taekwondo Championships held in Dakar, Senegal. The 22-year-old  put up a good fight from the first fight against  Umurerwa Nagede and defeated  the Rwandan 24-1 to set up a semi-final clash against current African champion and Tokyo 2020-bound Hedaya Malek of Egypt. Anyanacho fought with caution and stunned the Rio Olympics bronze medalist Egyptian 6-5 in a close fight to berth in the final against  World Champion and Olympic medalist, Ruth Gbagbi of Cote d’Ivoire. The final bout against the Ivorian  might have served as a dress rehearsal for the Olympic Games as both fighters showed their dexterity to the admiration of the fans at the Dakar Arena. But  despite the excellent  display by the  Nigerian, it was the experienced Olympian that had an edge  with a 10-8 final result. “The match was very good for me and I was unlucky to have lost due to some technical errors which made me miss some points,” Anyanacho said. “However, I learnt from my experience because during the fight I was able to use my samba and 360 kicks which I have been practicing for a long. “I think with the way I fought I am gaining some confidence heading to Tokyo and whenever we meet again, I believe I will come victorious. This tournament was indeed a good experience for me as I got to meet some of my potential opponents at Tokyo,” Anyanacho noted.
