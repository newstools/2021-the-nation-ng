  German coach Gernot Rohr  has yet recounted  some of his best moments  since taken over the reins of the Super Eagles in 2016 as he marked  his  68th birthday anniversary   yesterday. Born June 28, 1953 in Mannheim (Germany),  Rohr is currently in Abuja in advisory capacity  to the  Super Eagles  Team B  coaching  crew  as they prepare  for Friday’s  international friendly match against Mexico at the  Los Angeles Coliseum in the State of California. The former Bayern Munich defender who was named Super Eagles  manager in August 2016, was in a boisterous  mood as he reinstated  his commitment to the cause  of the three-time  continental champions ahead of the forthcoming  Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Cameroon next year. “ Of course, the best moments in these last five years  were  qualifications for big tournaments ,” the former Bordeaux player and coach  recalled his wards qualification for  the  Russia 2018 World Cup  and 2019 AFCON in Egypt.“ There were big victories also especially the 4-0 win against Cameroon  and the victory against Algeria; as well as the interesting World Cup in Russia with the youngest team of the tournament  and the bronze medal win in Cairo  was also a good memory.”  Yet Rohr who previously had stints with Gabon, Niger and  Burkina Faso  before berthing in Nigeria, said  the Eagles cannot  afford to slip up in the coming months , adding he’s focus on qualification for Qatar 2020 World Cup as well as finishing on the high at the forthcoming AFCON. “My expectation now is to start well in the World Cup qualifiers and finish on top of our First Round   group  (Nigeria  is drawn against Liberia, Central African Republic and Cape Verde)  and qualify for the next round,” Rohr further told NationSport. “ Then there is the AFCON in Cameroon between January and  February next year  and  the World Cup qualification in March; so there are big matches s and sensations to come.” Since 2016, Rohr has played some  57 matches  with 31 wins; 15 draws and 11 losses  and has amassed an impressive 54.39 percentage across all competitions.
