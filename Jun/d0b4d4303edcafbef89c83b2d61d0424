Troops of the Defence Headquarters Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) stationed in the Southern Kaduna general area have averted an attack by armed bandits that would have led to loss of lives in Gidan Zaki, Zangon Kataf local government area. According to report, the bandits invaded farmlands in the village and destroyed maize crops with cutlasses. They vandalised the home of one Mr Joseph Aboi, a resident of the village. They also damaged a nearby vehicle before storming a phone charging shop belonging to one Benjamin Joseph, carting away phones and chargers. A statement by Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said investigation into the matter was ongoing. According to Aruwan, the swift response of the troops repelled the attack early on, as the bandits retreated from the area in disarray. “One Angelina Francis, a resident of the village, was injured by a bullet during the sporadic shooting by the bandits. She was evacuated to a nearby medical facility for treatment. “Governor Nasir El-Rufai noted the reports with sadness, while thanking the troops for their prompt response which halted the attack and prevented its escalation. He wished the injured resident a speedy recovery, and tasked security agencies with ensuring a thorough investigation. “Investigations into the incident are in progress,” Aruwan said.
