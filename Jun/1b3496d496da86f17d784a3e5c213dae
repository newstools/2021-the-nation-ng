Police in Ekiti have dismissed reports that heavily-armed bandits has arrived in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. Reports circulating in social media claimed that the bandits from the northern part of the country were camped at Shasha market in the capital city. But commissioner of police Tunde Mobayo waved the reports away, saying they were the handiwork of mischief makers bent on spreading false and misleading stories in order to cause panic among the people. Mobayo, in a statement by spokesman Sunday Abutu, urged the people to disregard the reports. “The story is not just false, but a lie from the pit of hell, fabricated and spread by the enemies of the society to cause unnecessary panic,” he said. “The Command wishes to state explicitly that on Tuesday, 8th June, 2021 at about 5pm a truck loaded with bags of beans, dried fish, onions and other food items from Sokoto State heading to Akure, Ondo State, stopped at Shasha Market Junction, Ado-Ekiti to offload five bags of fish. “In the process, they were accosted by Amotekun personnel and interrogated but were later cleared to offload the bags of fish and proceed with their journey after confirming that nothing incriminating as alleged was found with them. “More so, the said truck did not even enter Shasha Market, but only stopped at the Junction, and had earlier stopped at Ifaki-Ekiti where some bags of beans were offloaded. “The command hereby implores members of the public especially the good people of Ekiti State to disregard the unfounded rumour, as there is no iota of truth in it.” The Commissioner of Police said the command will continue to work with relevant bodies to ensure the safety of lives and property in the state. The Commissioner also warned against the spread of false alarms that are capable of causing apprehension in the society as anyone found wanting will be made to face the wrath of the law.
