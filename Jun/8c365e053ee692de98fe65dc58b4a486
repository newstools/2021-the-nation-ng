Judiciary workers in Rivers State have relaxed the ongoing nationwide strike action by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN). JUSUN National Office on April 6, 2021, directed its members to proceed on indefinite strike, following the failure of state governments to grant their financial autonomy demand. Leadership of the Union said there is no going back until their demands are met. The development led to the closure of all courts in Nigeria, including Supreme and Appeal courts. Litigants, lawyers and businesses around the courts have lamented hardship as the result of the situation. Governor Nyesom Wike has expressed fury on the participation of the state JUSUN in the strike, claiming that his administration is already implementing financial autonomy for the judiciary, stressing that the state workers are simply on sympathy strike in support of their colleagues in other states. He threatened to draw their salaries to implement the “no work no pay” policy from the month of June if they refuse to call off the strike and return to work. The Governor gave the threat during a public function in the state last week. By early hours of Monday, June 7, the state union, via a telephone call, directed their members to return to work the same day. When The Nation visited the courts yesterday, most of the workers were seen in their courts either doing cleanup of their offices, tables and seats, updating court registers and preparing cause lists in readiness for the resumption of sitting. However, no Magistrate or Judge was sighted in the premises, but some lawyers were around. Some JUSUN members who spoke to our reporter expressed delight returning to work after two months, saying that they were tired of staying at home. The Nation learnt that the outcome of the meeting of JUNSUN leadership and the government which is ongoing in Abuja as at the time of filing this report yesterday would determine whether or not the decision of Rivers chapter will be sustained.
