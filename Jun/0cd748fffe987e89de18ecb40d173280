Nollywood actor Uche Maduagwu has urged Davido to marry Chioma within the next 21 days if he wants God to expose the wickedness around him. The actor said this while reacting to the singer’s post where he asked God to expose all the wickedness around him. Davido has responded to a revelation by a Pastor that he will be poisoned by a close associate. Reacting, Davido said: “God will expose and deal with any wickedness around me near or far AMEN.. I am blessed.” But Maduagwu said there is no greater wickedness than promising a woman marriage, making her the queen of engagement rings, getting her pregnant, welcoming your child then abandoning her for public ridicule. The actor made reference to the state of his relationship with his estranged fiancée, Chioma. Sharing a photo of the “Gobe” crooner, the actor said: “Dear Davido, stop being stubborn like #Buhari, marry Chioma within 21 days if you want God to expose all the wickedness around you this new prophecy just came in now because of all the prayers Nigerians offered on your behalf. “There is no wickedness greater than promising a woman #marriage only to make am Lord of engagement ring, give am belle and after she born, you still no marry am, oga your 30BG wickedness dey choke.”
