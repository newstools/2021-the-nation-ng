Two persons have been confirmed dead with no fewer than 10 others injured in Ajaawa in Ogo-Oluwa local council of Oyo State. A police team allegedly from the command headquarters Abuja was blamed for the attack, which caused panic in the community. The invasion took place at midnight on Monday. The police team reportedly came in three Sienna buses. Addressing newsmen in Ibadan yesterday, chairman, Ogo Oluwa council, Seun Ojo, the traditional ruler of the community Alajaawa of Ajaawa, Oba Thompson Oyetunji and other leaders of the community said they confirmed that the police team registered their mission at the office of the Area Commander and with the Divisional Police Officer, Ajaawa. It was gathered that the police killed the person they came to arrest, and also killed another during their intermittent shooting. “Our people are at a loss as to why law enforcement officers would invade a community in such commando-like manner and unleash mayhem leading to a situation where members of the community had to take refuge in the forest in the dead of the night,” the community leaders said. They appealed to the Inspector General of Police for protection and action on the incident. The state police command was yet to release any statement on the matter at press time.
