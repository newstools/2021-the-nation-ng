A Non-governmental organisation, Academic Excellence Initiative (AEI) has handed over books won by Lutron College to the school authority in Lagos. Lutron College defeated other schools to clinch the 2021 Book Donation during the AEI Award/Scholars’ Day. Project Coordinator of AEI Prince Adesegun Ogungbayi said the donation of books to Secondary School was to augment government’s efforts. Ogungbayi urged parents to pay adequate attention to the need of their children. He hailed the school’s Proprietor, Oludele Adedeji for exposing the pupils to competitions. “Lutron College has done well in guiding their pupils against examination malpractices. The Principal of the College, Oluwasola Olujobi should also be commended for instilling confidence in the pupils. “The pupils should be more serious with their studies for them to achieve greater heights. They should cultivate the habit of reading regularly and not when test or examination is approaching. It won’t be easy for pupils to make outstanding grades if they are not studying daily or updating what they have been taught in the classes,” Ogungbayi said. Olujobi thanked AEI for coming up with such “brilliant initiative.” He promised the school will make good use of the books and continue to raise the bar of the pupils’ academic performance.
