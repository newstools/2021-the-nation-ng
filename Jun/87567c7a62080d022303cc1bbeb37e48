The Senate on Tuesday urged the Federal Government to immortalise former Chief of Army Staff, late Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, by naming a military structure in his honor. The upper chamber also observed a one-minute silence in honour of Attahiru and 10 other military personnel who lost their lives in the ill-fated plane crash that occurred two weeks ago in Kaduna. The Senate resolved to send a delegation to visit the families of the deceased. The resolutions of the upper chamber followed a point of order moved by Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, at plenary on the death of the former COAS and 10 others. Ndume said: “The Senate expresses shock over the death of the nation’s 21st Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 others in a plane crash in Kaduna on the 21st of May, 2021. “The Senate condoles with the Commander-In-Chief, families of the deceased, the Armed Forces and the Nigerian people over the unfortunate incident and that their death will not be in vain as they died in the line of duty and in the service of the fatherland. “The Senate further notes the patriotic and exemplary leadership of the late Chief of Army Staff as reflected in the brief period he held sway as the nation’s Army Chief.”
