Super Eagles star striker Victor Osimhen might be heading to England with words rive that new Tottenham football chief Fabrizio Paratici is lining up a Serie A striker raid. Paratici is reportedly studying options to replace unsettled centre-forward Harry Kane and to Italian tabloid, Gazzetta dello Sport claimed he has made initial enquiries after the Napoli ace striker. Napoli chiefs are aware of the contact being established between the player’s camp and Paratici. As such, Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis is actively discussing with fellow directors about the prospect of a contract upgrade for Osimhen. The striker’s deal runs to 2024, but a pay rise and the addition of a buyout clause would secure his future to Naples. In case Osimhen is not available, Tottenham are equally looking at Bundesliga strikers as a replacement for Harry Kane. High on the agenda according to BILD is Werder Bremen’s Dutch star Wout Weghorst, who has been on Spurs’ radar for 18 months. Towards the end of last season, Weghorst said: “If something big comes up, we have to listen to it.” Along with Weghorst, Paratici is also interested in VfB Stuttgart’s Sasa Kalajdzic, though his €30m price tag is regarded as too rich by Spurs.
