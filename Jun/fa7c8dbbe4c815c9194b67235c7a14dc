It is no longer news that the much-hyped instant messaging and financial transaction app, Crowwe, belonging to young businessman and former All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, was removed from Google Playstore for alleged policy violation. But there appears to be more turbulence down the road for the would-be tech executive. Barely 48 hours after the axe fell on Crowwe, Garba suffered another blow as his handle on the Facebook-owned social networking service, Instagram, was deleted last Wednesday. Sentry learnt the controversial politician’s travails may not be unconnected with the many face-offs he had over the Twitter ban by the Federal Government. An unrelenting defender of the ban, Garba’s is unsparing of people who oppose the ban and has been very strong in his condemnation of those dragging President Muhammadu Buhari over the matter. In one of his numerous arguments on Instagram, Garba said “Twitter as an “insurrectionist tool that has long ceased to be a social media platform of freedom of expression. Twitter is not a social media app. It is aiding and abetting Nnamdi Kanu and his terrorist IPOB commanders to be able to destroy the Nigerian space.” While it should be noted that Garba has been unrepentant with his hard stance against Twitter, which of course attracted a lot of backlash, it was gathered that multiple users may have reported him for violations and indiscretions.
