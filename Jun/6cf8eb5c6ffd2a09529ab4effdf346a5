Samsung Heavy Industries Nigeria has reached a significant health and safety milestone of 2,000 days with no lost time injuries (LTI) at its subsidiary SHI-MCI, Africa’s largest ship fabrication and integration yard located in Lagos. Its subsidiary SHI-MCI had in 2019, celebrated 1,200 days with no LTI. LTI is a HSE term which means “lost time injury”, which is an injury sustained by an employee that will lead to loss of productive work time. Even one minor incident will result in a complete reset of the LTIs counter to zero. The celebration of 2,000 days without LTI would not have been possible if any major injury was inflicted to employees. According to a statement by the company, it recorded the 2,000 days without LTI on June 4, 2021. This achievement, according to the company, was reflective of SHIN’s intense focus on ensuring the health and safety of its entire workforce through significant investment in training and oversight. The ship-building industry is potentially a very dangerous one with heavy machinery in operation, explosive gases used for welding and high temperatures in enclosed spaces. This means that there are many challenges to ensuring the health and safety of a large and diverse workforce. Commenting on the achievement, Senior Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Manager of Samsung Heavy Industries, Nigeria, Mr. Bala Adjuya, said one of the main focuses of the company is the health and safety of everyone. He said: “We prioritise the importance of our staff, partners and stakeholders getting home safely every day.”
