A 35-year old farmer identified as Kelvin Abugu has been arrested for defiling a nine-year-old girl. The offence was committed at Ogbese area of Akure North local government. It was the mother of the victim, Agnes Emmanuel, that raised the alarm after she saw her daughter passing out blood from her private part. The victim opened up that it was the suspect that inserted his hand and later his penis into her private part. Speaking while he was paraded at the Ondo State Police Command, Kelvin blamed his action on the devil. “It was the devil that pushed me. I am yet to get married. I have never slept with children before. There are many ways the devil can destroy somebody. “She always comes to my room to watch movies. Sometimes I will leave her there. “The day I have sex with her, she did not cry. I was feeling very bad. It was in my room I had sex with her. She left and later in the afternoon I saw some people who said people were looking for me.” Ondo Police Commissioner, Bolaji Salami, said the suspect would be charged to court when judicial workers called off their strike.
