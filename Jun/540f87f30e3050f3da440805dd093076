Chelsea have triggered the option to extend Thiago Silva and Olivier Giroud’s contracts at the club for a further year. The Brazil defender and France striker were both out of contract in the summer but the club have exercised their option to keep them at the club for another season. Earlier on Friday, the newly-crowned European champions announced they have also extended head coach Thomas Tuchel’s deal, with his new contract running through to June 2024. Silva, 36, joined on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain last summer and impressed in his first season at Stamford Bridge, featuring in 34 games across all competitions.  “We said when he signed that we hoped Thiago would add new trophies to his impressive list of honours, and he has done just that with our success in the Champions League this weekend. We now hope that he carries on in exactly the same fashion in the coming year.” Thiago has duly shown everyone at Chelsea his immense quality throughout this season, and he has had a huge influence on and off the pitch for us,” said Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. Meanwhile, Giroud had been touted for a Chelsea exit this summer with a number of clubs such as AC Milan manifesting an interest in signing the Frenchman as a free agent.
