Police Inspector Adewumi Abiola killed by kidnappers was on Wednesday laid to rest in his family home in Igbemo Ekiti, Irepodun/ Ifelodun Council Area of Ekiti State. Abiola was shot dead on June 16 by kidnappers while trying to protect the expatriates handling the Ogun/Oyo State railway Project from abduction at a site in Ogun State. The slain policeman body was brought from Ibadan by policemen. The late police officer was survived by an 80-year-old mother, Mrs Olubiyo Abiola, a young wife and four female children, who are still in  primary school. The slain policeman’s elder sister, Mrs Caroline Bamigboye said Abiola was buried quickly because over 20 bullets pierced his  body and were difficult to remove.
