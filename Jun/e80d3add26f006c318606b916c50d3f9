Manchester United stars could be at risk in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s summer revamp of his squad, sources have told ESPN. Enquiries made by agents and intermediaries over the availability of players like Anthony Martial and Donny van de Beek have been met with a response from the club that “every player has a realistic valuation.” Sources have told ESPN that realistic offers for squad players will be considered during the summer transfer window but that Solskjaer expects the bulk of his core group to stay. Van de Beek endured a difficult first season at Old Trafford following his £40 million move from Ajax but sources insist the midfielder is willing to fight for his place. The 24-year-old is on holiday after pulling out of the Netherlands squad for Euro 2020 because of injury. Martial has not featured since March after picking up a knee injury. Should he stay, he is likely to find increased competition for a place in Solskjaer’s team with United close to wrapping up a deal with Borussia Dortmund for winger Jadon Sancho. Remaining details like payment structure and bonuses are still to be ironed out but sources have told ESPN a problematic gap in valuation between the two clubs has mostly been overcome.
