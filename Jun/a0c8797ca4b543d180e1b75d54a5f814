Germany coach Joachim Low is expecting “a totally different” match against England after his side drew 2-2 with Hungary in their last Euro 2020 group game. Leon Goretzka’s late equaliser clinched Germany second place in Group F and a last-16 clash with old foe England at Wembley on Tuesday. Germany came from behind twice to avoid their second group defeat on a rollercoaster night in Munich, with substitute Goretzka firing home the all-important goal in the 84th minute. Low told a press conference: “Hungary parked the bus, with everyone behind the ball, entering every duel and against England it’s going to be a totally different match. “They play at home, they want to attack. It’s going to be an open match, more open than it was tonight. “We need to improve on things, we’re aware of that and we need to be careful, especially at set-pieces. We can’t repeat the same mistakes again. “But as I said, it’s a different match against England and we’re looking forward to it.” Adam Szalai’s early header gave Hungary a flying start and straight after Kai Havertz’s 66th-minute equaliser for Germany, Andreas Schafer headed the underdogs back in front. Low added: “This was the ‘group of death’ and we managed to achieve the second spot and now we travel to England. It’s great news to play in London at Wembley against England. “The group stage is over and now we have to focus. It’s in or out now, a good situation.”
