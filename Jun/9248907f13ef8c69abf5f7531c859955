Benson said: “Currently the issue of IDPs has taken centre in our lives. Today, insecurity has has extended it’s tentacles nationwide, nowhere is safe “Our image as a nation is being demeaned at an alarming rate. If we stay aloof, it is at our peril. We can no longer afford to sleep with our two eyes closed.” She further explained the foundation is working hard to complement the efforts of the government in terms of addressing issues of irregular migration and other refugee crisis. New BOT members of the foundation, including Ademola Oyinlola, Josephine Smith, Adebisi Kuforiji, Olugbenga Feyisitan, Margaret Ukegbu, others who spoke at the event, promised to contribute their quotas in carrying out the key mission of AREF.
