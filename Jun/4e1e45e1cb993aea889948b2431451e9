Diddy is the one who executively produced Burna Boy’s ‘Twice As Tall’ album that won him the ‘Best Global Music Album’ at the 63rd edition of the Grammy Awards. The Afrofusion star, who is currently in the US, paid a visit to his much senior colleague in the music industry, ‘Love’ and for the two, it was an extremely exciting experience seeing each other after a long time as COVID-19 restrictions affected flights during the production of his album in 2020. The two music giants could not hold back their emotions as they were greatly excited to see each other again. In the now viral video, the billionaire music executive producer, P Diddy said: “Today is a glorious day. Today I get reunited with my brother. I know we all back outside and everything but you know there was a time not too long ago, we were all trapped inside the house. And during this time, I gat to make a legendary album, executively produce a legendary album with my brother, Burna Boy. And I haven’t seen him.”
