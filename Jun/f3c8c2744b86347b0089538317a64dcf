Rector of the Federal College of Dental Technology and Therapy, Enugu (FEDCODTTEN), Dr. John Emaimo, was has been conferred with the Most Outstanding Rector of the Year Award in Nigeria by the Association of Southern Nigeria Students (ASONIS) The group said Emaimo’s selection followed an examination of the activities and profiles of various rectors that it received. President of ASONIS, Comrade Chinedu Edeh, said the decision to confer the award on Emaimo was taken by over 60 selected Southern Nigeria students’leaders from the three geo-political zones. “It is a tradition for ASONIS to choose people based on what they are doing and what they are capable of doing next, because from what one has done, we’ll be able to predict what he can do next. So many names were forwarded but Dr. Emaimo represents a father, a mentor and a great administrator because he has done so much for the Dental College. ASONIS picked him because of his good policies,” Edeh said. Emaimo said he did not know that people were watching and taking note of the trends in the college under his watch. He described the college as a student friendly institution where both academic and non-academic staff would not have been engaged if students were not there in the first instance. “This college has transited from awarding Higher Diplomas to the level of degree awards. This is the first federal degree awarding institution in Enugu State and in the future, it becomes only a degree awarding institution and the college is focusing on critical areas of need,” Emaimo added.
