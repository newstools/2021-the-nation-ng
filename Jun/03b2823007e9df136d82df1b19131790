Six Tiv farmers have been reported killed in Nasarawa State. President, Tiv Development Association (TIDA) Comrade Peter Ahemba said the farmers were killed by suspected herdsmen. Ahemba said the herders invaded Tse-Jimin village in Keana local government area on Saturday night. The TIDA president said a woman who survived the assault confirmed that Fulani herdsmen were the attackers. “My call to the government of Nasarawa State is to strengthen security in the state. This attack was unprovoked. They just came and attacked our people,” he said.
