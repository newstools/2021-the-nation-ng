Uneasy calm, on Monday, pervaded the atmosphere in some parts of Igangan Community in Oyo State, as security was heightened owing to last Saturday’s violent attack. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Igangan, one of the seven towns that make up Ibarapa land, is in Ibarapa North Local Government area of the state. NAN Correspondents, who attempted to visit Igangan for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation on Monday, were unable to get to the town, as they were turned back by irate youths at Idere. As at 2.15 pm., the youths had already taken over the major road leading to the town, brandishing dangerous weapons, such as locally-made guns, cutlasses and charms, among others. NAN reports that there were no fewer than 17 blockages mounted by the irate youths on the road between Eruwa and Idere, a stretch of about 25 kilometres. It was also observed that public institutions, schools, banks and local government offices, among others, in almost all the towns visited were under lock and key. At each of the road blockages, the youth were seen enforcing proper identification of every individual and vehicle before being allowed to pass. NAN also reports that the youth were visibly angered by the Saturday night attack which led to killing and destruction of property in Igangan. When it was getting harder for NAN team to proceed on the journey, a security personnel, who pleaded anonymity, advised the journalists to make a detour to avoid being caught in the web in the trouble spot. “You guys have to be very careful, because those youths are very very angry and they can do anything to anybody. I wish you well,” he said.
