 The governor of Osun State, Adegboyega Oyetola has warned that his administration will not give room for criminals in the state, irrespective of social status. Oyetola, issued the warning during his meeting with Non-Indigenous Communities including the Hausa, Igbo, Tivs, Ebira, Igede, Igala and Fulani resident at Osogbo held at Adenle Grammar School Ayetoro Osogbo, the state capital. The governor, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, charged residents to abide by the laws and orders, as the government would not condone any erring individual or group irrespective of social, religious and ethnic consideration. Oyetola said peaceful coexistence has been fostered by his administration’s continuous engagement with all social strata, including the non-indigenous communities.  “Although no society is free of crime the combination of our policy frameworks of engagement and the cooperation of all non-indigenous communities has been the source of our strength in managing the issues and nipping them at the bud. “The state of Osun treats all with fairness, justice and inclusiveness without giving prejudice to social, religious and ethnic consideration, thereby making both the aborigines and the non-indigenes to be seen as stakeholders in policy formulation in the state governance process,” Oyetola said. In his remark, the Senator representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Ajibola Basiru appreciated the non-indigenous communities for their unwavering support for the current administration, emphasising that the program was necessary for maintaining the peace and stability the state currently enjoins. Ajibola who doubles as the senate spokesperson also underscored the importance of continuous engagement as only a virile means of managing series of ethnic challenges as well as sustaining peaceful coexistence in the country.
