The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) ministerial task force on traffic management has condemned the attempt by a truck driver, Wilson Aniete, to kill the ‘Truck Timing Unit Head’ of the Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTD) on the Kugbo stretch of the Abuja-Keffi Road. The driver of the truck had at the weekend rammed into Mr. Udunobun Otaigbe, popularly referred to as ‘Santos’ while on official duty. While the official was leading his men to stop trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles from plying the road during rush hour, he was knocked down by the truck driver near Karu Bridge. The truck was initially flagged down and parked by the roadside, but in an attempt to escape, the truck driver started the vehicle and ran into the senior officer. While some of his men struggled to rescue him, others chased the fleeing driver, who was soon apprehended. The injured official is receiving treatment.
