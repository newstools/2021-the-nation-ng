Green Africa Airways has completed the acceptance of three ATR 72-600s from ACIA Aero Leasing as required by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) for a new airline to hold an Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC) to  begin commercial flights. AOC is a mandatory requirement before any airline can commence commercial operations. In a statement, its spokesperson,  Oyinade Osobajo said the third aircraft with registration ZS-XZC /5N-GAD arrived in Lagos last Thursday. She said amid  the pandemic-induced market disruption, Green Africa  has laid out a roadmap for market entry by deploying ACIA’s ATR aircraft to deliver affordable, short-haul connectivity between Nigerian cities to stimulate the region’s development and business activity. Also, Green Africa Airways founder and Chief Executive Officer, Babawande Afolabi, said: “Receiving our third aircraft  signifies Green Africa’s readiness to enter into service and start serving our customers. ACIA Aero Leasing has been a very supportive partner and we are proud of this relationship.” ACIA Aero Leasing Chief Executive Officer Mick Mooney, also said: “We are thrilled to have partnered with Green Africa’s experienced manage ment team to get their airline off the ground while supporting their ambitious mission to use the power of air travel to create a better future for customers and other key stakeholders.” The value carrier recently launched ticket sales on greenafrica.com with flights as low as N16,500 and a ‘gFlyer Special Offer’ which takes 10 per cent  off the first booking of gFlyer Community members.
