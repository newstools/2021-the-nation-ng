Ex-BBNaija housemate, Ka3na has revealed why she unfollowed most housemates on social media during last night’s edition of the Reunion show. Ka3na, while speaking during the sixth episode, opined that she was unable to bond with the Housemates because of the little time she spent in the house. The ‘Boss Lady’ noted that she was grossly offended by the utterances from some housemates after her eviction from the show. As a result, this made her unfollow almost everyone of them on social media. She said: “I didn’t have enough time to bond with the housemates before I was evicted and the comments I heard when I was out of the house from the housemates was the reason I unfollowed almost everyone. “Also, I unfollowed most of the housemates because of what they thought about me.” Tolanibaj however, opposed her reason, insinuating that Ka3na unfollowed most of them because they attended Nengi’s birthday party. Ka3na and Lilo were the first housemates to be evicted from the Lockdown edition.
