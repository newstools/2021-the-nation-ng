Residents of Ifon community, headquarters of Ose local government area have cried out over incessant attacks by armed robbers and kidnappers in the community. They said their biggest worry was that security operatives in the area appeared helpless. They said the Police Divisional Headquarters, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the Amotekun Corps in Ifon office have no functional patrol vehicles and other logistics to fight crime in the area. Speaking after an emergency meeting, Coordinator of Ifon Progressive Minds, Olaniyi Eni-Olotu, said there was little or no response to distress calls from security agents in the locality. Olotu said last week’s killing of Dele Isibor, the All Progressives Congress (APC) Secretary for Ose Local Government and the kidnapping of four persons heightened their fears. Olotu said it was worrisome that criminals operate freely in the locality. He said the community was yet to recover from the killing of late monarch of Ifon, Oba Israel Adeusi at a time Isibor was killed. Olotu stated that the influx of the heavily-armed men from other neighbouring states into the forest reserves and farmlands in Ifon and environs was making life miserable for farmers and the inhabitants of the area. The armed men were said to be terrorising the area and responsible for the kidnapping and armed robberies occurring in the community lately. He said, “It is so sad to note that the Police Divisional Headquarters in Ifon as well as the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ifon office have no functional patrol vehicles which constitutes a major challenge for the security agencies in doing their job effectively and efficiently. “We plead for special consideration to be given to Ifon indigenes for recruitment into the Amotekun Corps, as they are more familiar with the terrain and will work more to fight insecurity confronting the area.”
