EVERTON are hopeful of confirming Rafael Benitez as Carlo Ancelotti’s successor within days. Former Liverpool manager Benitez, 61, has held several rounds of negotiations with Everton owner Farhad Moshiri and the club’s decision makers over the last two weeks. The Spaniard has impressed enough for them to ignore a mixed reaction from their fanbase to his proposed arrival. Ancelotti resigned in early June to return to Real Madrid Benitez’s arrival would be a contentious and controversial one as many Everton fans remain opposed to him after he described them as a “small club” following a goalless Merseyside derby at Anfield in February 2007. The Spaniard later admitted he had made a mistake, saying he was referring to the defensive approach of David Moyes’ team in that particular game rather than Everton as a club.
