 Robbers are reinventing themselves and redefining their methods. About 20 of them armed with assorted weapons and Point of Sale (POS) machines stormed an estate in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, and robbed many residents of millions of naira and other items. Some of the victims told The Nation that the hoodlums invaded their residence on Sunday about 11pm, going from house to house and from flat to flat. Six persons were injured, they said, while phones, laptops and huge amounts of cash were carted away by the assailants, after operating for about three hours. The residents said the robbers attacked the estate two weeks earlier before returning with POS machines. The hoodlums took away cash and also forced their victims to provide their Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards and Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) with they withdrew cash.  Where the withdrawal failed, the rogues went away with the ATM cards. Two weeks ago, the assailants robbed a Superintendent of Police. The robbers, it was gathered, gained entry into the estate through the recently dredged canal linking Barika, Agbowo, and Orogun. Accordingly to the residents, the robbers, armed with machete, guns and other dangerous weapons, divided themselves into groups, going from one flat to another. It was gathered that, no fewer than twenty families were robbed, some suffering machete cuts. A victim who pleaded anonymity said, “At House 31, where at least 12 flats were robbed, the robbers forced residents to use the POS which they brought but when network failed the transfer, they obtained the PIN and went away with the ATM cards.” Police eventually came amid sirens and gunshots, forcing the robbers to flee. Spokesman neither took his phone calls nor responded to text message the reporter sent to him.
