Minister, Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo said the ministry will continue to drive the growth of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) through providing access to finance, access to markets and reduction in the cost of operations. Adebayo who spoke during the National discourse on MSMEs in Abuja with the theme, ‘Little Beginnings; Huge Impact’ has called for suggestions on strategies for accelerating growth and ensuring sustainability of MSMEs. The Minister said the ministry has been supporting initiatives at enhancing the growth of MSMEs in the country, adding that the ministry will also provide support initiatives to enhance the growth of MSMEs, as they are a key foundation for productivity enhancement and inclusive growth in the Nigeria economy through their drive, ambition, and appetite for risk-taking and innovation. According to him, “It is gratifying to note that MSMEs in Nigeria are steadily intensifying their participation in leading-edge areas including FinTech, Logistics, Digital marketing, Food Aggregation and processing, and so on. This is in addition to the millions of players bringing their entrepreneurial energy to move traditional, but nevertheless critical sectors of the economy”.
