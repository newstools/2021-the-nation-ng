A joint security team on Tuesday dismantled a camp allegedly belonging to the Eastern Security Network (ESN) in Imo State. It was gathered that the team, led by Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abba Kyari, set ablaze buildings in the camp located in Akabo, Ikeduru Local Government Area. According to security sources privy to the operation, a policewoman who was held captive by the ESN was rescued from the camp. Our correspondent gathered that some suspects were arrested. The ESN, the security arm of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), has been accused of being responsible for the killing of security operatives and attacks on public facilities. But IPOB has repeatedly denied the allegations, insisting it had no hand in the vicious attacks by “unknown gunmen” and that it remained non-violent.
