The police described the news as fake. A statement by the Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Yusuf Mariam said: “The Command wants to state categorically that there is no record of such incident as at *2000hrs of Tuesday 15th June,2021* in the FCT. “However, the Command enjoins members of the public to cooperate *with the Police and other security agencies by providing prompt and useful information rather than circulate messages capable of causing undue panic amongst the well-spirited residents of the FCT. “On this note, we wish to reaffirm our resolve towards the provision of adequate security within the Federal Capital Territory”. The police further implored residents to report all suspicious movements, emergency or distress.
