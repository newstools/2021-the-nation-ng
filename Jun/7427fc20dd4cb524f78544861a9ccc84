Serena Williams edged a little closer to a record-equalling 24th  Grand Slam title with a battling three-set win over 174th-ranked Mihaela Buzarnescu of Romania yesterday  and declared: “That was kind of fun”. The 39-year-old Williams, a three-time champion in Paris, won 6-3, 5-7, 6-1 and will face fellow American Danielle Collins for a place in the last 16. Williams, seeded seventh, has been one short of Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 majors since winning the Australian Open in 2017.
