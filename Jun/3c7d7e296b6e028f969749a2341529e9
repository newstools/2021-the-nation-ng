Ex-housemate of the BBNaija Lockdown, Ka3na has confessed to having sex with fellow housemate, Praise, while in the BBNaija Lockdown house. Ka3na opened up on her sexual act with Praise after the show host, Ebuka, inquired what happened between her, Lucy and Praise. Ka3na said: “In the house, I had a conversation with him saying I’m drawn to you because I feel we are in the same cycle. I am separated from my partner and you are in a relationship and we don’t want much from ourselves if we want to do something but Dorathy and Lucy during a conversation with me told me that Praise said he was in the house for the game and he noticed that I like him but he can never and ever have anything to do with me,” she began. Continuing, Ka3na said: “I pulled Praise to my bed and had sex with him. I made sure it didn’t happen on his bed. So, I pulled him to my bed and had sex with him and he didn’t last five seconds. “I left him in my bed and went over to the sitting room to chill. Of course, people that watched saw everything, the aggressive cuddling and all stuff and after the house he felt he didn’t perform well enough and needed to prove himself to me in my room. Ozo was in my room and he waited till Ozo left the room and I still had sex with him and still didn’t last long.” Ka3na’s confession is coming after Dorathy admitted to getting engaged in oral sex with Bright O while in the house. Dorathy also said she felt it was a thing of the moment and an infatuation.
