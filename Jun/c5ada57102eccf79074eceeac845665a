Controversial Nollywood actor, Uche Maduagwu has claimed multiple award-winning singer, Davido, never bought a Rolls Royce. He accused Davido of flaunting a Rolls Royce he didn’t buy on social media. He said the Rolls Royce belongs to the singer’s billionaire father. Maduagwu added the “Gobe” singer had also flaunted one of his father’s private jets, claiming it was his. The actor assured if the Rolls Royce Cullinan and private jet belong to the 30BG boss, he is willing to leave the movie industry and even Nigeria. Uche Maduagwu said: “I am saying it again, if Davido come out talk say na him buy that Rolls Royce, I go comot for Naija. I go comot for Nollywood. No be the same person wey come out talk say him buy private jet, we come find out say na him papa get am.” Maduagwu, who shared a video of himself talking alongside Davido’s photos posed with the private jet and Rolls Royce captioned it: “Na zuzu no make am get the boldness to talk sey e buy RollsRoyce oga only put RR, because e no sey truth go come out, so d tori na sey his papa allegedly bought two brand new cars and one of dem na this and as usual Davido rush to post am like e did to the privatejet.
