The Eleda of Eda-Ile in Ekiti East Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Oba Benjamin Osho, who was abducted by gunmen last week, has regained his freedom. The traditional ruler was abducted while working in his farm in the community last Thursday and whisked away to an unknown destination. The kidnappers had earlier demanded N20 million ransom, which the family said it was on the high side and pleaded for it to be reduced. An impeccable source in the palace told reporters that Oba Osho was released late on Sunday night at a bush in one of the neighbouring communities. “Yes, Kabiyesi has been freed on Sunday night by the gunmen after the family paid about N2 million from the N20 million initially demanded by the gunmen. The money was raised from many people and I have someone who contributed to it. “As I speak with you now, he is receiving medical attention at a popular private hospital in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital,” he said. The state police spokesman, ASP Sunday Abutu, confirmed the release of the traditional ruler after manhunt from officers of the command. Abutu, who revealed that the monarch was dropped at a forest between Ode-Ekiti and Agbado Ekiti in Gbonyin Local Government Area of the state, however, denied knowledge of payment of any ransom.
