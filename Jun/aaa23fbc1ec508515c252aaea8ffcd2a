For the umpteenth time, Bayelsa State government has restated that it will not condone shoddy jobs in the various completed and ongoing projects in the state. The government, therefore, cautioned contractors handling road and other projects in the state to ensure that all projects are executed in accordance with professional standards and job specifications. The Chairman, Bayelsa State Directorate for Project Monitoring and Evaluation, Engineer Ebiye Tarabina, made these known yesterday after the inspection of completed and ongoing constituency projects in the state. Tarabina explained that the Douye Diri administration was fully committed to providing infrastructural development to change the narratives in the state. He also commended members of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly for initiating the constituency projects, saying that when completed, they would improve the socio-economic activities in the rural areas. He urged the communities where the projects are sited to appreciate the governmentâ€™s kind gesture by cooperating with the contractors as well as protecting the facilities for the good of all. Tarabina said some of the completed and ongoing constituency projects his team had inspected were landing jetty, access road at Sangana; rigid concrete pavement at Bekekiri; rigid concrete pavement at Twon-Brass and rigid concrete pavement at Egweama, all in Brass Local Government Area.
