There was panic at Ogbunabali area of Port Harcourt on Wednesday evening as gunmen drove around the place on a mini bus shooting intermittently. A source, who witnessed the incident, said it could not be confirmed what brought the gunmen to the area but that their action sent people running in different directions for safety. The source said: “Many drivers abandoned their vehicles and ran away, while others reversed to where they were coming from. The whole confusion caused serious traffic congestion on all adjoining roads in the area including the Port Harcourt – Aba Expressway around the Garrison Flyover. “At one point point, the gunmen got down from their bus off the main Ogbunabali Street to try to clear the traffic, but had to turn back after they could not wade through the maze of abandoned vehicles”. Governor Nyesom Wike, on Tuesday, commissioned the the dualisation of Ogbunabali Road to join the Old GRA part of the city. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni promised to verify the incident.
