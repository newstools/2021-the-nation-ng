Two hunters have shot six persons at a burial ceremony in Edo State. John Ebatame and Moses Okoyomon reportedly fired at the six persons during a faceoff with some locals who complained that one of the hunters shot and destroyed an electricity cable in the community. Police spokesman Bello Kontongs said in a statement yesterday that the incident happened over the weekend, and that the two hunters have been taken into custody. One of the hunters, Ebatame, “fired gunshots into the air, which resulted in the cutting of Ama community’s electricity cable. The youths of Ama confronted him immediately. In the course of argument, John threatened to shoot them, which he eventually did, injuring five male persons,” Kotongs said. The injured were being treated, he said.
