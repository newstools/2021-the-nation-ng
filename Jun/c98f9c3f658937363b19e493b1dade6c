Son of the General Overseer of Gospel Faith Mission International (GOFAMINT) Pastor Emmanuel Folorunso Abina, who died last month, has been buried amid tributes. Pastor Abina, who was head of media, and member of the church executive council, was interred at the Ogunmakin, Ogun State church cemetery at the weekend. Members of his family and the church paid tribute at a ceremony preceding the interment. Ronia, one of his four children, said his father taught them to be strong and to be prayer warriors. Former Southwest zonal chairman of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) Reverend Reuben Oke said Abina “finished well and accomplished God’s purpose for him within a short time.” Deputy General Overseer Pastor Emmanuel Oluwayemi said Pastor Abina would be “missed for his innovative and creative way of running the church, and his passion for the work of God”. Members of the English department of Lagos State University (LASU) said Abina had a knack for studying beyond his area of specialisation. “Folorunso will stay in the library of computer studies to read books and do some practical work even though he was studying English language,” one of them he said.
