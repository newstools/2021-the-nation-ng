French club Bordeaux have informed Premier League clubs that Fulham loan striker Josh Maja is available this summer at what could prove to be a bargain price. The 22-year-old striker spent the latter half of last season on loan with Scott Parker’s side, scoring three goals in 15 appearances, many of which came from the bench. Fulham did have an option to buy the Nigerian international upon the end of their loan agreement with the price set at €12m. However, with relegation confirmed, they have opted against that, returning him to a Bordeaux who are keen to raise funds with his sale. Speaking to French outlet Sud-Ouest this week, Bordeaux’s sporting director Alain Roche revealed that Maja is now available to other Premier League clubs, some of which have identified an interest in signing him. It comes after Ralph Hasenhuttl told HampshireLive that Southampton would be keeping their eyes open this summer for previously unexpected opportunities to sign a striker who can offer competition and support to Danny Ings and Che Adams. A move Maja looks likely to fall within Saints’ price range and, given recent post-Brexit work permit issues, he would not be required to seek the right to work in the UK.
