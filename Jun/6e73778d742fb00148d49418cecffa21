Delta Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has appealed to the residents of Warri, Effurun and environs to be patient owing to the flooding currently being recorded in the areas. Okowa made the appeal in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, in Asaba on Monday. He said his government had intensified efforts in tackling the flooding problem being experienced in the area. According to Okowa, contract for storm drainage projects to address the flood menace in the area has since been awarded and work is progressively ongoing. He said the projects were in three phases and that work was speedily ongoing on two major phases which were expected to be completed in 24 months. Okowa disclosed that at the weekend, the contractor and officials of Warri-Uwvie and Environs Development Agency, had worked assiduously on measures to check the level of flooding occasioned by the rainfall in the area. He noted that at the completion of the project, it would provide an enduring solution to the problem. Okowa, however, expressed optimism that before the year’s dry season, residents of the areas would begin to enjoy respite from flood as it would have been drastically checked by the Storm Drainage projects. The governor appealed to them to be patient with the government on the Storm Drainage scheme targeted at making flooding in the area a thing of the past. He commended the people for their cooperation and urged them to continue to support the state government in its drive toward attainment of a “Stronger Delta” agenda.
