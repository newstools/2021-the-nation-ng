The Ondo State Police Command has arrested one Emmanuel Joseph aged 35 who allegedly raped an 80-year old woman in Ondo state. Emmanuel was alleged to have gained entry into her room through a window at Lotogbe street, Ondo West Local Government Area, threatened her with a dagger and raped her. Sources said he collected her phone and money. Another source said the suspect entered the victim’s room with the pretence of collecting some herbs at the back of the house. The source who gave her name as Julianah Owolabi said it was the cry of the victim that attracted the attention of people who broke the door opened and caught the suspect naked. Owolabi said the suspect has been using dangerous weapons to rob people in the area. It was learnt that the children of the victim have relocated their mother from the area because of embarrassment. The suspect who asked his victims to forgive him said he was just released from prison. He said, “Please, forgive me. I don’t know what l am doing at that time. Something will tell me to steal or rape and I will do it. After that, I will be blaming myself for doing it. “I don’t know what has come over me. I was just released from prison before the strike because of this bad behavior. I have been doing it for a long. Please, forgive me,” he pleaded. Police sources said the suspect confessed to the crime while different phones, charms and dagger were recovered from his house. Ondo Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, could not be reached for comments.
