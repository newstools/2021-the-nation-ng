Japan’s tennis player Naomi Osaka has withdrawn from the French Open following the bitter fallout from her decision to boycott all media activity. On Sunday, the former world number one was warned she could be thrown out of the French Open if she continues to boycott post-match news conferences at the tournament. “The best thing for the tournament, the other players and my well-being is that I withdraw so that everyone can get back to focusing on the tennis going on in Paris,” the world number two wrote on Twitter yesterday. She was also fined $15,000 by Grand Slam organisers for failing to attend a news conference following her first-round win. Earlier this week, the four-time Grand Slam champion said she would not face the press during the French Open, citing mental health reasons. “I’ve often felt that people have no regard for athletes’ mental health and this rings very true whenever I see a press conference or partake in one,” she said last week.
