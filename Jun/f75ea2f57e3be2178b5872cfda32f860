SOULFUL singer Omawumi Megbele has opened up on why she shunned marriage for four years after the birth of her first child. The 39-year-old singer during a television interview said she preferred to be a single mother but the father of her child, Tosin Yusuf, chose to marry her and make her his wife. According to the mother of one, she decided to resist marriage after the birth of their daughter until she was certain they were both ready for marriage. “I was a baby mama for four years before Papa Kamila decided to marry me. I don’t know why. Because I had decided I don’t want to marry until we are good and ready. I take care of my baby and she’s going to be 10 years old on the 17th of this month,” she said. When asked if it was morally right for a woman to decide to have kids without being married, the 2007 West Africa Idols runner-up said it is better if a woman has the resources to look after a child. “My opinion is that if you are a good woman and you have the resources to look after your child, why not? Because, if you say you are factoring in mummy and daddy’s relationship, what if daddy is abusive? What if he’s a deadbeat? What if daddy is coming to be another child that you did not give birth to? “Right now, I encourage women that whatever brings you happiness and joy, carry on with it. Nobody is qualified to tell you what is right or wrong. At my age, I don’t care about anybody’s validation because God has been faithful to me and my family- so I don’t have to make noise inside the music industry again – and that motivated my new song entitled, Bullshit (BS).”
