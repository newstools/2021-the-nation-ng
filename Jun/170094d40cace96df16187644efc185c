When you think of a woman who would always defend children against the invasion of the proverbial hungry hawk, Senator Daisy Danjuma comes to the mind most especially for the role she played in the protection of children as the Chairman ECOWAS Parliament’s Women and Children’s Rights Committee and Senate Committee Chairman on Women Affairs and Youth Development at the senate. She was fierce, outspoken, intelligent, and glamorous. In a few months, she will turn 65, it can be said that being advanced in age has not taken a toll on her beauty as she is gliding to the septuagenarian club with such impeccable finesse. Interestingly, Danjuma, the Executive Vice Chairman, South Atlantic Petroleum, who still commands deep respect from young and old, tells whoever cares to listen that she is still in tune with the modern trends in the fashion world. She is a showstopper any day, any time. Danjuma, a Law graduate of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, began her career as a State Counsel in the Lagos State Ministry of Justice (Department of Public Prosecutions). Her numerous political followers and her admirers are quite worried about why she has recoiled into her shell leaving the social scene. She rarely attends social events again even before COVID-19, and she has slowed down on her public appearance. Sources said she is taking things easy. ‘She has attended enough social events in the past it’s time to retire and channel that energy on some other productive things. She spends more time at her home facing business and other things. She might celebrate her 69th birthday in August. If she does not because of the pandemic, she will be throwing a grand soiree when she clocks 70 next year. She is not silent, she just channeled her energy into other things.’
