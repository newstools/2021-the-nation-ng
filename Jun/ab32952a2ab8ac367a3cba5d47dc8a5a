A student of the Abia State University (ABSU), Uturu, simply identified as Francis Chibuike has reportedly died after jumping from a three-storey building. Chibuike, an Indigene of Imo State and 400 level Optometry student of the Abia State-Owned institution was said to have carried out the act under the influence of a suspected hard drug which he had reportedly taken moments before the incident. He was said to have died on the spot in front of his residence, a private lodge outside the campus. Unconfirmed reports have it that the deceased in the company of his friends took a hard drug they named as “Colorado”, but Chibuike who it cannot be immediately ascertained if it was his first time of consuming such drug, was unable to cope with the adverse effect of the drug on him. The Nation gathered that when the effect of the drug overwhelmed him, his friends who were around were said to have locked him inside the room in search of ‘garri’ to give him as a tranquilizer. The deceased, before the friends could make a return with the garri, reportedly gained access to the balcony and jumped down from the third floor of the lodge to the ground and died instantly. A security officer attached to the institution, who confirmed the incident to journalists, described it as one of the regrettable consequences of hard drugs. According to him, the deceased student drugged himself and told his friends that he was going out only for him to jump out from the window. He said he was immediately rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed dead. The security officer said that the parents of the student had already come to identify him and carried the corpse after meeting with the police. When contacted, state command police public relations officer (PPRO), SP Geoffrey Ogbonna said although he heard about the incident, he has not received any official report.
