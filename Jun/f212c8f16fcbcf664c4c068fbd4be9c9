Coscharis Motors Plc will showcase Ford, Ford Truck and Renault brands in this years’ Lagos Auto Fair scheduled to commence today at the Federal Palace Hotel, Victoria Island. Coscharis will also unveil the new Ford Explorer, which is the Ford Flagship in Nigeria. Coscharis Group General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Abiona Babarinde, said: “For the first time, as the exclusive distributors of these great brands in Nigeria, we are excited to showcase the locally-assembled Renault brands, the new Ford Trucks lines and also keen to reveal the latest model of the Ford Explorer. “In addition, the auto fair will be an opportunity to bring these vehicles closer to our customers and prospects alike that have been unable to visit our dealerships recently to avail them the newer models in our custody. More importantly is to equally make the purchase of any of our brands on display with the introduction of our finance scheme packages through our select finance partner platforms. These are some of the highlights of our participation this time around amongst other offerings to delight our numerous stakeholders to continually deliver value for their money.”
