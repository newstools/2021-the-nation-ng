Music executive Don Jazzy has slammed Twitter Users who are diligent in reposting his sexual tweets but are always reluctant to tweet about artists’ work. The producer, who has been promoting his artist, Ladipoe’s new song, ‘Feeling’, took to Twitter to call out fans who have been silent about the jam. In his tweet, Don Jazzy remarked that Nigerians are always eager to post about artists sexual desires but will never repost their new songs. According to him, if he were to tweet about his sexual fantasies or make reference to something vulgar or stupid, they would eagerly retweet his post. He tweeted: “If you see me tweet I just want to eat onome’s pussy now now. Or something stupid Na that one una Dey retweet. RT people’s hustle. Thanks.” The Mavin Records boss further advised fans to be supportive of artists’ hustle by helping them retweet their tweet maybe not all the time. He noted that the few times people render such support to an artist, it does make a difference as anyone can be in need of assistance at some point in time of their life. He tweeted: “Retweets are free. Somebody is hustling on your page. I’m not saying all the time. But sometimes just RT and move on. The support goes a long way and we appreciate. One day it could be your turn.”
