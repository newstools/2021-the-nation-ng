UberX Hourly is now available in Nigeria, giving riders an option of requesting a driver by the hour as they complete essential errands or deliveries during this period. Uber Hourly is an alternative to on-demand, point-to-point trips that allows riders to book a driver-partner and car by the hour to help get all their essential travel done in one go. Hourly will also provide riders with added convenience with no need to re-book their ride. From a trip to the office to the pharmacy, or supermarket, this new option is designed to give riders peace of mind. Through the Uber app, not only are riders able to access safe trips, but new income opportunities are also unlocked for drivers by providing more avenues for meaningful economic opportunities, while representing innovation in the transport sector. Uber’s Country Manager for Nigeria Tope Akinwumi said: “At our Global Go Get global consumer virtual event, we announced that this product would be available in Nigeria in the coming months, and we are proud to have kept our promise. We are excited to bring innovations designed to help people get anywhere and get anything as cities start to move again, while we continue to ensure that riders and businesses no longer have to navigate to multiple locations. Uber is continuously looking for ways to improve the experience for their communities and this is just the start! ’’ Uber, he said, will continue to leverage its technology to quickly adapt and meet the changing needs of businesses and customers, wherever they are. “Uber’s responsibility doesn’t end at merely providing this service and have kept safety in mind by providing relevant health information with drivers to ensure they are well-trained in COVID-19 related safety protocols and have been provided with hand sanitisers for use during trips,” Akinwumi said.
