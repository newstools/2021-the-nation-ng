Ifeanyi Cecil Kalu has risen to Eedris Abdulkareem’s defense saying many people who say untrue things about him don’t know the ‘JagaJaga’ rapper. In a chat with The Nation, Cecil said, “Many people talk trash about Eedris when they do not know him. If you don’t know people, don’t say jack.” The Pennsylvania-based singer hinted that he’s working with Eedris on the remake of his current single, ‘I am Africa,’ and has learned so much from him musically and as a person. “The song is a remix actually, but the original is out there. I am doing the remix with my brother, Eedris Abdulkareem who has taught me a lot in just a little while.” Cecil also revealed the reason behind his decision to do a song on reawakening the essence of being an African. “This is the first time I am doing something unique. I started a project I call, ‘I am Africa, Introduction 101.’ I am simply Introducing Africa back to the world. I live in Pennsylvania. I discovered that even in Pennsylvania, some old white folks do not know where New York is. When you mention Africa so many of them say Africa is a nation. Africa is not a nation but a continent. But I found out that it is not about them but us. We do not know who we are. This awakening is to bring the realization to know who we are. If we and our leaders in Africa understand who we are then the change has come. Our black brothers in America are suffering for ages and it is because we the blacks do not know who we are. The day we understand the power we have, we would stand firm and the world would respect and love us,” Cecil said.
