Some Kano residents have commended the Federal government for setting up the National Senior citizens Centre in the country. They gave the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday. A retired Civil Servant, Dr Ahmed Musa, said that the establishment of the centre was long overdue. Musa noted that many countries across the world honour their senior citizens through activities provided by such centre. “Some people retire and become a burden to their children and families due to poverty and absence of such a centre in our country.’’ Another retired Civil servant, Mr Felix Tukumi, commended the Buhari administration, saying that the centre would change the fate of many senior citizens. “Based on what we heard on the creation of the centre, I am sure that the administration means well for the aged as many families will be relieved,’’ Tukumi said. Also, Mr Umar Abdulaziz noted that the centre would provide support for senior citizens that lack proper care. “We have been hearing of such centres in other countries, it is a good thing that it has been introduced here. We commend the Federal Government for this,’’ he said. President Muhammadu Buhari had on May 31, approved the take-off of the national senior citizens’ centre. The President also approved the constitution of 12-member board for the centre with effect, according to a statement by Mr Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity. The centre was set up in line with Section 16 (2) (d) of the 1999 Constitution as amended. It is to provide adequate social services and improve the quality of life of the elderly. The National senior citizens centre Bill was passed into law as the National Senior Citizens Centre Act, 2017, to cater for the needs of senior citizens (70 and above). (NAN)
