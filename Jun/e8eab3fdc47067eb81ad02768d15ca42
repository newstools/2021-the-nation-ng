Police in Cross River State on Tuesday paraded 25 persons for gunrunning and other crimes. One of the suspects, an inspector, was in charge of a police station’s armory. Inspector Nathaniel Manasseh was paraded along with two others; Egbe Friday Charkpen and John Agu for gunrunning. Other suspects included nine persons for armed robbery, three for murder, six for cultism, one for car snatching, one for illegal possession of firearms and another for the arson attack on Ini Divisional Police station in Akwa Ibom State. Commissioner of Police Sikiru Akande who briefed journalists during the parade of the 25 suspects said the state is gradually reclaiming its lost glory in the area of security. One of the suspects paraded for gunrunning, Inspector Manasseh claimed that he was charmed by the persons who said they bought guns from him. Egbe Friday confessed that Nathaniel sold AK47 rifles to them. Police sources said guns have been missing in the armoury of which Nathaniel was in charge. “Charm can work at any time and on anybody,” the inspector said when asked how an intelligence officer could fall so cheaply to criminals.
