BBNaija Lockdown ex-housemate, Praise, has demanded public apology from fellow ex-housemate, Bright O for his ex-fiancee but Bright O declined. The BBNaija Reunion show host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, had asked Praise about his grievances with Bright O and he explained how his relationship with his ex-fiancee was damaged due to Bright O’s comments in the House. Praise admitted he made faces and tried imitating many Housemates but it became obvious that BrightO wasn’t down with it and he apologised. Praise demanded an apology to his ex-fiancee, whom he admitted was older than him, from Bright O to which he declined. Praise noted that it’s left for BrightO to apologise publicly or not but he shouldn’t have brought his ex-fiance into the situation or mock her. In his response, Bright O said he’s not going to apologise to Praise neither does he owe his ex-fiancee any apology whatsoever. Vee rose in support of Bright O, saying Praise could have sorted the issue with Bright O rather than insisting on a public apology on national TV.
