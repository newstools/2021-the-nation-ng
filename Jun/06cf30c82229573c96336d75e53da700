Former international Tarila Okorowanta has lashed out at the performance of the Nigeria national team against Cameroon following their two international friendlies in Austria. The Super Eagles failed to win either of the matches in the doubleheader against the Indomitable Lions, losing the first outing 1-0 before playing out a 0-0 draw in the second. Okorowanta believes the Super Eagles should have won the games and Rohr should have relied on his experienced players against the Indomitable Lions. “For us not to win any of the games with Cameroon is not good. I think the coach is trying to test some players in these matches,” Okorowanta told Goal. “You are supposed to pick the best for Cameroon. You cannot underrate any team. Football has changed. “Result is what Nigerians want, whether the Super Eagles play well or not is not the most important thing but the maximum result which is victory. “Rohr is supposed to be preparing the team for the World Cup qualifiers not testing players, he is supposed to use his best against a team like Cameroon.“ The Cameroon friendlies have been arranged as part of the Super Eagles’ preparation for the World Cup qualifiers against Liberia and Cape Verde Islands in August and September, respectively. Okorowanta reiterated that the Super Eagles must rely on their established players for the games and avoid bringing in too many new players.
