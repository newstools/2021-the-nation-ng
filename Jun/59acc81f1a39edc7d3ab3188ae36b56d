Ex-BBNaija Housemate Tochi has stated Wathoni was a “community girl” who liked every guy on the reality show. Tochi used the description for Wathoni when the duo engaged in a heated war of words on the fourth episode of the ongoing Reunion Show. The confrontation began when Wathoni alleged that Tochi made sexual advances at her because Kidwayya had told him that “she’s was an easy catch”. Wathoni insisted if Kiddwaya said she was an easy catch however, Tochi didn’t catch her although he tried but never succeeded. Tochi, however, fired back at her instantly, saying he never made any such advances at her as she wasn’t even his type. He further stated nobody wanted Wathoni in the house contrary to her perception of being hot while adding that she literarily liked every guy on the show. “You literally liked every guy on the show; everybody. No, no, no, no, you want to see crazy? You’re telling me that I did not catch you? “I never asked you out, so why are you going to come to a guy that never asked you out? I didn’t ask you out so why are you crying tears?” “I did not try Wathoni, you’re not even my type.” Amid their argument, Wathoni while talking about Kidd said: “You friend, the community boy said that….” and immediately Tochi clapped back saying “You were the community girl….you were the community girl here cos you were with everybody, from Prince to this person”. Tochi further said Wathoni’s every conversation while in the House revolved completely around men. He said: “If you feel you were hot, why didn’t anybody date you in the House? Every conversation in the house was really about a man for you.”
