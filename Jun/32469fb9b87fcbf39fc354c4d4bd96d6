Crusaders, under the auspices of Niger Delta Peace Advocates (NDPA) have faulted the rising protests and renewed agitations for President Muhammadu Buhari to constitute a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). NDPA in a statement yesterday by its National Coordinator, Osagie Osagiede, accused political office holders from the region of sponsoring the recent protests by Ijaw youths and the ultimatums issued by ex-militant leaders. The group said despite the sincerity in the call for the constitution of the substantive board for the NDDC, the rising tension and threats of bloodshed by the protesters and issuance of ultimatum were misdirected and misplaced. It said the development showed the hidden agenda of the sponsors and their cronies to persuade President Buhari to hurriedly appoint the NDDC board, to fulfil their inordinate ambitions for 2023. The NDPA said it could have been more justifiable if the agitations were predicated on bringing about the realisation of restructuring, equal partnership in the oil and gas industry, true federalism and constructive development. It, however, lamented that those allegedly sponsoring the protests and ultimatums were only interested in stopping the ongoing forensic audit, sacking of the Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, and the constitution of a substantive board to perpetuate their political ambitions and cover up their past loot at the commission.
