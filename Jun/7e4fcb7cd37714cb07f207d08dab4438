For Dr. Rabiu Onaolapo Olowo, living his dreams at a very young age is in fulfilment of destiny. While growing up, he aspired to become an accounting and finance giant with a business conglomerate that will consult for top firms across the world. It did not take long for providence to grant him his heart as he achieved a feat most of his peers would not have achieved in donkey years. It never came easy but with hard work and consistency, armed with the intelligence of the biblical King Solomon and the grace of King David, he was able to climb the ladder of success up high within a short time. With less attention, the highly cerebral graduate of Accounting from Kogi-State University loves to let his achievement speak more volumes of him. The tennis lover, who holds a Ph.D. in Forensic Accounting & Auditing loves to give back by sharing his God-given knowledge with others. With his burning passion for academics, he heavily supports research & learning by offering his services at the Lagos State University as an Associate Lecturer/Adjunct Professor and Executive in Residence where he teaches finance and accounting pro bono. On June 14, the Lagos Mainland politician celebrated his 36th birthday devoid of unnecessary attention. Ranked as one of the youngest and brightest commissioners in the Babajide Sanwooluâ€™s cabinet, his staff, friends, and well-wishers were full of excitement to celebrate and share in his pot of joy. In his office, several gifts, birthday cards, and gigantic cake trooping in as he was serenaded with birthday songs.
