The Minority caucus of the House of Representatives has challenged the Federal government to rise up to the occasion and address the issue of threat to life as alleged by the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa. The caucus said the government should not sweep the alleged threat under the carpet, while asking the EFCC boss to expose the names of those threatening his life as well as the issue of corruption involving such individuals. The EFCC Chairman had alleged that he was receiving death threat by those he said are involved in corruption issues. However, in a statement signed by Minority Leader of the House, Rep. Ndudi Elumelu, the caucus said it was disturbed by the silence of the Government to the worrisome development, which it said smacks of attempt to shield corrupt officials within its system, and will hold it responsible should any harm befall the EFCC Chairman. The statement said “Our caucus calls on the EFCC Chairman to go public and expose the names of those threatening him as well as issues of corruption involving such individuals. “We also demand an immediate investigation into the revelation as such threats on the life of the EFCC Chairman cannot be glossed over. “Moreover, the Minority caucus is alarmed over the indictment of a female minister in the APC-led Federal Government for buying a $37.5 million from a bank and deposited $20 million cash. “The minority caucus notes that this revelation by the EFCC is another sad commentary on the monstrous corruption and treasury looting going on in the APC-led administration. “The caucus urges the EFCC Chairman not to be deterred by the threats but remain focused as well as go ahead to disclose the identities of those behind the threats as well as that of the said minister for appropriate action.”
