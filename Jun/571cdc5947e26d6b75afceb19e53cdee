A pressure group, the Itsekiri Political Advancement Front (IPAF), has urged Deltans to support those indigenous to Itsekiri to become Deputy Governor and Delta South Senator in 2023. The National Chairman of the group, Comrade Dennis Abugewa Mene, made the call at the inauguration ceremony of IPAF’s executive in Warri, Delta State. He said the demands became necessary because no Itsekiri person has occupied the positions, even though the people have supported others in their political pursuits from 1999 till date. Comrade Mene stated: “We can longer continue to be relegated in the political scheme of things at the state level and at the federal level, despite our huge contributions to the state and national economies. “Despite our contributions to the national economy and our peaceful disposition, we have been relegated to a nation of Commissioner for Women Affairs and SAs (special assistants), at the state level and mere board members at the federal level. “We have been relegated politically for too long. We would not continue to complain, but have decided to take our destiny in our own hands.” Continuing, he said: “We call on our brothers and sisters from other senatorial districts and our senatorial district (Delta South) for the sake of equity and fairness, to support Itsekiri people as Deputy Governor and Senator Representing Delta South Senatorial District.” A don and cleric, Prof. Gabriel Yomere, stressed the need for the Itsekiri nation to have backup plans, as well as put machinery in place to actualise her political goals in 2023 and beyond. A member of the Itsekiri Leaders of Thought (ILOT), Sir A. S. Mene, who was represented by Mr Fred Atikpekpe, said Itsekiri nation must set up a political debate to produce the best representatives for the tribe.
