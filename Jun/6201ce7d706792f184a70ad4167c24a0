Popular afro-pop singer Tekno has revealed why it is impossible for him to be in a monogamous relationship. Tekno made this known via his Instagram stories. The talented recording artiste, who has a child with his colleague, Lola Rae, noted although he wants to be with one woman for the rest of his life there are so many beautiful women around the world who make such sincere desire futile. In a series of videos on his Instagram stories, the “Skeletun” crooner said; “A lot of times, I wonder who is to blame because when I think about it; when I watch a movie or I read a nice story in the novel, it feels good and it seems interesting that a man and a woman spend the rest of their lives together. “It kind of makes sense. ”But in reality, it is just weird because I want to love one person and be with them but it is impossible because the women are so beautiful. There are so many beautiful women everywhere around the world.”
