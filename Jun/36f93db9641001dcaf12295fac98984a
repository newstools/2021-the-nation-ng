The 13th episode of the ongoing BBNaija Reunion show was filled with repercussions of gossip and effects. The show had kicked off with the host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, instructing the ex-Housemates to write the name of the persons they feel gossip most in the house. The responses were written on a piece of paper and thrown into a box. Ebuka proceeded to reveal the names written by the ex-Housemates and the votes had Bright O emerging as the biggest gossip in the House. Lucy, Neo, Tochi, and Bright Oâ€™s came up but Bright O had more numbers than other names. He was closely followed by Neo, who was perceived as a lousy personality. Ebuka proceeded to show videos of Bright O sharing gist with different Housemates including Tochi, Kiddwaya, and others. The video had Ebuka asking BrightO reasons for saying Neo talks too much and lied to which he responded by repeating the same thing he said. In his defence, Neo noted that he was being himself and not a lousy personality while in the house. When queried, Bright O said he had nothing to say about the vote but all the ex-Housemates agreed the votes spoke their minds loud and clear.
