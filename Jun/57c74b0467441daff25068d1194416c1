A policeman was on Sunday killed while many others were injured in a dawn attack by suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on a police station in Ini local government area of Akwa Ibom State. Police reportedly launched a counterattack, killing one of the assailants. There were unconfirmed reports that more persons were killed in the crossfire. The Nation learnt that the attackers invaded the area with motorcycles and immediately opened fire on the police station. Eyewitnesses said the operation lasted only a few minutes as men of the Police Quick Intervention Unit (QIU) with their counterparts from Ikot Ekpene Area Command fired back. Three motorcycles and a Toyota Venza car believed to have been abandoned by the fleeing hoodlums were seen at the scene of the incident.
