Leicester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho’s rise to Foxes favourite hasn’t been simple, while he describes his special bond with fellow countryman Wilfred Ndidi. Fans of Leicester who follows the Foxes players closely are aware that Nigerian compatriots Iheanacho and Ndidi are close friends as well as both being vital to the contemporary Leicester team. Iheanacho said  the pair formed a bond while playing with Nigeria’s Under-17 side; furthermore, the former Manchester City man claims the ex-Genk midfielder cheers him up and leaves him constantly laughing. He said: “Most importantly during my trying times, he really helped me a lot, he talks to me and he is always there, in training and at home. “He said he wasn’t surprised that I’m scoring goals because he always believed it was going to happen. He is really a good friend of mine.” Recently Iheanacho spoke of the difficulties that aggressive criticism or booing in stadia causes professional footballers. The striker described the experience of being jeered by the club’s own supporters as “draining” but said he never lost faith that his career would turn a corner.
