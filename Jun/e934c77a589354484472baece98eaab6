Nollywood actress Stella Damasus has advised fans to work hard but also learn to also relax after so much toil. The 43-year-old model and TV presenter made this known in a video she shared on her Instagram page. “Please, don’t wait until you get older before you take a break, rest, and relax. Not for your mental health but also your physical body when you get old,” she began. “My mother used to tell me when I was much younger because I usually work too hard as everybody wants to make money and be the best. “She always tells me, ‘learn to break and rest because if you overuse your body, one day, that body will shut down on you’. You’re moving now and you’re not taking care of yourself because you are young and you’re not feeling it but when you grow older, you’ll reap the fruit of your labour.” Damasus advised fans to take a cue from her experiences and learn to always take a break after toiling so much to achieve their goals and make ends meet.
