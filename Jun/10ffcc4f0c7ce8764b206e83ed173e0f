Manchester United have had an opening bid of  £67 million ($95m) rejected for Jadon Sancho. The England international is one of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s top targets this summer after a deal failed to materialise for the 21-year-old last year due to a gap between the two sides over valuation. Solskjaer is still keen to strengthen the right-wing and discussions have been ongoing with Sancho’s camp and Borussia Dortmund over a potential transfer, with the former Manchester City man keen on a move. Sancho remains a top target for Man Utd despite them missing out last summer and Dortmund are prepared to let him leave in the current transfer window should they get the fee they are after. United are optimistic a deal can be struck for the England star, however, Goal can confirm that their initial bid fell short of what Dortmund are willing to accept.
