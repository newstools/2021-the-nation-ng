He stressed that the platform would offer Nigerians regardless of age a forum to discuss and chat about all the issues affecting their wellbeing as citizens. “By speaking, we would erase the divide and understand each other better. I think to a great degree we would see that we have a lot more than we think we have in common and that is why this app has been developed. We have been working on the development of the app for more than 2 years even though I have been nurturing this idea ten years ago. On this app, there is a voice note. You can leave messages through voice notes. We are going to have language variations as we go along which I think is enormous’ he added.
