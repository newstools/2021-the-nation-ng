Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic (ASUP) Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, Ogun chapter, Comrade Chibuzor Osifalujo, has cried out over what he called the ‘sorry state of the workers of the institution’ owing to alleged failure of the State Government to pay outstanding salaries for March and April. Osifalujo accused Governor Dapo Abiodun of insensitivity to the plight of the teeming workers of the Polytechnic, who he claimed are being owed four months salary arrears. According to the union leader, the Governor failed to give approval to workers’ outstanding salaries from the internally generated revenue ‘in spite of weeks of requests and appeals.’ The union stated the Governor’s attitude towards the welfare of the workers was making life unbearable for the workers as their case is becoming hopeless despite their unwaivering sacrifice to the institution and the state. Osifalujo claimed the non-approval of workers’ salaries in due time has caused serious health issues to them, adding that the institution just two weeks ago, lost a staff due to common curable malaria. The chairman said: “I have personally been sick waiting patiently that once salary is approved for payment, i will go for treatment only to be reliably informed that the Governor was not on seat yet. Our salaries not approved before he left. Does he want us to keep dying?”
