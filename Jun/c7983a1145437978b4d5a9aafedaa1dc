Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has advised Nigerians to cry to God for solutions to the “overwhelming challenges” confronting the nation on many fronts. Obasanjo noted that Nigerians and the leaders at all levels are overwhelmed by the challenges in the land. The elder statesman spoke on Saturday in Abeokuta, Ogun State, during the 16th edition of Prayer Breakfast organised in his honour by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Ogun State chapter. The Prayer Breakfast was observed virtually. Obasanjo is the ‘Asiwaju Onigbagbo’ of Christians in Ogun State. Citing Psalm 27:7, the ex-President harped on the need for prayers to surmount the difficulties the country is contending with currently. He said: “We seem to have been overwhelmed with the crises in our land. That is why we are here. “We have some challenges. These are beyond what we can handle. We have to cry to God. “Our land needs to be healed. We have been overwhelmed. Those in government, executive, legislators, public servant, civil servant, private sector, we are overwhelmed. “God cannot be overwhelmed. He is omnipotent, omnipresent. I believe God will heal our land; that is the reason we are here.” In his short sermon, Archbishop of Lagos Ecclesiastical Province (Anglican Communion), Michael Fape, said Nigeria “is in a very difficult time.” Fape, who spoke on “God’s approval, way for solution to the problem of Nigeria”, made reference to 2 Chronicle 7 vs 14, saying that things have fallen apart in the country and the centre cannot hold. “We steal, we embezzle the resources that should be used for public. Nigeria is in fire need of divine intervention. “We should humble ourselves, repent of our sins and turn away from our wicked ways,” Fape said.
