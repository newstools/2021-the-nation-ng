ITALY could not have asked for a stronger start to Euro 2020, dominating Turkey for a 3-0 victory with a Merih Demiral own goal, Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne. This was not just the opening game for the Azzurri, but also for Euro 2020, preceded by an opening ceremony that included Nessun Dorma sung by Andrea Bocelli. The Stadio Olimpico had 16,000 fans for the first time since March 2020. Marco Verratti was out with a knee problem, after Stefano Sensi and Lorenzo Pellegrini pulled out of the competition with muscular issues. Lorenzo Insigne curled wide, then Ciro Immobile had his shot charged down by a hand, but it was in a natural position. The biggest chance so far came on a corner, Giorgio Chiellini allowed a free header that was fingertipped over the bar by Ugurcan Cakir. Immobile aimed a header just wide of the back post, with Immobile and Leonardo Bonucci attempts, then the Lazio strikerâ€™s shot was straight at the goalkeeper. Just before half-time, there was another much stronger penalty appeal for a Leonardo Spinazzola cross charged down, but under the more relaxed rules introduced two weeks ago, it was not considered worthy of a VAR on-field check.
