Disturbed by incessant complaints about Nigerian Army personnel getting involved in land related disputes, the 81 Division on Wednesday inaugurated a standing committee to look into such issues. General Officer Commanding (GOC), Maj.-Gen. Lawrence Fejokwu who inaugurated the committee at the 81 Division’s headquarters in Victoria Island, Lagos, said it was expected to establish a mechanism for amicable resolution of reported land disputes involving serving and retired personnel. The GOC said with its establishment, soldiers would no longer have to individually go to communities where they purchased land if there are disputes as their cases would be handled by the committee when and where necessary. He said allegations of soldiers invading communities over land issues would also be addressed by the committee should affected communities bring forward their complaints. Fejokwu said: “We are taking another step towards solving the problem of land disputes in 81 Division’s Area of Responsibility (AOR) involving our personnel both serving and retired. We have been inundated with various complaints from both our personnel and communities. “It is either the communities run to us to complaint that soldiers are invading their lands or our soldiers are complaining that they bought lands overtime that have appreciated and the communities revoked such lands and want to reallocate them to other lands.”
