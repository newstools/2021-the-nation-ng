Five suspected armed robbers have been shot dead by policemen in Ugba, headquarters of Logo Local Government Area of Benue State. The suspected armed robbers have for the past five months held residents of Ugba and entire Sankera hostage over their criminal activities, which included kidnappings, banditry, theft and armed robbery. A resident of Ugba town told The Nation exclusively that the gang at a point, in a telephone conversation that leaked, threatened the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) to either seek transfer and leave the town or get killed. The Nation gathered that the five-man gang met their Waterloo on Friday night during an operation in which they robbed residents from house to house at about 3am. The police had responded swiftly to a call by one of the victims and subsequently engaged the robbers in a gun duel. Five of them were shot dead while two policemen sustained injuries. A policeman stationed in the community, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the incident but referred our correspondent to Benue State Police command headquarters in Makurdi. However, there was jubilation in Ugba town, as residents trooped out to the catch a glimpse of the corpses of the suspects at the Divisional Police Headquarters in Ugba.
