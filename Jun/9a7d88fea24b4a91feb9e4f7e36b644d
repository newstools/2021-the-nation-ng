Nollywood actress Damilola Adegbite has urged single mothers never to deprive their children the opportunity of enjoying fatherly love. The single mother of one has advised other single mothers to allow their kids have access to their dads. In commemoration of the Father’s Day celebration on Sunday; the actress took to her Instagram page to address single mothers on the significance of fathers’ involvement in the lives their children. Damilola Adegbite urged single mothers to allow their children’s fathers to be involved in their lives as much as possible; while adding that the children will eventually grow and someday inquire to know why they were deprived of fatherly love. Sharing an image which had the inscription: “A FATHER’S MESSAGE To single mothers, the ‘Tinsel’ actress captioned post; “There are three categories of single mothers: the ones whose children’s fathers cannot be in their life (e.g dead, incarcerated etc.); The ones whose children’s fathers have abandoned them or who do more harm than good being a part of their lives (e.g cases of domestic violence); and then lastly, the ones who intentionally keep their children/child away from their father because they are angry, bitter, hurt and vengeful. “To ‘category 3′ mums, today is a good day to reassess the situation. There are many awesome fathers who genuinely crave to be in their children’s lives but are not allowed to by their moms. Trust me, I understand how you feel. Please soften your heart towards them and make decisions based on what’s best for your child. You will not always be able to keep them separated from their father. May our children not grow up and blame us or despise us for depriving them of their fathers’ love. Happy Father’s Day to all the amazing dads. You are loved and appreciated.”
