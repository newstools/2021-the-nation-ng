Leaders of the Pan Yoruba group Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Middle Belt Forum (MBF) and other eminent Nigerians have called for a brand new Constitution before 2023 general elections. They argued the current 1999 Constitution does not represent the interests of the people. The regional leaders spoke during Nigeria’s 2023 Presidential Transition Inter-Ethnic Peace Dialogue with the theme: “Restructuring and 2023 power shift: Nigeria’s make or break factor for political survival” organised by Youths Off The Street Initiative (YOTSI). In a communiqué at the end of the dialogue, participants insisted that the new Constitution should provide for ‘True Federalism’ that would heralds a restructured Nigeria. They also called on the Presidency to live up to its mandate of preserving lives and property by contending with the current insecurity. Part of the communiqué reads: “Demands the Convocation of emergency ‘National Conference’ to take place in the Year 2022 to fashion out a New Federal Constitution on the Way Forward for the Federating Regions. “Agrees that the ‘2023 Presidency’ should be Zoned to the South. “Demands the Amendment of the ‘Electoral Law’ to provide for Electronic Voting and Real-time Transmission of Results before 2023 General Elections, to provide for transparency, accountability and to allow the ‘Sanctity of the Ballot Box’ and to reduce electorates’ voting apathy. “Insists that ‘Federal Character’ should be used in federal appointments. “Charges the Federal Government to urgently address the recurring security challenges in the Country as part of the efforts to avert a second civil war and possible disintegration of the Country. “The Dialogue expressed its belief in a United Nigeria and does not support or believe in secession but insists on acts of equality, peace and justice.”
