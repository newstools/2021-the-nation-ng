Sources close to former Senate President Bukola Saraki told Sentry that the Ilorin-born politician is currently happier than he has been in the recent past. They claim his new found happiness may not be unconnected with the 2023 general elections. “The senator is a very happy man. He is glad that his party the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is finding its feet gradually and returning to winning ways,” a source said. It was also gathered that the former Kwara State governor is very pleased with the results of the efforts of the National Reconciliation Committee of the PDP which he chairs. Aside that, the recent victory of the opposition party in a bye election in Kaduna State has added to his optimism as the 2023 general elections draws nearer. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last weekend declared Usman Baba of the PDP winner of the bye-election for Sabon Gari Constituency in the Kaduna State House of Assembly. An elated Saraki wasted no time before taking to his Twitter handle to celebrate the result and assure members of the party that with its new found unity of purpose, PDP is ready to return to power come 2023.
