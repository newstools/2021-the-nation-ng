Bandits have reportedly threatened to invade Olofa Way, a community in Egbedore local council area of Osun State. The Nation gathered that the threat was contained in a letter written on three pieces of paper and dropped at strategic places in the community. In it they demanded N20 million, failing which they will kill everybody in the community. “We will kill all the hunters that attempt to waylay us, we are coming fully armed,” they said. Field Commandant of Osun Amotekun, Amitolu Shittu, confirmed the incident but said security had been stepped up.
