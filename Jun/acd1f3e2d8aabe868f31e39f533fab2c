The Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly said it has passed 19 out of 52 sponsored bills into law in two years of the existence. Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Aniefiok Akpan stated this yesterday while giving a summary of the achievements of the Assembly in Uyo, the state capital, yesterday. Akpan, who said the 7th Assembly concentrated on making laws that are beneficial to the people, stated that the members were interested in ensuring that the bills were assented to by the Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel. He stated that the idea was to ensure that the bills passed don’t get rejected by the Governor because of their shortcomings. “In terms of lawmaking at various stages, we have sponsored about 52 bills, some of them have passed Third Reading and some of them have been assented to. Akpan reiterated that the Assembly was committed to a legislative agenda that is focused on the people. He stated that despite the COVID-19 pandemic and strike by legislative workers which hindered their work, members have empowered members of their constituencies in different ways. He mentioned that the Assembly was instrumental to the resolution of the strike embarked upon by the Joint Action Committee in the Akwa Ibom State University. He stated that the strike was called off within 48 hours of the intervention of the Assembly, adding that academic activities have resumed on the two campuses of the university.
