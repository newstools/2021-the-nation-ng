The Appeal Court in Abuja has granted the request by the publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore for more time to file a notice of appeal, challenging the conditions attached to the bail granted him by a Federal High Court in Abuja. Sowore and one of his associates, Olawale Bakare are being tried before a Federal High Court in Abuja on a treasonable felony charge filed by the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), in relation to their involvement in the #RevolutionNow protest. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu granted them bail in October 2019 and imposed conditions, including restricting Sowore’s movement to Abuja and barring him from addressing press conference and participating in rallies. Tuesday, his lawyer, Marshall Abubakar argued his motion for leave to appeal out of time to enable him file a notice of appeal. In a ruling, a three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, led by Justice Moore Adumein granted Sowore’s request and ordered him to file within 14 days. The court made an order “extending the time within which the applicant/appellant may file his notice of appeal against the ruling of the Federal High Court, Abuja judicial division in charge number: FHC/ABJ/CR/235/2019, between Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Omoyele Sowore and one other delivered by his lordship, Honourable, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, on the 21st day of October, 2019, the time within which to file same having elapsed.”
