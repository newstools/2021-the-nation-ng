Victims of Tuesday’s kidnap attack in a hotel at Ayetoro-Ekiti in Ido/Osi Local Government Area of Ekiti have been freed by their abductors. Ekiti Police spokesman, ASP Sunday Abutu, told The Nation the abductees were freed at Ikun Ekiti, Moba Council Area after a serious manhunt by men of the command. Abutu clarified only two persons were abducted during the attack contrary to the circulated report that four persons were abducted inside the hotel. He said: “The two abductees have regained their freedom. They were freed yesterday (Wednesday) at about 10:30pm close to Ikun bridge in Moba local government Area. “Two people were actually kidnapped, the third person, who is the security man, was matcheted but was not taken away”. Abutu also debunked the claim that someone was raped during the attack, saying the investigation didn’t reveal this.
