Cattle Dealers Association of Nigeria (CDAN) Imo chapter has blamed Myetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MBAN) for the excesses of killer herdsmen in South East and across the nation. CDAN chairman, Ibrahim Salihi, during a courtesy visit to Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu in Owerri, alleged Miyetti Allah was allying with killer herdsmen instead of condemning them for destroying farmlands with no compensation. He said: “The Miyetti Allah is not helping matters they are allying with this group, encouraging these people to destroy farms. “For example, you have your farm and I have my own and I destroy your own instead of saying sorry you say I will pay you, if you pay me today and tomorrow you don’t, I will get angry and I will cut your cow and from there problem starts.” CDAN stated herdsmen who carry AK 47 came from Central Africa, adding they also attack herdsmen and kill their cows. “It is the Fulani herdsmen that are carrying guns even attacking us who are not with them they kill our cows,” he said. The group appealed to the Federal Government to check influx of these killer herdsmen into Nigeria, saying that many of them are not Nigerians. According to them: “Another problem is that the Federal Government is not doing enough, as they are not screening these people coming in from Central Africa into Nigeria. “The Federal Government should check Fulanis coming into the country ànd even the State Governments should do the same. “So, we have come to appeal to Chief Iwuanyanwu to intervene in the insecurity in the land because we don’t want to listen to the group of people calling us to come back to the North.” Iwuayanwu assured that Governor Hope Uzodimma has taken necessary steps to permanently end the challenge in a month.
