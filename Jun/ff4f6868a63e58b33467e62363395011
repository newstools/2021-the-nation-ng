General  Muhammed Gado  Nasko is a highly respected , thoughtful and exemplary patriot.  He is a revered statesman; a just and fair-minded professional military leader. He is humane, fair minded and often  shows justice in his decision making  and in executive orders as a military    leader   and  administrator. I served under him as a Battery Commander in Oyo and also as a Grade 1 Staff Officer when he took over the appointment of Commander Corps of Artillery.   It was indeed a privilege  and a challenging experience working with him. He is a totally detribalized Nigerian who encouraged merit and distinction regardless of tribal or sectarian  provenance.  He was very generous to my family. He embraced myself and my wife  Oluyemisi as   if  we were an extension of his own family. I gained a lot  from his leadership and  widened my command experience under his martial wings. If there is a   leader one can follow to the battlefield  without any qualms,  General Nasko typifies that emblematic leadership. He is instinctively dependable,   principled   and inspirational. I have gained considerably from his admirable vision, from the genuineness of his shepherding authority,  from  the truth of his wisdom  and from the wizened candor of his personal  discipline. Yet, he remains humble, approachable,  free spirited, true to himself, true to his friends, committed to the service of his nation and mankind. My family will forever remain grateful to him for his kindness and love.  May  the almighty  Allah continue to preserve and protect him and his household as he soldiers on in his devotion to  humanity.
