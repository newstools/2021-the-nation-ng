Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) has named its new edifice after its late Managing Director Tayo Aderinokun. Aderinokun, the co-founder and former Managing Director of the bank, died a decade ago. The bank stated that the Tayo’s Plaza  would be dedicated to the  screening and on-boarding programmes for its employees on delivering the best customer experience in financial services. The plaza, an eight-storey building in the heart of Abeokuta, Ogun State was inaugurated at the weekend. Aderinokun was one of Africa’s most influential and renowned bankers. Born in 1955, his passion for excellence, entrepreneurial acumen and dedication to service led to his co-founding of GTBank in 1990. He became GTBank’s Managing Director in August 2002, leading it to the enviable position of one of Nigeria’s best managed financial institutions until his passing on Tuesday, June 14 2011. The plaza has 105 ensuite residential rooms, six lecture halls, two  libraries, an amphitheatre and a banking hall with 24 teller terminals, among other facilities. The bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Segun Agbaje, said: “Through our new training complex, we will continue to nurture and empower young people to think critically and break new grounds in excellence.” Former Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, said Aderinokun left a great legacy that should be sustained by his family. He said infrastructure was needed for sustainable economic development to be achieved. He said the impact of the new training centre on the state would be massive.
