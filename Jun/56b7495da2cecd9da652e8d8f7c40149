The Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar on Tuesday called for the removal of the immunity clause in the Nigerian constitution, saying it will compel Nigerian leaders to live up to their responsibilities. The Sultan who spoke at the ongoing Zonal public hearing for the constitutional amendment of the 1999 constitution also advocated a constitutional role for traditional rulers, saying it was time Nigerians talk frankly on how they want the country managed. Addressing stakeholders at the Kebbi zonal hearing comprising Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara, the Sultan said the crisis in the country today can be blamed on the relegation of the traditional rulers to the background without a constitutional role, insisting that before the Nigerian nation came into be in 1914, the traditional institution had existed. He said; “One of the controversial issues which I feel strongly about is the immunity clause. When you are immune, nobody can take you to court as a leader and it means that you can do whatever you want to do. You can claim to be God. “But when that immunity is removed and you are made to live in a society where people are taken to court for abuse of office, I think our leaders here will wake up. Let us see how to tinker with that immunity clause. “Will it be better to give immunity to a few people or remove the immunity so that all of us will be equal? It is another food for thought. So, please don’t hold back, speak your mind on how you want this country to move on.”
