Chief Executive Officer of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg has announced four new features to aid businesses and shopping on the brand’s Instant Messaging app, WhatsApp and photo-sharing app, Instagram. Zuckerberg disclosed this on Tuesday evening through his verified Facebook account. He listed the upcoming features as Shops on WhatsApp and Marketplace, Instagram Visual Search and Shops Ads. Explaining the functions of the features, Zuckerberg wrote: “Instagram Visual Search: helps you discover products based on images that inspire you. “Shops on Marketplace: more than 1 billion people use Marketplace each month, so we’re making it easy for businesses to bring their Shops into Marketplace to reach even more people. “Shops on WhatsApp: soon you’ll be able to view a Shop in WhatsApp so you can chat with a business before buying something. “Businesses only need to set up their shop once to have it work across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. “Shops Ads: we’re launching new ads to personalize the shopping experience and point you to a Shop’s curated collection.”
