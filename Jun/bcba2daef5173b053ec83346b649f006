Some suspects have been taken into police custody in Ebonyi following the abduction three weeks ago of seven children in Enyigba community in Abakaliki, the state caoital. Police say the kingpin of the kidnap gang was among those arrested. Governor David Umahi confirmed this in a statement issued by Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Uchenna Orji. Warlords from neighbouring Enyibichiri in Ikwo council area were blamed for the kidnap. Governor Umahi issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Echibiri community to produce the culprits. Orji, in the statement, said the governor was pleased that the “alleged kingpin of the abduction, with a few of his gang members, have been apprehended by the police. They are presently in police custody”.
