The All Progressives Congress (APC) will win the presidency in the 2023 elections, House of Representatives member, Rev. Francis Ejiroghene Waive, has predicted. He also said main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was wary of the victory. The lawmaker spoke on Sunday during a visit to a chieftain of the party, Olorogun Ogbarode Ogbon, at Effurun in Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State. Waive represents Ughelli North, Ughelli South and Udu Federal Constituency in the National Assembly on the platform of the ruling APC. Emphasising the need for APC faithful across the state and particularly, in Ughelli South to be patient, he urged them to be united so as to benefit in due time. The lawmaker added that the founding leader of the party in the state, Olorogun O’tega Emerhor is already providing “leadership that brings people together and stands for truth. “Some of the things I do are suggestions from constituents. I assure members of the APC that we will not be sectional, we will not be divisive. “Ughelli South is the second-largest base of the PDP but we have what it takes to change the narrative, neither to spite leadership nor fathers. Ogbon, who expressed delight over the visit, noted that past defeats recorded by the APC were self-inflicted. and were perhaps meant to teach the party lessons to work vigorously for victory in 2023.
