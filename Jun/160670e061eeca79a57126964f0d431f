 Dagbana Republik boss, Bella Shmurda, has finally graduated from the Lagos State University (LASU). Bella Shmurda, who has been keeping fans updated with details of his final exams, shared clips from his ‘sign out’ ritual via his insta stories. The “Vision 2020” singer recently set social media agog with a viral video he posted of himself while in an examination hall.  The video showed the ‘Dagbana” crooner in an examination hall holding a pen over his examination papers. In one of the videos shared on his insta stories yesterday, June 29, the singer was heard saying; “Signing out, it’s a new western zone.” Bella proudly noted he was a BSC holder, a true historian after years of dedicatedly studying in LASU. The caption that accompanied the post reads: “Fours in LASU is really nothing, but I don do my own commot.”
