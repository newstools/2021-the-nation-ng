Singer and songwriter, Tiwa Savage, is ready to shun all talks and drama to release a new EP before the end of the year. Savage gave the strongest hint yet of her upcoming EP release plans with a post shared on her Instagram account on Friday, June 18, 2021. She wrote, “I’m the topic and the top pick. Water And Garri EP real soon.” She returned barely one hour after the post to announce her plans for the EP on her InstaStories saying, “I go vex drop this EP oo, don’t play with me.” On Thursday night, Savage was spotted with her friends including actress, Dorcas Shola Fapson, in a night club and her team. She was also spotted smoking shisha in a video shared on her Instagram page. Much has changed since Savage’s last album, Celia, which was released in 2020. Savage recently got into a fight with Seyi Shay at a highbrow salon on Victoria Island but has remained silent until her recent post.
