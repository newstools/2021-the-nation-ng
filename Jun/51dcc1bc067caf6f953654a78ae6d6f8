The Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide has expressed its supports for the ongoing urban renewal programme of the Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri. The President, IYC, Peter Timothy Igbifa, in a statement in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, said the programme, which had led to the demolition of illegal structures and shanties in Yenagoa was necessary in order to give Bayelsa an aesthetic look befitting a capital city. Igbifa also commended Diri for donating operational vehicles to him and the leader of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), saying the gesture would fill a yawning gap in their activities. He said: “I assure you that the entire council is behind you. We are also in support of your urban renewal programme in Yenagoa, our state capital. “Yenagoa, the capital city of all Ijaw nations must be the envy of other capital cities in the country and we are happy you have taken the bull by the horn to give us our desired capital city despite the prevailing difficulties. “I call on the entire Ijaw nation to support this urban renewal programme. I know it is not easy, but nothing good comes without difficulties and sacrifices.  On Diri’s donation of a brand new vehicle to him, Igbifa said: “Since my private car, which I used to discharge my official functions, was wrecked in an accident, it has been difficult to navigate my ways around the region. “As I keep thanking God for sparing my life and the lives of those who were with me during the accident, I will also continue to remain grateful to Governor Diri for his support. “This vehicle is coming at the right time and I assure you it will make my job easier. May God continue to give you more wisdom and tact as you lead our people.  The council I lead will continue to consult and partner with you for the overall interest of the Ijaw nation.”
