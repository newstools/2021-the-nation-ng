The Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District, Ifeanyi Ubah, was on Thursday cleared to fly the flag of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) during the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State. The national leadership of YPP presented Ubah with a certificate of clearance during its meeting in Abuja. Speaking with reporters after collecting the certificate, Ubah insisted that the ongoing security situation in the southeast would not affect the conduct of the Governorship poll already fixed for November this year by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He expressed optimism that the YPP would emerge victorious saying that other political parties do not have the interest of Anambra State at heart. The Anambra South lawmaker also debunked rumours the YPP is allegedly behind the crisis bedeviling the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Grand Alliance in the state ahead of the poll.
