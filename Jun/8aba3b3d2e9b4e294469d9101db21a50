 Efetobor ‘The Nigerian Pitbull’ Apochi suffered his first professional defeat on Sunday at The Armory in Minneapolis, USA, losing by a split decision to Brandon Glanton in their 10-round bout however the cruiserweight wants a rematch with the former American Football player as quickly as possible. The undefeated American, now 14 wins with 11 knockouts, scored a knockdown to close out the sixth round as Apochi fell into the ropes. That knockdown proved the difference as judge Nelson Vazquez scored the bout 96-93 for Apochi, but was overruled by judges Mike Fitzgerald and John Mariano who both scored the contest 95-94 for Glanton. “What can I say?” asked Apochi after the fight. “I thought I won the fight. I used my jab, showed some heart, had some good movement in there, but I’m not the judges. I don’t know what they saw, but I thought that I did what I had to do. He’s a tough guy. I won’t take anything away from him. He took some tough shots and he was still there.” “Of course, I want a rematch with Glanton,” continued Apochi. “I want a rematch with him right now!
On the possibility of a rematch, Glanton said, “If they want the rematch, then I’ll do it again. I think I’ve proven what I needed to prove, but it’s easier the second time.”
