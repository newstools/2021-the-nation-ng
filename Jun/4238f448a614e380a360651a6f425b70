The Austrian football federation has urged its fans not to travel to London for the Euro 2020 clash with Italy, confirming it tried and failed to have it postponed or moved. The Round of 16 is due to kick off on Saturday at Wembley Stadium at 20.00 UK time. Both the Italian and Austrian authorities have raised doubts about the wisdom of the fixture, considering how rapidly COVID-19 cases are rising in England, particularly the Delta variant, which is still relatively under control in mainland Europe. A statement from the ÖFB this afternoon confirms there will be no postponement of the European Championship Round of 16 tie, “despite great efforts” to have it moved from London to another venue. As there is a quarantine requirement for Austrians travelling to and from London, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs “strongly advises all fans not to attend” the match. Considering the semi-finals and the Final of Euro 2020 are also due to be played at Wembley, with the attendance expanded to 60,000, the tension between UEFA and the European governments is intensifying.
