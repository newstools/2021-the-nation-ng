Maj. Hamza Al Mustapha, Chief Security Officer (CSO) to the late military head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, says he decided to join politics in 2019 to create opportunities for Nigerian youths to actualise their potential. Al Mustapha said this when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja. “I created the Green Party for the youth, women, the poor and people living with disabilities, it is a party that has to do with the future of Nigeria. “Having criss-cross from the North to the South and after meeting this class of Nigerians who are mostly neglected, I decided to form a party that will create opportunities for the Nigerian youths to actualise their potential. “I did it for the strategic reason of having investments on the younger ones. “The word Green Party has many connotations and so I made contacts with green institutions across the world towards creating opportunities for Nigerian youths,” Al Mustapha said. He said that the target was to empower Nigerian youths with skills towards self-reliance. “I spoke with the Green Party in Germany with the aim of getting funding for training of our youths on skills acquisition. “I also made contact with individuals in Korea and China towards the same aim of empowering our youths with skills. “All these cumulated into the formation of the party,” he said. Al Mustapha said, however, that he couldn’t feature at the 2019 presidential poll for some reasons. “I was to participate in the 2019 presidential election on the understanding that certain people were not to contest in the election. “I had to decline when I learnt that the people were contesting after given their words,” he said. Al Mustapha said since the Green Party was among those affected by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) delisting of parties, he would move somewhere. “If you want to hear from me, you have to wait until the end of 2021, you will see us visibly somewhere then,” he said.
