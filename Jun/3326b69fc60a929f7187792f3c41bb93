Grammy award winner, Wizkidayo has finally responded to Seun Kuti amid continuous shading on his Grammy recognition. The Nation had reported the youngest son of legendary Afrobeat king, Fela, Seun Kuti continues to downplay the Grammy recognition of Biz Wiz even after taking receipt of his Grammy plaque on Wednesday, June 23, 2021. The saxophonist had reiterated the face that there are only four musicians in Nigerian whose music has been nominated for Grammy, a list which did not include Wizzy. Seun also stated that an album is way different from a music video while noting Big Wiz will someday make worthy music that will attract real Grammy recognition. The 38-year-old went further to inform his trolls and haters, that is, Wizkid FC to brace up as he was all set to bash them really hard; noting he has dedicated all of today to achieve that. Amid all of these, Big Wiz took to social media to respond to Seun where he referred to him as ‘brother’ while urging him, quite in what appears to be a sarcastic manner to ignore his troublesome fans, grab his sax and make some good music as they are still basking in the euphoria of his last album. He wrote: “No mind them jare. Get the sax and make some music, brother… We all enjoyed your last album we still dey dance like this.” Seun Kuti has also responded to Wizkidayo promising to ignore the “Ojuelegba” singer’s troublesome fans. According to the current leader of ‘Egypt 80’ band, he only agreed to let go because the plea came directly from Wizkdayo as he is considered family. He wrote: “Okay me blood. I go leave them but na because of you o!”
