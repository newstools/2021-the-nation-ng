Chelsea star N’Golo Kante has been handed an incredible snub from his fellow professionals. Kante, who helped Thomas Tuchel’s men win the Champions League last weekend, has failed to make the shortlist for the Professional Footballers’ Association ‘Players’ Player of the Year’ award. Four players from Manchester City have made the six man shortlist, including Kevin De Bruyne, Ruben Dias, Phil Foden and Ilkay Gundogan. But despite being the inspiration behind the Blues’ stunning triumph over Pep Guardiola’s side in Porto, Kante has not been nominated by his fellow peers.
