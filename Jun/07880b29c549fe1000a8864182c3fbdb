A decision to allow people to enter Germany from Britain for the Euro 2020 football tournament is yet to be agreed upon, tournament director Martin Kallen has said. Kallen said on Monday that “the German government has presented a solution” as the ruling body UEFA continues discussions with the local government. “We don’t have it concretely on the table yet, but one thing is clear: Our goal must be that no quarantine is imposed. With negative tests, that should be possible,” Kallen said. Britain is considered a virus variant area. Current travel rules in Germany state that entering the country from a virus variant area is permitted only for German citizens and residents there. Those outside this group must quarantine for 14 days and cannot get out of it not even with a negative coronavirus test. The German city of Munich will host three group stage matches and also one quarter-final game on July 2. This will feature a team that has played in the last 16 in London a few days earlier. “This could become a problem if a team has played in London and then has to travel to Munich for the quarter-finals,” Kallen said. Chancellery minister Helge Braun recently said the interior and health ministries were discussing “which groups of people with which protection concepts” would be allowed to enter Germany for the tournament. The Euros are set to start on Friday with Turkey and Italy staging the opening match in Rome.(dpa/NAN)
