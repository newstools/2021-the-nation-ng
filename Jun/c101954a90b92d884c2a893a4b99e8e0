Grammy award-winning singer, Wizkid has changed his signature name on social media. The music superstar made a slight change to his official stage name on his Instagram bio section. In a recent update as seen on his Instagram page, the “Made in Lagos” singer changed his signature name to “Big Wiz”. The name seems to portray the exact image of what his teeming fans have been clamouring for as it reflects the growth and transformation the singer has experienced from when he started as a young chap in the musical entertainment scene to the giant he is metamorphosing into. The singer’s fans had suggested that the name “Wizkid” be replaced with something more befitting noting that their star isn’t a “kid” anymore as a person and also in the musical scene. Thus, one can say the “Ojuelegba” crooner does listen to his fans as he has now effected a change of his signature name.
