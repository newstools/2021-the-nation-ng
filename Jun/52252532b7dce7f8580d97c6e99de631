SUPER Eagles full-back Ola Aina has won Fulham’s Goal of the Season award with his left-footed stunner, which he scored against West Brom on Monday, November 2, 2020. Aina scored a curler outside the area with his left foot to double Fulham’s lead in the first half of that league game. It was Aina’s first-ever goal in the Premier League and since he joined Fulham on loan from Italian side Torino. “Thank you to all the Fulham fans who voted for me for Goal of the Season,” the Nigeria international told the club website. “Ever since I came in, I felt the support. I’m so thankful, and I love you dearly for it. “I appreciated your support throughout the whole season. It was sad that we couldn’t see you that much, but thank you so much.” This is the second award the Nigeria international is getting with that goal.
