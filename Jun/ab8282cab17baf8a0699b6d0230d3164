Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) on Monday expressed concerns over the incessant cross carpeting into the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors and legislators. Their actions, HURIWA said, have done a lot of damage to the nation’s democracy. The group also condemned the cross carpeting across party lines by political office holders, describing it as unconstitutional and unethical. Calling it unbridled political prostitution and lawlessness, HURIWA said it is annoying that the National Assembly that ought to be custodians of the national norm has failed. HURIWA, in a statement by the National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf, alleged President Muhammadu Buhari has violated his constitutional oath of office by accepting and welcoming decampees from the opposition party. It said: “Pure and simple the act of politician’s crossing over from their political parties to the ruling political party because of pecuniary purposes is to put it very mildly, pathetically roguish and absolutely absurd. “It is an act of egregious political corruption which should interest both the EFCC and ICPC if there are independent bodies”.
