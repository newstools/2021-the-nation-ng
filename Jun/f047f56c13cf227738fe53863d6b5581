One of the last six contestants at the Nigerian Idol S6, Emmanuel has bowed out of the reality talent show as five others made it for another week. The show, which is gradually coming to an end, had the top five contestants battling it out for the top spot. Last week’s show was themed pop versus jazz and the contestants were required to perform a song from each genre. Guest judge, Mr. P was also thrilled by the talents as he gives the verdict for the week. Pop Winner: Akunna Faith Jason opened the floor with his rendition of “Someone You Loved” by Louis Capaldi. Comfort took over by performing “Thinking Out Loud” by Ed Sheeran.  Kingdom, performed “Just the Way You Are” by Bruno Mars while Akunna, took the stage to perform “Wrecking Ball” by Miley Cyrus and Francis Atela closed the stage with “Too Good at Goodbyes” by Sam Smith. Following the first round of songs, IK asked the guest judge, Mr. P, who his winner was, and the well-known singer mentioned Akunna. Jazz Winner: Akunna/Kingdom For Jazz, Faith Jason opened the stage with “I’d Rather Go Blind” by Etta James. Comfort seemed to show her level of growth as she performed “Save the Last Dance” by Michael Bublé. Kingdom’s performance left the judges speechless as he performed “Feeling Good” by Nina Simone. Akunna gave a beautiful rendition of “I Put a Spell on You” by Nina Simone. The show finally came to an end with Francis Atela’s rendition, “Hello” by Lionel Richie.
