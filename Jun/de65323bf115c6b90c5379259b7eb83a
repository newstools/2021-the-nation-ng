The Presidency has said it had no hands in the current amendment to the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act by the National Assembly. Media stakeholders have criticised the move to amend the Acts, with some saying it is like a reintroduction of the obnoxious Decree Number 4. Addressing State House Correspondents after yesterday’s virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said the proposed amendments had nothing to do with the Presidency but a government matter. According to him, the amendment move is a government thing, which only the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, can address. “That is not strictly a Presidency thing because the President has nothing to do with that. It’s a government thing and it’s the minister that can talk about it,” he said.
