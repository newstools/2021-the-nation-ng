Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh has claimed she added another ride, a Maybach to her fleet of cars. A few days ago, the mother of one took to Instagram to share stunning her photos and recounted God’s blessings on her 36th birthday. Tonto wrote: “I AM GRATEFUL FOR ALL GOD HAS DONE AND IS DOING IN MY LIFE.. GOD HAS SETTLED ME, GOD WHO IS AND FOREVER WILL BE… ON THIS DAY AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN WAS BORN FOR GREAT THINGS AND GREATNESS SHE BECAME.” Sharing a screenshot of a post in which Uche Maduagwu made in 2019 dissing the actress on her false Bentley acquisition claims, Tonto captioned post: “I remember when I bought my Bentley….
