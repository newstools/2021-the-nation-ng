A group of women on Monday protested against incessant violence, killings and shedding of blood in Nigeria, especially in Anambra state, calling for peace in the state. The protesters, under a Non-governmental Organization, Igbos for a Progressive Nigeria (IPAN), carried placards with varying inscriptions, “We Need Peace”, “Stop Violence”, “Stop Killings”, among other write-ups. Addressing newsmen shortly after the protest, National Woman Leader, Mrs. Juliet Ezenwosu regretted that many youths had lost their lives within the period, adding that security personnel who were supposed to protect the people were also shot. She said the protest was targeted at suing for peace and end to the shedding of blood amongst the youths, as well as other crimes in the state. She said, “We the women are grieved over the continuous killing and shedding of innocent blood across Nigeria. We condemn the act in its entirety, and call for love and unity amongst Nigerians, especially the Igbos.” Ezenwosu called for urgent intervention of both the federal and state governments to ensure sanity and peace were enthroned in the country. A member of the group, Mrs. Mabel Daniel urged politicians in the state to embrace peace and spirit of sportsmanship in the forthcoming gubernatorial election, stressing that nothing was worth the human blood. Also speaking, IPAN National President, Mr. Lawrence Onuzulike while calling for the spirit of oneness among Ndi Igbo, reminding them that killings and violence of all sorts were not their identities. He encouraged leaders at all levels to devise means of bringing the unrests in the country to a permanent end.
