Nollywood actor Chris Iheuwa has reacted to his narration of alleged escape from a ritualist den in a fresh rejoinder shared on his social media handles. Iheuwa apologised for the narration, which he said was not meant to alarm anyone but just to express a creative process. In his rejoinder, Iheuwa wrote: “Thank God I am Alive, A rejoinder. I refer to my previous write-up titled: ‘Thank God I Am Alive…’ published on 4th, June 2021 on the same medium and wish to clarify that it is merely a work of fiction, a literary expression and an excerpt from a feature film screenplay I am working on. For those who actually read it in full, you would notice the credit at the end for the excerpt synonymous with creative work.” Iheuwa noted the narration was misconstrued for reality saying: “For some reason, it may have crossed the line between creativity and realism and misconstrued to be true. I appreciate your concerns and wish to state that it wasn’t meant to alarm anyone, but just to express a creative process.” The ‘La Femme Anjola’ star further said he’s very fine and doing great.
