Coordinator of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) Printing Press, Dr.  Mike Abiodun, has urged undergraduates to venture into publishing, describing it as a viable means of livelihood. He gave the advice to students of the Department of Mass Communication, who visited the university printing press to acquire practical knowledge of book publishing. Describing book publishing as  lucrative,  Abiodun noted that students did not have to wait until they got huge amount to procure machines before they could engage in printing. He urged students to hone their writing skills, adding that it would pave way for them in the publishing world. “You don’t have to own a printing press before you can produce a book. Your writing skill is a great asset. As a good writer, even as a student, you can partner a publisher to produce a book. Once the content is topnotch, then you’re good to go. “However, I won’t advise you to write just any book. Rather pay more attention to academic books like nursery and secondary school books. I challenge you to develop a manuscript on any elementary school subject. I will pay whoever does that  N50,000,” he said. Abiodun condemned the attitude of students who waste their time on the social media engaging in dubious activities when there are a lot of opportunities to tap into, of which he named publishing as one. He charged youths to embrace hardwork, while upgrading their skills to better position them in the labour market. “Human beings have  opportunity to possess three essential skills: the inbuilt or God-given skill/talent, skills acquired from your parents and skills acquired by virtue of learning. If any or all of these skills are effectively utilised, then, the sky remains  the starting point,”  he noted.
