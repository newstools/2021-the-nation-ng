The suspected killer of SuperTV boss, Chidimma Adaora Ojukwu, was last seen in the University of Lagos (UNILAG) before the Covid-19 lockdown, The Nation learnt Thursday evening. It was gathered Ojukwu, said to be a 300 level Mass Communications student, neither wrote examination nor set foot on UNILAG since the commencement of this current semester early last month. Ojukwu was on Thursday morning paraded by the Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu at the Command headquarters Ikeja, nine days after Michael Usifo Ataga was murdered at a Short Service Apartment at 19, Adewale Oshin Street, Lekki, Phase 1, Lagos. A TVC journalist Ayodele Ozugbakun, made the claim in a Facebook post based on information allegedly received from a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mass Communication, University of Lagos (Unilag) Dr Bunmi Ajibade. Dr Ajibade confirmed the information in a chat with The Nation. He however said it was not an official statement on the matter but a personal observation via a WhatsApp broadcast after his findings. Ozugbakun’s post reads: “Enlightenment from Dr. Bunmi Ajibade (Senior Lecturer, Unilag Mass Comm.) ‘We parents should pray for and monitor our children. There is so much evil going on in tertiary institutions now. Drugs, alcohol and s*x have become the order of the day among adolescents. ‘As Coordinator of Part-Time programme, l have made some investigations about the lady. “The last time she came to school was before Covid-19 lockdown. She has never written 300 Level exam with her cohorts. She has never stepped her feet (sic) on the soil of UNILAG since the commencement of this semester early last month. Yet, she was arrested in her father’s house. ‘ ‘Were the parents sensitive enough to discover her truancy in school? “Did they monitor her progress in school if they suspected something is amiss? How come they were apparently neglected that this calamity came upon them suddenly? Many questions are begging for answers.'”
