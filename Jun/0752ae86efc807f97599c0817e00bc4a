Just weeks after the Federal Government banned Twitter, former actress, Carolina Danjuma, has said she doesn’t blame the government for trying to regulate social media. Carolina said this while recounting how she was bullied on social media during her twelve years of marriage. The beautiful mother of one said that people post false news about another without checking their facts. “Sometimes I do not blame the government for trying to regulate social media, anyone can post false information about another and feel good about it. Y’all should give it a rest. Some claiming they went to Uni with me. June 26, I will be 34 years old, super grateful for all my achievements. Yes, I acted for only two years, 2004 to 2006 and it was awesome. I was bullied all through my marriage on social media, why did I marry my grandfather, I stole someone’s husband no one came out, I ain’t the age I claim to be because of Wikipedia. “Now I am immune to your bullying and harsh words. Yes, I am divorced, happy, closer to God, at peace with myself.”
