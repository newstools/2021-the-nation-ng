We have told our men to be on the alert, especially those manning banks across the state.” “I want to assure parents that it is a pure case of robbery. Thank God, the freed lady has told us that they spoke fluent Yoruba to her. Hence, we have nothing to fear. It is not a case of banditry as experienced in some parts of the country,” Salami said.
