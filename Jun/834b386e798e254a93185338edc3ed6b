Nollywood actor, Mofe Duncan has been under heat since he shared a photo of the 4-seed bunch of plantain he purchased at an extremely ridiculous amount. According to Mofe, he recently bought four pieces of plantain at N6,000 which he finds quite absurd and hard to believe. Taking to his official Instagram page to share his experience with Nigerians, Mofe wrote; “This 3 & ¾ bunch of plantain cost N6000 (six thousand naira). Read that again. #WhereDoWeGoFromHere ?” Meanwhile, his post has got social media users talking as many accused Mofe of lying about the amount he got the bunch of plantains even though the noted plantain is currently an expensive commodity but not as much as the actor claims. Actor Mustapha Sholagbade Ololade stated: “That’s not true bro. Maybe 600 naira.” tundewearitall said: “Maybe ur chef or house-help scam u! Cus this plantain is not 6k yet.” Johneshovo wrote: “Tah 6k ke!
