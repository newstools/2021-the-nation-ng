Police in Ebonyi on Monday said they rescued over 26 abducted children from their abductors. Commissioner of Police Aliyu Garba released the information in Calabar, the Cross River State capital, at a meeting with media practitioners on ethical reporting and advocacy to eliminate violence against women and girls. The workshop is funded by the European Union and United Nations under the spotlight initiative. Garba said the children were abducted in Ebonyi and sold in various states of the federation. The CP was represented by the Loveth Okimor Ogbouanya of the police gender desk. He said: “We have recovered 20 children who were sold in other states of the federation but this year we recovered six from traffickers. “It is worrisome that it is the children of the poor that are usually affected. In most cases, they are told to withdraw the case from the police and that they will be given money. I will make sure that the matter goes to court. The commissioner said the police command through the gender desk office has been touring local government areas of the state to ensure that violence against women and girls as well as child trafficking is totally eliminated in Ebonyi. The state government lamented the increase in child stealing and violence against women, girls and children in the state. It raised the alarm that it has recorded over 30 cases of child stealing in one year. Desk Officer in charge of Child Abuse/Trafficking in the state Ministry of Justice Ije?ma Mike-AjaNwachukwu said gender-based violence is becoming a menace in the state.
