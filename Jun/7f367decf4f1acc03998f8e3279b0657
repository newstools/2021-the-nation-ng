John Holt Plc has formed a partnership with The Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV). The conglomerate disclosed this at the Honours Nite, a biennial award event of the Lagos State branch of NIESV, which held recently in Lagos. The Honours Nite recognises the contributions of real estate firms and other relevant industries to the economy. One of the winners on the night was the El Alan Group, which was awarded the John Holt Plc Award for most outstanding development. John Holt Plc, the major sponsor of the event, used the opportunity to introduce its Rapid Intervention Vehicle (JH-RIV), a Fire Suppression Unit. The conglomerate’s senior executive, Kris Nwachukwu, who represented the firm’s group managing director, said the JH-RIV is a complete, advance, rapid response, lightweight extinguishing system that is integrated with water and foam tanks (Dual Agent System). He added that the product, which is already being deployed by several organisations, can be effectively used by estates, office complexes, car parks/garages, markets, schools, hospitals and other facilities where lives and properties need to be secured. He said the uniqueness of the new fire-fighting equipment “lies in its strong and direct impact on fire pockets; its 60metres hose can easily run up staircases and around corners, making full use of its 70 metres operational radius and 10 metres thron rage. Its superior foam application and water convert these agents into water vapour which guarantees minimal water damage. Commenting on the partnership, NIESV Lagos State branch Chairman, Adedotun Bamigbola commended the company’s contributions to NIESV and the estate surveying and valuation profession.”
