Eighteen-year-old Kemisola Oguniyi, who was arrested during the ENDSARS protest, has been delivered of a baby boy in custody. Kemisola, Ayodele Bukunmi, Ojo Samuel and Ani Obinna were remanded at Surulere Prison in Ondo West council area of Ondo State after being charged with arson, riotous assembly, stealing and malicious damage. Kemisola reportedly went into labour on June 15 and gave birth the following day. Her lawyer, Tope Tomekun, in a letter to the Ondo Chief Judge, Oluwatoyin Akeredolu, argued that Kemisola was innocent of the crime preferred against her. Tomekun said Kemisola was on her way to the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) to collect money for her mother’s treatment when she was apprehended by soldiers and handed over to the police. “She was later alleged to be part of those who set APC Secretariat Akure on fire during the EndSARS protest that took place in October 2020. Tomekun has appealed for “urgent hearing” of the case “for the sake of the sinless newborn child and in the interest of justice”. He also appealed to the Ondo Commissioner of Justice and Attorney-General Sir Titiloye Charles to discontinue the prosecution of Kemisola and others.
