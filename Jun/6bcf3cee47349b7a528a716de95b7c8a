Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano has cautioned against discrimination against vulnerable persons, including Persons with Albinism (PWA). He noted that those discriminating against them were working against the interest of the state, warning that government would explore every instrument of law to punish culprits. The governor represented by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C-Don Adinuba at a stakeholders’ lunch on Albinism to mark 2021 Albinism Day, Obiano challenged them to have confidence in themselves and not to wallow in self-pity no matter the level of discrimination. He said: “It’s our responsibility to always strive for a more humane society. We must be more caring, that is why Governor Obiano appointed Chidinma, Special Assistant and later promoted her to Senior Special Assistant because of his caring and humane disposition.” Senior Special Assistant on Public Enlightenment, Chidinma Oramali disclosed that about 90,000 people in the state were living with albinism, accounting for three per cent of the three million Nigerians living with the condition. Commissioner for Health, Dr Vincent Okpala, represented by Dr Jude Nguzoro pledged government’s support towards providing visual enhancement aids and special care for people living with the condition.
