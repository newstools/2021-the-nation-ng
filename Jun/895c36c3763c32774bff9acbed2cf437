Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule has sought further intervention from the Federal Government to enable the state to generate 50 megawatts of power, from Farin Ruwa Dam, in Wamba Local Government Area. Governor Sule sought the assistance of the Federal Government during the flag-off ceremony for the completion work on the Farin Ruwa Dam, initiated during the administration of Senator Abdullahi Adamu, by the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu at the weekend in Wamba Local Government Area. The governor requested the Ministry of Water Resources to assist the state towards generating 25 megawatts from the Farin Ruwa Waterfalls and another 25 megawatts at the Farin Ruwa Dam when completed. According to him, the entire Nasarawa State requires only about 10 megawatts of power, with the remaining 40 megawatts to be generated and uploaded to the National Grid to power the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Minister of Water Resources Suleiman Adamu said President Muhammadu Buhari approved of the takeover of the Farin Ruwa Earth Dam project, from the Nasarawa State government in 2018.
