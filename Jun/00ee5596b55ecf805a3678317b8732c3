Gunmen, suspected to be herdsmen, last Sunday invaded Akaleku village in Obi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State killing one Yahaya Yunusa at a relaxation spot. The gunmen equally kidnapped the proprietor of the relaxation spot, Emmanuel Ojoghi, alongside his 22 years old daughter, Comfort, and whisked both of them away to an unknown destination through the Akaleku Sidi road. An eyewitness account told our correspondent that the incident occurred at about 9pm of that fateful night when three suspected herdsmen arrived at the relaxation spot on the pretext of relaxation when they ordered some drinks. “But unknowingly, the herdsmen concealed in their cloaks AK47 riffles and stationed some of their members in strategic position when they suddenly brought out their guns after about 15 minutes of their pretended relaxation and shot sporadically while the locals scamper for their lives. “It was in the process of the sporadic shooting that a bullet hit Yayaya Yunusa and was rushed to the hospital but gave up his ghost, after the herdsmen had kidnapped the owner of the relaxation spot, Ojoghi, with his daughter, Comfort,” the eyewitness reported. Our correspondent also gathered that a similar incident occurred at Sarkin Noma, a village in Keana Local Government Area of the state, where an Igbo businessman was kidnapped about three days ago by the same suspected Fulani herdsmen. When contacted, the Nasarawa State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Ramhan Nansel, said the incident was yet to be reported to the command.
