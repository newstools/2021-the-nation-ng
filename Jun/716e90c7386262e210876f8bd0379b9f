Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has decried the lack of progress in the economic diversification drive of the Federal Government, describing the situation as unhealthy for the economic development of the country. He stated this on Tuesday at the Government House, Makurdi when he received a team from the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) led by Alhaji Shuaibu Abdullahi Yaman. Governor Ortom, who was represented by his Deputy Benson Abounu,  expressed sadness that despite several pronouncements by the government, the diversification of the economy has remained an illusion. He stated that in the diversification of the economy, urgent attention must be given to the security situation in the country. He said Nigerians must rise up and take action against the AK-47- wielding Fulani herdsmen have entered into the country from neighbouring countries to cause mayhem in Nigeria. Governor Ortom called on the RMAFC to overhaul the distribution of the country’s commonwealth to favour the states and local governments, adding that it was wrong for the Federal Government with limited responsibilities to be taken over 52 per cent of the country’s revenue, while the states and local governments, which have more responsibilities and where the people reside are made to share what remains, after taking away derivation. The leader of the delegation, Alhaji Abdullahi Yaman said they were in the state to assess the progress that Benue State had made in the diversification of the economy. He explained that the Constitution mandates the Commission to advise federal and state governments on fiscal efficiency and means by which their revenue can be increased. He called on the state government to increase its internally generated revenue.
