Manchester United are reportedly considering making Paul Pogba the highest-paid player in the Premier League as they look to tie the Frenchman down. Pogba has entered the final year of his current deal at Old Trafford, worth £300,000-a-week, and his club are keen to prevent him from going into the new season with his future still uncertain. According to The Sun, this means offering him an incredible new £400,000-a-week contract over the next five years to convince the midfielder to stay in Manchester. This would see the structure of the deal agreed once Pogba returns from the Euros later this summer, with the 28-year-old commenting last week his focus was on his country. “I have one year left on my contract, everyone knows that,” Pogba said in a press conference. ‘There have been no concrete proposals for extensions. I’m still in Manchester. “After the season there was the vacation, so I didn’t sit down with the managers and coach. I’m focused on the Euro.” It’s likely to take a monster offer to persuade Pogba to commit his future to the club, as he would be in a position to demand a massive signing on fee alongside huge wages should he wait it out to leave on a free transfer. Over recent years it has seemed on more than one occasion that a departure was likely, with Pogba’s agent Mino Raiola at times appearing to try and publicly force a move. In December, Raiola was definite in his assessment of his client’s future at United with reported interest from Juventus and Real Madrid.
