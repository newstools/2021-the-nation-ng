The Catholic Church has banned Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministries Enugu Nigeria (AMEN) Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka from commenting on partisan politics. The Nation learnt this ban is coming after the controversy surrounding the recent disappearance and appearance of the fiery Catholic Priest, which also led to the shutdown of his Adoration Ministry. In a copy of the letter to Mbaka obtained by The Nation, the Catholic bishop of Enugu Diocese Callistus Onaga announced the conversion of the Adoration Ministry to ‘chaplaincy’. The letter dated June 3 contains the diocesan directives and guidelines for the conduct of the adoration ministry. It also explained that Mbaka still leads the chaplaincy but the bishop (Onaga) can appoint any ministerial officer “to assist the chaplains to oversee the pastoral activities of the ministry.”
