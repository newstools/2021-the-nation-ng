 Super Eagles star Moses Simon has expressed his relief after Nantes secured their top-flight status following their two-legged playoff against Toulouse. Les Canaries finished 18th  in the Ligue 1 and had to play Toulouse in a two-legged playoff for a chance to stay in the top-flight. Antoine Kombouaré’s men just managed to do that, edging out Ligue 2 side on away goals rule. Nantes won the first leg away from home 2-1 before losing the return leg 1-0. Simon played a part in the two games, and he could not hide his excitement after the team secured their top-flight status. The Nigerian international took to his Twitter account to express his delight but admitted there’s much work to do ahead of next season. “The journey was rocky, but we gave our all to remain in Ligue 1,” Simon said in a Twitter post. “There’s more to work and improve on as a team, together we can make the change.” “Endless love and thanks to the fans that didn’t stop believing in us when it looked uncertain. We love and appreciate you all.” Nantes form in the just-concluded also affected Simon’s performances. The Super Eagles star could not build on his impressive debut season at the club, scoring just six goals and registering five assists in 33 Ligue 1 matches.
