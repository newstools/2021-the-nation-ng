The Attorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) on Tuesday deactivated his Twitter account. This move is in solidarity with the Federal Government’s suspension of the operations of the micro blogging and social networking service, Twitter. The Nation reports Malami had last week given directives concerning prosecuting Nigerians flouting the Twitter suspension by using the Virtual Private Networks to access their accounts. Minister of Information and Tourism, Lai Mohammed had announced the “indefinite” suspension in a statement last week by his spokesman Segun Adeyemi. Similarly, the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) also ordered broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts. Malami, who took to his Facebook page on Tuesday, posted a photo and a caption which reads: “My Twitter account deactivated’.  His post received over 1,000 comments with mixed reactions, many of his Facebook followers asked him how he accessed Twitter to delete his account. The President’s wife, Aisha Buhari, also deactivated her Twitter account last week.
