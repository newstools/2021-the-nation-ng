Operatives have killed five hoodlums who attempted another attack on Imo Police Headquarters on Sunday. A suspected leader of the gang identified as Dragon was also arrested during the attack. The Nation had reported hoodlums on April 5 attacked the Command headquarters with explosives, destroying several vehicles while over 600 detainees were freed. But they suffered heavy casualties during the latest attack on the headquarters. Imo Police spokesman, Bala Elkana, said that Dragon and his gang were repelled before they could assess the Command headquarters. According to him: “They made efforts to access the Police Headquarters through Works Layout around Avan Nursery and Primary School but were vehemently repelled. “They came in a white Hummer bus. Five of the hoodlums were killed during an exchange of fire and others were injured. The Hummer bus is recovered. Four Ak47 rifles were also recovered.” He added: “We have unmasked the unknown gunmen today. The gang leader dreaded Dragon has been captured alive and he has made a useful statement that will end the idea of unknown gunmen terrorising the state.”
