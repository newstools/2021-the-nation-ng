 Super Eagles new boy Terem Moffi is confident that the national team will bounce back from their first leg defeat to Cameroon. Fulham midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa scored the only goal of the encounter to ensure his side secured victory in Austria. The Super Eagles had a number of scoring chances in the game but were unable to find the back of the net and Moffi, who replaced Paul Onuachu in the second half of that encounter to make his international bow, expects a victory over Nigeria’s long term rivals. The teams will go head to head once more on Tuesday for another friendly match as they prepare for the 2022 World Cup Qualifiers later in the year and the  African Cup of Nations which begins early next year. “I expect that we will win,”the Lorient star told NationSports. “In the first match we made about twenty attempts at goal with six on target but failed to score. Cameroon had six attempts and the only one on target resulted in a goal. We got punished for not taking our chances. “I do not expect lightning to strike a second time against us. We will play to win,” he added.
