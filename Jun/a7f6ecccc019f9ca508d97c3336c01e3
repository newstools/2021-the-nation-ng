Veteran Nollywood actress, Idowu ‘Iya Rainbow’ Phillips has revealed how the actress and comedienne Princess turned a deaf ear to her advice in order to settle the child molestation case against Baba Ijesha. According to the 78-year-old actress, she reached out to Princess to amicably resolve the case out of court. She made this revelation during an interview with BBC Yoruba, saying that presently Baba Ijesha has been granted bail as the case has been escalated. “I asked the princess for four days not to take the matter to court. I urged her not to let this matter get louder, but she refused. Now, see how the whole thing played out,” she said. The Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State-born actress, however, prayed for peace to reign among both parties.
