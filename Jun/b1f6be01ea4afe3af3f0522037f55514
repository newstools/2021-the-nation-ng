Former Governor of Cross River State and a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress APC in Nigeria, Mr. Clement Ebri says the defection of Governor Ben Ayade to the All Progressives Congress is the hand of God in the politics of the state and he will devote every ounce of his energy to help him succeed. Governor Ayade has served for six years since he was elected under the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) but he defected to the governing APC last month, citing needs to align with the governing party of the Federal Government. Speaking in an exclusive interview with The Nation in Calabar, former Governor Ebri described the defection of Governor Ayade to the APC as a divine intervention for the state and pledged to help the governor achieve his goals within the remaining two years of his tenure. His words, “I see the hand of God in what happened. It was a master stroke.” He maintained that the defection of Ayade has significantly altered the dynamics of politics in the state. According to Ebri, “the APC in Cross River State has now assumed a new character with the membership of Governor Ayade. He called on the party members in the state to understand that this is their best chance and they must utilise it appropriately.
