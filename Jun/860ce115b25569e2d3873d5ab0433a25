KARIM Benzema was asked about Kylian Mbappe and the rumours linking the striker to Real Madrid. “If he came to Real, that would be ideal,” he replied. “All great players want to come to Real one day so I hope it will happen quickly, if he wants to leave PSG that is, they are a good team too.”  Fans have already spotted that the two are communicating closely with each other on international duty. As a reminder, the 22-year-old has only 1 year left on his deal and it’s believed that he’s decided not to extend his contract with the Ligue 1 side and move to Madrid.
