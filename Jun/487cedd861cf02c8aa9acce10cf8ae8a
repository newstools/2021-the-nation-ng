Home-based Super Eagles captain Ikechukwu Ezenwa has assured Nigerians that the team would give its best against Mexico in the high profile friendly game on July 4 at the Los Angeles Coliseum in the USA. The home-based Eagles had their first training session at the Goal Project, Package B of the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja under the watchful eyes of   coach Pau Aigbogun and Nigeria Football Federation Technical Director Austin Eguavoen. German coach Gernot Rohr was in the milieu with NFF Secretary General Dr. Sanusi  Muhammed   to watch the morning session. Meanwhile, a confident Ezenwa is upbeat: “We are looking forward to the game against Mexico in Los Angeles next week. It is a privilege to represent 200 million Nigerians; we just have to give our best to make the country proud.” He continued: “It is not easy meeting for the first time. Some are new to the national set-up but the most important thing is having that solidarity and coming together. As captain of the side, it is my job to bring them together so that we can perform the task ahead.” Also the team’s goalkeeper trainer Alloy Agu believes the form of the invited goalkeepers were encouraging, adding that Enyimba’s John Noble is expected to join the team  as soon as possible. “The first training session with the goalkeepers was very positive,” Agu said. “They have been playing in the league and we expected them to showcase their form here and that is precisely what they have been doing.” He added: “Ezenwa is here and two other goalkeepers, we are still expecting John Noble to join the team soon.”
