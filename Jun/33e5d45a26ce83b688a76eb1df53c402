A youth leader and founder of  ‘Not Too Young To Rule Initiative’ in River State, Boma Banigo, has lauded the achievement of the state governor,  Nyesom Wike in developing infrastructure in the last six years in office. Banigo, who spoke while assessing the activities of the current government of the state ahead of Democracy Day celebration on Saturday, June 12, described Governor Wike as a focused and result oriented leader whose unprecedented infrastructural development prowess is almost second to none, in the state and the best in the country. He however urged the governor to also pay attention in the areas of human and agricultural developments as a way of striking a balance in the passion to transform the state’s landscape. Speaking to The Nation in Port Harcourt, yesterday, the young Banigo said: “The people of Rivers state sincerely appreciate God for giving us such a great governor in Governor Nyesom Wike. He is the second best governor Rivers State has ever produced after ex-governor Peter Odili, and the best in Nigeria today. “This is the second year into his second tenure in office, yet we can still see him completing and executing other projects and initiating new ones, this is not usual with politicians, I feel safe to say, he is performing well. We believe this tempo will be sustained. “I would rate him high in terms of infrastructural development; however,  Rivers people would like to see more human capital development, youths and students’ welfare and agricultural development to ensure food security to complement the great work he is doing in the area of infrastructural development,” he said.
