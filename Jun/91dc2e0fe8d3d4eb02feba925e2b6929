VersionFlex, an indigenous company, is set to redefine online transportation and logistics service delivery, especially e-hailing in Nigeria and West Africa. VersionFlex said it would consider the prevailing economic situations of Nigerians in both the availability and affordability of its products and services. The main drive and priority of the *Start Up* is geared towards mass employment and citizens empowerment. Spokesperson of the company, Mr. Olusola Amosu, said the priority of the start-up firm is geared towards mass employment and empowerment. “We are redefining and repositioning the concept and usage of e-hailing to suit the UNIQUE Nigerian business environments. For too long, Nigerians, who are very mobile, have been taken for granted and have lost so much resources and manpower/labour hours to inadequacies of  transportation services. We will strive to provide good rides, attractive incentives and quality services. Our niche is to make it affordable! It is going to be affordable, dependable and available,” he said. Amosu disclosed that VersionFlex is already partnering to make available a variety of vehicles according to increasing needs of every customer in social, political and economic cadre of the society, with attendant liberty to choose while the drivers are trained to be courteous and respectful. “VersionFlex has packaged some unique features and perquisites which include a sizeable discount on first-time users, optional savings plan and a zero percent commission for a reasonable period for drivers,” enthused Amosu.
