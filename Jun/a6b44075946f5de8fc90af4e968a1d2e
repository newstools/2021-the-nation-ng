The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board on Thursday said 160,617 candidates sat for the 2021 mock Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). The examination, which took place in 777 computer-based test centres across the country, was to prepare the candidates and familiarise them with the systems ahead of the main UTME on June 19. During the monitoring of the exercise at Global Distance Learning, Abuja, JAMB’s Head of Media and Protocol, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, told reporters at the end of the exercise that the essence of the mock exam was to test the capacity and suitability of the centres. He said that the exercise conducted nationwide was hitch-free, except in Dominion International School, Jabi, Abuja where the centre was gutted by fire and candidates were redirected to other centres. Benjamin said: “We have over 160,617 candidates sitting for this mock examination in all our CBT centres. We received a report of complaint of the capacity and stability of one or two centres. “Like in Abuja, there is a centre- Dominion International School, Jabi that caught fire during the examinations but everything has been put under control.” According to him, JAMB is adequately prepared for the main UTME which is due to take place between June 19 and July 3, 2021, going by the success of the mock exam. “The exams are going on well and with what we have now, it shows we are good to go for the main examinations coming up June 19,” he said.
