Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has warned that rising violence in Zamfara State is now causing a humanitarian crisis. It therefore wants an urgent response to help the victims after treating thousands of children for acute malnutrition, measles, malaria and other conditions. The MSF in a statement on Friday called for urgent support for people said to be desperately short of food, drinking water, shelter, protection and basic services, including healthcare. MSF said people have been forced to flee their homes, farms and grazing lands due to escalating violence. Armed bandits operating in the state and neighbouring Katsina and Niger regularly attack communities and kidnap villagers – many of them for ransom.
