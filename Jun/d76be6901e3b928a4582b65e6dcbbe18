Wales captain Gareth Bale is unfazed by his team’s underdog status ahead of their Euro 2020 last-16 clash against Denmark today. Wales finished runners-up to Italy in Group A with a mixed return from their three group stage fixtures (W1, D1, L1) to reach the European Championships knockout phase for the second tournament running. The Dragons reached the semi-finals at Euro 2016, going down 2-0 to eventual winners Portugal as they hope to emulate similar success this summer. Rob Page’s team will have to overcome Denmark, who became the first nation in Euro history to make it out of the group stage after losing their opening two games of the tournament. Danish Dynamite lost their headline performer Christian Eriksen for the rest of the competition after the Inter Milan playmaker collapsed on the pitch during their Matchday 1 showdown against Finland. “That is normal anyway,” the Real Madrid superstar told Sky Sports in the build-up to the match. We are always the underdogs and used to that tag. It does not make a difference to us.” Bale also stated the Wales camp had offered their support to Eriksen and praised the way Denmark coped with the unfortunate situation. “Obviously, we understand the situation that happened with them, and we have sent all our best wishes to Christian,” he continued.
