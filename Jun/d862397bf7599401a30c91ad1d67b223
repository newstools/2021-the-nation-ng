The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has cautioned importers, distributors, healthcare professionals against the importation, distribution and sale of COVID-19 test kits from Peru. The Director-General of the agency, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, gave the caution in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday.

The director-general stressed that the test kits did not meet the required IgG specificity and IgM sensitivity standards. She said that the Peruvian Directorate of Medicines, Supplies and Drugs (DIGIMED), had ordered the recall of the defective COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test kit.
