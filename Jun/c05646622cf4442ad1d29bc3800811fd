The Senate, on Wednesday, received President Muhammadu Buhari’s executive Bill which seeks to increase the retirement age for teachers in the country from 60 to 65 years. The Bill also proposes increase in the years of service for teachers from 35 to 40 years. Buhari, in a letter read on the floor by Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, noted that the Bill provides for harmonised retirement age for teachers in the country. According to him, the move to increase the retirement age and service years of teachers was pursuant to Section 58(2) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). Buhari’s letter titled: “Transmission of the harmonised retirement age for Teachers in Nigeria Bill 2021 to the National Assembly for consideration,” reads: “Pursuant to Section 58 subsection 2 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), I forward herewith the harmonised retirement age for teachers in Nigeria Bill, 2021 for consideration by the Senate. “The harmonised retirement age for teachers in Nigeria Bill 2021 seeks to increase the retirement age for teachers from 60 to 65 years, and also increase the possible years of service from 35 to 40 years. “While appreciating your usual expeditious consideration of this submission, please, accepts Distinguished Senate President, the assurances of my highest consideration.” Meanwhile, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, during plenary referred the President’s request for the confirmation of Major General Farouk Yahaya as Chief of Army Staff of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the Committees on Defense and Army for further legislative work. The Senate Committee on Defence, chaired by Senator Aliyu Wamakko, was named the lead Committee to screen the newly appointed Army Chief. It would be recalled that Buhari had in October 2020 approved a special salary scale and new retirement age for teachers in commemoration of the World Teachers Day.
