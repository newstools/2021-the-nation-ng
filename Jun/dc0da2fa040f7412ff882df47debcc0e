One of the sympathisers, Jackson Ovie-Johnson, described the late Joshua as ‘a practical Jesus’. He said: “The late prophet was my mentor and spiritual father. He knows my face spiritually and physically. It was he who reconciled me with my wife when my marriage collapsed after 21 years. “My father has gone to heaven, just like Elijah, and I am not surprised because he always preached in parables. Just yesterday, I was watching him perform miracles and then he said there is time for everything but people didn’t understand him. “I just want to hear his voice. He is an example, a practical Jesus Christ in the physical for my generation.” Fatima Badru, who resides and owns a shop in the area, described the deceased as generous to a fault. According to her, the late Prophet Joshua did well to everyone around. She said: “The late prophet did well to everyone around. We enjoyed great security of our goods and property because of him. Whenever you meet him, you are sure of getting something tangible. “We can feed for about four months without buying anything with our money because of the late prophet. We will miss him and pray God to raise another helper for us in his stead.”
