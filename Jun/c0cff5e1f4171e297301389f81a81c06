Record-breaking Bayern Munich star Robert Lewandowski has been recognised by his peers as the Bundesliga’s best player in the 2020/21 season. The 32-year-old set a new single-season best-mark by hitting 41 goals in 29 league matches – one more than former Bayern striker Gerd Müller managed in 1971/72. It comes as no surprise, then, that Lewandowski picked up 75.9 percent of the vote for the Silver Shoe award, which sees members of the players’ union VdV choose the best player of the season. It is the second year in a row and fifth time in total that the reigning world player of the year got the top prize, with Erling Haaland (7.1 percent) and Thomas Müller (3.5 percent) next in line in the voting.  Poland captain Lewandowski and Germany attacker Müller were among seven Bayern players who were named on to the team of the season. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, defenders Alphonso Davies and David Alaba and midfielders Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka also represent the champions. New Bayern signing Dayot Upamecano made the team after helping RB Leipzig end as runners-up, while fellow centre-back Mats Hummels also made the cut. Hummels was one of two Borussia Dortmund players voted onto the team, with Haaland also included after scoring 27 goals in 28 Bundesliga matches. Eintracht Frankfurt winger Filip Kostic completed the line-up. Dortmund and England midfielder Jude Bellingham (24.1 percent of the vote) won the Silver Arrow award for the best young player, edging out Bayern and Germany teenager Jamal Musiala (19.9 percent). Bayer Leverkusen’s rising star Florian Wirtz was third in that category.
