The people of Agu – Amaede community in Eha-Amufu town, Isi-Uzo Council Area of Enugu State have cried out over incessant kidnapping of their kinsmen by suspected herdsmen. The assailants struck last week, kidnapping  seven villagers, including a woman and two teenage boys in the community. They were reported to have killed one of the victims, said to be a commercial motorcyclist and collected some ransom before setting their captives free after three days in captivity. Speaking with journalists after the home and abroad members of the community emerged from a two-day emergency meeting following the kidnapping of seven persons from the community, the National Vice President, Agu- Amaede Development Union, Mr. Ogenyi Donatus, said the community had been seriously troubled by the incessant kidnapping of their kinsmen by hoodlums masquerading as herdsmen. He said: “Since the activities of the herdsmen started here, our people can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed. We have been living in panic. “We returned home after hearing what happened and resolved to proffer solutions to this incessant kidnapping of our people “Our people are in distress. That’s why we’re happy that you journalists came to hear from us. We cannot sleep in our place again. The worst is that we cannot go to our farms anymore. Our people are mainly farmers. It has been a terrible experience for us. “There’s a way we live here in this community. Majority of our people settle in the farms and return home once in a while and a few others live in the village centers. That farm settlement is where the herders are rearing their farms.”
