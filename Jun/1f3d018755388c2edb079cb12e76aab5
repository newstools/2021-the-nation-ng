The Police Command in Lagos said it had rearrested one Oyemachi Maduabuchi who escaped from the Owerri Correctional Centre in Imo. According to a statement signed by the Police Spokesperson in Lagos, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, Maduabuchi, who escaped after a jailbreak on April 5, was re-arrested on April 23, in Lagos. Adejobi said Maduabuchi fled Owerri the same day and moved to his village, Fegge in Onitsha, Anambra, to meet his mother who later linked him up with his elder sister, Amarachi of Customs Bus Stop Ijegun Lagos. He said that the said sister later invited him to Lagos on April 19. “The suspect was kept in the sister’s house where she used to lead him to church for special deliverance service. “In the process, after the night vigil on April 20, at Bride Assembly Church, Ijesha Area of Lagos State, the suspect allegedly stole the Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) and the memory cards of a member of the church. “He was eventually arrested and the stolen items recovered from him. “In the course of the police investigation, it was revealed that the suspect has been standing trial since 2009 for Conspiracy, Armed Robbery and Arson before Justice Nna Amadi of Mgbidi High Court 1, in Imo,” he said. The PPRO said Maduabuchi had confessed to the crime while Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Hakeem Odumosu had directed that he be handed over to the Nigerian Correctional Service for further investigation and necessary action. “The Commissioner of Police, therefore, assured the general public that the command will not relent on its efforts in making the state safe and peaceful for all and sundry to live in,” Adejobi added. He said that the Commissioner wished that as all hands were on deck to effectively police Lagos State. (NAN)
