Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has said more governors elected under other political parties’ platforms have expressed willingness to defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Ganduje said this when he hosted members of APC Membership Registration/Revalidation Appeals Committee, led by Alhaji Faruk Aliyu, during a visit at the Governor’s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja. A statement yesterday in Kano by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Abba Anwar, quoted Ganduje as saying APC was making arrangements to receive the governors who would join the party for a greater Nigeria.  He hailed the membership registration/ revalidation committee for doing a successful job. “As far as we are concerned, nobody was marginalised in the exercise. For your information, there are indications that more governors are coming to our great party, the APC, from other places. Our internal democracy is waxing stronger day by day. “I want to use this opportunity to congratulate you for getting us more entrants into our party. We thank you for the good exercise conducted. This makes our party to wax stronger and improve internal democracy,” he said.
