Fear has gripped residents of Tunga Maje village near Zuba in Abuja over the kidnap of Hon. Friday Sani Makama, Prince Frederick Adejoh and others yet-to-be identified from their Hilltop Hotel lodge. Makama, a former lawmaker in the Kogi Assembly, recently defected from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) while Prince Adejoh is the Oma Onu Aya of Igala land. Eyewitnesses said armed men shot sporadically into the air, causing security guards to scamper for safety before whisking away guests and owner of the hotel. Tunga Maje and the notorious Kaduna-Abuja highway has been a den for kidnappers and hoodlums. The management of the hotel, according to findings, has reported the incident to the police. Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Police spokesperson, ASP Mariam Yusuf, who confirmed the incident, noted the Command has launched manhunt on the abductors. According to her: “The Command has launched a strategic operation to rescue the victims unhurt.” Findings also revealed that joint security operatives have started serious search to fish out the perpetrators.
