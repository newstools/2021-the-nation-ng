A Yaba Chief Magistrate Court has denied Nollywood actor Omiyinka Olanrewaju popularly known as Baba Ijesha bail, setting the stage for his trial at the High Court on charges bothering on rape, sexual assault and abuse of a minor. Mr P.E Nwaka, turned down Baba Ijesha’s application for bail on the ground that the same charge is already before a Lagos State High Court. He said: “I have carefully considered the application of the counsel to the defendant seeking bail for the defendant and the opposition by the counsel from the DPP. “Since there are indications that the matter is before the High Court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given. “The defendant must be accorded full medical attention by the authorities pending his arraignment at the high court,” the Magistrate said. Mr Nwaka adjourned the matter till July 13 for mention. Confirming the Chief Magistrate’s assumption, a source in the Ministry of Justice said the file is already before the High Court. “We are only waiting for the case to be transferred so that we can know the exact judge that will handle the matter,” the source said.
