Alté singer Temilade Openiyi aka Tems has opened up on her performance on Wizkid’s popular song “Essence.” “Essence” is off Wizkid’s buzzing ‘Made In Lagos’ Album. The song has created a massive rave in the music industry and has been topping music charts since it was released. According to the fast-rising artist, she didn’t do enough on the track and believed she could have done better. In a recent interview, Tems disclosed when she did the first recording, she had wanted to polish it more to sound better as she wasn’t really impressed but Starboy’s team insisted that it was okay and did not accord her the opportunity to redo her verse. The leading Vibe Limited signee said: “Even on the day I recorded my verse on the song, I felt I could do better. I asked them to send me the beat again so I could redo my verse but Wizkid’s team said it was great. “I told them I still wanted to ‘top it’ but they did not let me. However, I was happy with it. I always like to challenge myself and I used to be such a perfectionist. Wizkid also said he liked it.” When asked about how she felt when a video of Kylie Jenne, an American socialite and billionaire was seen singing along to Essence, Tems described her feeling as ‘good’. She said: “That was good. When I was in Los Angeles, I was hearing the song in the most random places. I did not even know that people there knew the song. It was quite an experience.” Wizkid and Tems had featured on former US president, Barack Obama’s list of favourite music of 2020.
