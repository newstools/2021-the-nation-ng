Oyo State Government and a group, Clean Up Nigeria, comprising volunteers from bodies such as Young African Leaders Initiative, Epower, Social Sugar, Planet 3R, African Creative Synergy Hub, Recycla and National Institute of Environmental Engineers, with the support of the United States Consulate, have embarked on the cleaning of the Mokola axis of Ibadan, to create awareness for a cleaner environment. The environmentalists and government officials trooped out, bearing posters with inscriptions such as  ‘Cleaner cities, healthier citizens’, ‘Be part of the solution, not the pollution,’ and ‘Where are the brooms, where are the parkers, where is your voice’. Addressing the clean-up volunteers and declaring the World Environment Day open in the state, Environment and Natural Resources Commissioner Dr. Abdullateef Oyeleke, accompanied by the Special Adviser to Governor Seyi Makinde on Environmental Matters, Mr Ademola Aderinto and other officials from the ministry, urged residents to contribute to the cleaning- up of the environment. Olugbenga Ogunbowale, one of the conveners of the exercise, said the campaign was also held in Rivers, Enugu and Lagos states. Jumoke Olowookere, the director of African Creative Synergy Hub, said: “It is important for people to take responsibility for the waste they generate and also how they dispose them.”
