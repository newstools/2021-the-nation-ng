 A Mediation Advocate, Mr Valentino Buoro, says mediation has helped to resolve many broken marriages that were on the verge of divorce. Buoro made the assertion in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Sunday. NAN reports that mediation is a procedure in which the parties discuss their disputes with the assistance of a trained impartial third person(s) who assists them in reaching a settlement. He said: “Mediation cannot reduce the rising cases of divorce in our society; rather the economical, religious and social values of the people can do so. “Mediation can only give a soft landing to the parties if they must divorce. “Divorce may be encouraged if there is a threat to life; otherwise, marriage like every other aspect of life experiences ups and downs which can be fixed.” According to him, at mediation, parties have the ability to express themselves well which the normal court processes might not allow and the mediation process is done in private. “At the end, some couples come out of the mediation process holding hands,” Buoro added. He, however, explained that the court was the only arbiter that could pronounce the divorce. The mediation expert advised couples who had filed for divorce to ask the court to stay proceedings to enable them to explore the mediation process. He said: “In mediation, dirty linen can be washed between the parties and the mediator but not in the public eye. “There is confidentiality in the mediation process and issues are resolved in private. “The court might have little or nothing to resolve after the mediation process has been explored. “The cost of exploring mediation is cheaper and mediation assists families to divorce in a respectable manner,” Buoro.
