Relatives of a 55-year-old woman, Joke Olaniji, have found her corpse two weeks after she was declared missing. The decomposing corpse was found at a cocoa farm that is two hours away from her residence at Atoyo area, Ondo East Local Government Area of Ondo State. Sources said late Joke left the house without telling anybody where she was going. She was said to have left the door to her room opened including her phone. Her mother, Julianna, said she thought her daughter went to buy gala when she returned home from a meeting and didn’t find her at home. “Around 3:30pm, when I was coming from the meeting, I saw somebody coming out of our house. She told me that she could not find Joke in the house, as she wanted to buy nylon. “I became worried and quickly ran home to call people’s attention to help me look for my daughter because she went out in the morning without telling me where she was going. “When we could not trace her, we informed the police and went to other places to pray so that she could come home. But we did not see her until police called that her body had been found naked in one cocoa farm, very close to our area.” Juliana urged the police to help unravel what happened to her daughter and arrest the perpetrators. It was learnt that the remains of Joke has since been buried. Ondo Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, could not be reached for comments but Police sources said no suspect has been arrested.
