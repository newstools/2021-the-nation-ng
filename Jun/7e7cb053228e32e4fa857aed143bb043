 Rated number two in the women’s 57kg freestyle, Nigeria’s Odunayo Adekuoroye has been considered as one of the favourites for the title at Poland Open which kicks off today in Warsaw. According to United World Wrestling (UWW), Adekuoroye, who is Africa’s first-ever women’s wrestling world finalist has been described as the biggest American Olympic champion Helen Maroulis. The star-studded 57kg is loaded with 17 wrestlers which include two Olympic medalists, five world medal winners, and seven continental champions. UWW stated that Maroulis will have that opportunity to lace up her boots against the world’s best at 57kg – including Olympic runner-up Valeria Koblova of Russia and world medalist Iryna Kurachkina of Belarus as well as Adekuoroye. On paper, Adekuoroye would be the biggest threat to Maroulis’ shot at winning Ranking Series gold in Warsaw. But, after being sidelined for over 16 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, two-time world bronze medalist Iryna Kurachkina takes the top spot as Maroulis’s biggest threat. “If Adekuoroye and Maroulis happen to meet, it wouldn’t be the first meeting between the two superstars. The pair wrestled in an exhibition in New York City at the ’18 Beat the Street. The American scored the matches only takedown, shut down the Nigerian’s offense, and eased her way to a 4-1 win,” states UWW.
