Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, is not a happy man as we speak. Sentry gathered that the incessant attacks on communities and towns in the Ibarapa area of the state is the major headache he’s currently battling. Beyond worries that the insecurity in the area is getting out of hand, the governor is daily reminded that his performance in office may be judged by how he handles the Ibarapa situation. “This is worrying him to no end. He is displeased that as much as he is trying to save the situation, recent developments and the realities on ground are not helping his case. He is the governor, yes, but what more can he do than he is doing in the circumstance? But his critics are not ready to hear this,’ a source said. During a recent visit to the area, the governor gave an inkling of his frustration when he said: “I urge you to give me that chance to make the issue of insecurity here become a thing of the past. Don’t take laws into your hands. I believe there are certain things we put in place, which we think would work; but unfortunately, they did not work. Please, give me some time, everything will be resolved. Please, give us the opportunity to resolve this and make this place better for you,” he said.
