The Sosan Adalemo and Deyoruwa families as well as Messrs Tesleem Adewuyi and Femi Alabi yesterday sought the help of Ogun State Police Commissioner to recover their parcels of land in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area. They alleged that six acres in Majo Village, off Awoo Road, via Orilemo Village, had been seized by armed thugs allegedly sponsored by a rival family and a company. In a June 15 petition by their lawyer and Principal Partner of Citipoint LP, Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika (SAN), the petitioners claimed that the thugs “bearing charms, machetes, guns and other dangerous weapons” destroyed the crops on their land. They traced the land grab to December 2019, adding that following a meeting at the palace of the Bale of Orilemo Village, community elders who were familiar with the boundaries of the farmlands in dispute confirmed that the lands belonged to the petitioners. The legitimate owners of properties, they said, were being “harassed, intimidated and beaten up” by the thugs, adding that this had caused insecurity in the once peaceful community. According to the petitioners, they and those farming on the land had been warned “not to come near their parcels of farmland, otherwise they will be dealt with mercilessly”. The petitioners said they and their workers, who depend on their parcels of farmland for their livelihood, were worried about the safety of their lives, properties and investments. They said they had found themselves in a situation where an agricultural company and the family had assumed the positions of the “executive, judiciary and legislative” functions, all in an attempt to drive away the legitimate owners from their farmlands. “We hereby humbly call on you, sir, to come to the aid of the petitioners by inviting and interviewing the parties and that if this petition is found to be credible, then your office should initiate appropriate criminal charges against the land grabbers,” they told the police commissioner.
