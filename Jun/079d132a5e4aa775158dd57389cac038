The Super Eagles are still sweating on the fitness of defender Jamilu Collins for tomorrow’s rematch against Cameroon even after coach Gernot Rohr ruled him out of the game. Paderborn left back Collins is nursing an ankle injury and SCORENigeria has now gathered today’s training will determine if he could still feature in Tuesday’s rematch. Stand-in captain William Ekong is certainly out due to injury to worsen the defensive crisis now facing Rohr in Austria. Late call-up Anthony Izuchukwu could well make his Eagles debut tomorrow  on account of the growing problems in the team’s defence. Meanwhile, Galatasaray defender Valentine Ozornwafor looks set to partner Chidozie Awaziem in the heart of the Super Eagles back four in Tuesday’s rematch between Super Eagles and Cameroon. Former Flying Eagles star Ozornwafor, 22, made his long-awaited Eagles debut Friday in the first friendly against Cameroon as a late sub. However, in the absence of stand-in captain William Ekong, who was injured in the first Cameroon game, the left-footed Ozornwafor will now get a big chance to stake a claim for a place in the squad ahead of 2022 World Cup qualifiers in September. His call-up for the matches against Cameroon came as a big surprise given that he did not see much action for Galatasaray this past season. He clocked only eight minutes in his only appearance in the Turkish league for ‘Gala’ this past season.
