The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has hailed Wednesday’s Court of Appeal judgement describing it as an affirmation of the people’s decision. It congratulated Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and his Deputy, Hon. Lucky Ayedatiwa, on their victory at the appellate Court. Chairman of the State Caretaker Committee, Engr. Ade Adetimehin, in a statement, decried what he termed “legal distraction”. Adetinmehin accused the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) of plunging the State into an unnecessary distraction. Adetimehin urged the governorship candidate of the PDP, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, to consider the interest of the state and suspend further legal actions. He invited Jegede to join the APC owing to the number of factories built across the state to trigger economic activities. “The Akeredolu-led government needs to remain focused on its patriotic zeal to develop the State and the people. This calls for the support of all, including leaders of opposing parties”, he argued.
