A planned robbery in the Tudun Wada area of Kaduna metropolis has been thwarted. A tipoff on the attack aided police quick deployment in the area on Sunday, thus preventing the armed hoodlums from carrying out the operation, police spokesman Mohammed Jalige said in a statement yesterday. Jalige said 24 rounds of live 7.62 x 39mm ammunition; 30 polymer-cased 12-guage shotgun shells; a Toyota Corolla LE car; a driver’s licence and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards were recovered from the gang. “The hoodlooms, on sighting the police patrol vehicle, started shooting rapidly but the officers…succeeded in repelling the attack,” he said.
