After many months of permutations, allegations, denials, face-offs and resolutions, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the obvious anointed candidate of incumbent Governor Willy Obiano, last Wednesday, emerged candidate of the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State. Soludo scored a total of 740 votes out of 792 valid votes cast by delegates. But that is not the gist. Sentry gathered that with the emergence of Soludo, Obiano has succeeded in forcing his desire on many APGA big guns within and outside the state who had opposed his choice of the retired banker. What is left to be seen is how these bullied and now aggrieved party leaders will react to the alleged imposition and the effect this would have on the party’s performance at the poll. Already the crisis within the party has been deepened with the announcement of the suspension of Soludo from the party by a faction of APGA. A couple of party chieftains have also resolved to challenge his candidacy in court. But Obiano is busy congratulating Soludo for his victory and calling on genuine party faithful to support him. It appears he’s not bothered by the growing noise regarding his exploits with his anointed. Soludo is banking on Obiano and Dr. Victor Oye, national chairman of APGA to calm frayed nerves and bring the party together ahead of the elections. How soon they are able to do this will surely impact on the candidate’s chances in November.
