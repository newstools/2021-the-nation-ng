The Public Transport Owners of Nigeria Association (PTONA), and one of its affiliates, the Association of Luxury Bus Transporters of Nigeria (ALBON), have described the alleged kidnap of passengers travelling on board Young Shall Grow Motors, GUO Transport and Ezenwata luxury buses, as “fake news.” The associations said the ‘news’ was a conjecture that is could upset the peace of the nation, and should, therefore, be disregarded. The Public Relations Officer of PTONA, who doubles as Managing Director/CEO of Rahony Travels Limited, Paul Okoghenun, explained that at no time were buses belonging to the said companies hijacked, explaining that no traveller in any of their vehicles had been kidnapped. Vice President, ALBON, who is the Financial Secretary, PTONA Chief Nonso Ubajaka, said the fake news was the handiwork of mischief-makers. Ubajaka, who is the Executive Director of Izu Chukwu Transport, said he was in touch with the transport firms mentioned in the story, and was, therefore, in a position to confirm that there was no hijack or kidnap incident involving their vehicles. PTONA said: “We believe that the social media post concerning the alleged hijack and kidnap emanated from unscrupulous elements. We, therefore, call on the members of the public to disregard the post and go about their normal businesses. Our customers should be rest assured that we, working with security personnel, are always out to protect their interest.” The managements of Young Shall Grow Motors Limited, GUO Transport and God Bless Ezenwata, have also confirmed that their buses were neither hijacked nor involved in any incidents lately.
