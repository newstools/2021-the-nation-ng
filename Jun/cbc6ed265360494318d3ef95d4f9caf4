BBNaija Lockdown first runner up Dorathy went ballistic over Wathoni’s claim that she was in a relationship with Ozo but failed to admit it. The BBNaija Lockdown housemates gathered for reunion to clear the air and put actions in right perspectives. Wathoni had claimed Dorathy and Ozo shared some moments and insisted that Dorathy was emotionally attached to Ozo but refused to admit it. Dorathy wouldn’t take the claim likely as she got into an altercation with Wathoni when she alleged that Dorathy tried to snatch Ozo from Nengi. The moment had Dorathy calling Wathoni names and insisting she has no reason to interfere in the discussion because she wasn’t involved. This led to sparks flying until Ebuka, the host calmed frayed nerves.
