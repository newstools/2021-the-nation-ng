After teasing the news with a cryptic tweet, Lazio yesterday announced they had hired former Chelsea and Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri. “Maurizio Sarri is the new coach,” posted the Serie A club on social media. Earlier Lazio sent out a tweet showing a hand holding a lit cigarette, track suit tops and a simple drawing of a bank. Sarri, the former Napoli, Chelsea and Juventus coach, worked as a banker and is a notorious chain smoker who wears a track suit on the side-line. Italian media reported that the two sides agreed to a two-year deal earlier in the week. Lazio followed the announcement of the signing with another tweet which they posted on their web site. It said: “Sarrismo…The conception of the game of football advocated by coach Sarri based on speed and attacking propensity.”
