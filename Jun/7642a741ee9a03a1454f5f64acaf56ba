Easyshare.Africa has unveiled Easyshare to enable consumers send and receive money in Africa using crypto technology. Easyshare allows consumers to perform micro-transactions. Co-founder and Head of Partnerships & Community at Easyshare.Africa, Ben Onuoha, said: “Easyshare was borne out of a lot of research. Bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely offered more people access to the global financial system but African consumers have repeatedly told us that Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be way too expensive to use in many cases, and it is therefore, not necessarily the answer for the financial needs of all communities. ‘’More African Bitcoin and Ethereum users are increasingly using other cryptocurrencies which offer better value for money.” Onuoha added: “In response to consumer demand, we are solely focused on the ease of sending and receiving value through cryptocurrency using the most affordable means. Our vision is to bring Decentralised Finance (DeFi) to low and middle income countries where remittances account for five per cent or more of GDP and make these DeFi services more accessible.” Easyshare.Africa is capped at a maximum of US$2,500 per transaction and a minimum of US$1. Users can send money to a mobile wallet or bank account using crypto in five easy steps. Easyshare.Africa supports  cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT ERC20). It also supports other low transaction cost cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT TRC20) and Tron (TRX). Also, Easyshare.Africa is committed to extending its impact, by pioneering the world’s first decentralised network of verified peer to peer crypto-powered remittance agents.
