The world owes this bespectacled bard a garland of coral beads and gold. More than the wag of Wakajaye, he wrenches mirth from melancholy’s mouth and restores reason for the season to wear again, its armour of humour; a world that winks at its spastic saviour on the steady cross of rumour a world of schemed ache and tumour.  I listened to the bard echoing in ancient thoughts and tongues what the baobab says to the forest: Eti roo! “In the clan of peace, election without acrimony is like divorce without alimony”.  When a talkative dove is axed and yanked off its tottering handle the bard pensively shrugs his shoulders and retorts with a plaintive de ja vu: “the burden of ‘Lenbade differs from her daughter’s discomfort ‘Lenbade bemoans Greek gifts neatly wrapped in a ballot box her daughter desires a sweet tweet about trinkets in a bullet box.  Eti roo! as the baobab says to the forest: In the clan of peace, “a bullet is enough for the wise who dares to dig out the royal vice” because no one eats twice at the barn of a bandit”.  In the land of bliss “he who slays the piper must taste the barbecue” and he who sprays the piper. precipitates a major misfortune”.  Eti roo! as the baobab says to the forest: in the land of  ease, uneasy lies the head being barbed with a broken bottle. But come to think of it; when the road is not famished, “Air condition is permanent in a moving tricycle”.
