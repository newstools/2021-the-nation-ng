Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) has reiterated its belief and support for the community-driven development model it adopted some 19 years ago, saying it has fast-tracked development in host communities. CNL’s General Manager, Policy Government and Public Affairs, Mr Esimaje Brikinn, said  this at the 9th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Dodo Rivers Communities Development Association (DRCDA). The AGM, an integral component of the Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) for delivering CNL’s social obligations to its host communities was held on Friday at the Dodo Rivers Secretariat, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. The DRCDA is a community-based organisation established under the GMoU between the Dodo Rivers Communities, the Bayelsa State Government and the CNL. Esimaje, who was represented by the Community Engagement Coordinator, CNL, Bayelsa, Elijah Bikikoro,  congratulated the DRCDA on the AGM. He stated: “The achievements of  the DRCDA reinforce our belief that a process that is community-driven with an effective governance structure can stimulate quicker community development than processes and systems designed without effective participation of community members.” The Chairman DRCDA, Mr Francis Amamogiran, noted that the hallmark of the GMoU lay in the participation of the beneficiaries in the development process in a transparent manner from planning to execution of prioritised projects. “The AGM is in keeping with the transparency and accountability principle embedded in the GMoU. It is an opportunity for the RDC to open its books for the relevant stakeholders to be abreast of its activities and accomplishments,” he stated.
