Zlatan Ibrahimovic knows Jose Mourinho better than most players, from their time together at Inter and Manchester United. The Swede, currently at AC Milan, will go face to face with his former coach next season, who has taken over the reins at AS Roma, and Ibrahimovic is happy that the Portuguese is back in Italy. “It is a great challenge [at Roma]. It will happen to him like [it did with] me, he arrives at a club that are not a favourite and are not used to it,” he told La Gazzetta dello Sport. “For that reason it will be beautiful. On top of that, Mou is a character, everything he says spreads across the world. His arrival] is a good sign for Serie A.”  The Swede guided Milan back to the Champions League and, although they missed out on the Scudetto, Ibrahimovic is happy with how the season went. “Injuries,” was his response when asked what the most frustrating aspect of the season had been. “But since I came back it has been 18 fantastic months. “Milan and their fans deserved Champions League football. “I wanted to win the Scudetto and we were close.”
