Czech Republic took full advantage of a red card for Netherlands defender Matthijs de Ligt, scoring twice after he was sent off to secure a memorable 2-0 win in the last 16 of Euro 2020. De Ligt was given his marching orders after a handball stopped Czech striker Patrik Shick getting in on goal 55 minutes into the game. The referee had initially given De Ligt a yellow, but after consulting the VAR and the pitch-side screen, correctly upgraded it to a straight red. The game had been very level until then, with the Dutch having the lion’s share of the possession, but the Czechs creating the better chances. However, the red card swung the momentum firmly towards the underdogs and they took full advantage thanks to goals from Tomas Holes and Schick. Holes broke the deadlock on 68 minutes as Tomas Kalas got on the end of a ball into the box, heading it back across goal for Holes to nod home. It got even better for Jaroslav Šilhavy’s side on 80 minutes as Holes pinched the ball in midfield after a poor pass out from the back, darted into the penalty area, and squared perfectly for Bayer Leverkusen striker Schick. The in-form forward had a simple finish but put it away confidently to score his fourth goal of the tournament. The Dutch were frustrated but could mount little to worry the Czechs after conceding the second goal, with a third for the men in white looking much more likely than one for the team in orange. Netherlands had fashioned chances earlier in the game and will especially rue a missed opportunity for Donyell Malen when he went through on goal and tried to round Czech ‘keeper Tomas Vaclik but failed to evade the Sevilla stopper. Vaclik had an impressive game throughout, although he was not pressed into action nearly enough by a disappointing Netherlands side that had looked so impressive during the group stage. Czech Republic now set up a quarter-final clash with Denmark, guaranteeing an unlikely name in the semi-finals emerging from that contest.
