Defibrillators became the topic of conversation following the collapse of Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen at Parken Stadium in Euro 2020 game against Finland on Saturday. The incident involving Eriksen, who had suffered a cardiac arrest and needed emergency treatment, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the field, brought about the campaign for availability of defibrillators on the football pitch and public spaces.
