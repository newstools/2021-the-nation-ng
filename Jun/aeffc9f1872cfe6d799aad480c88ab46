Zamfara State Governor Matawalle will defect from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) tomorrow. His spokesman, Mr Yusuf Idris, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday that 18 APC governors would welcome him. “All is now set for our governor to move from the PDP to the APC,” he said. According to him, a grand reception will hold in Gusau, the state capital, tomorrow. “The governor will come along with all the national and state Assembly members as well as the PDP executives from all levels of the state,” Idris said. He believes the governor’s defection would strengthen the APC in the state. “Zamfara politicians have always been a single-family and even as a PDP governor, he has always related very well with those in the opposition parties. “Many people from high and low have followed the governor into the PDP in order to offer their positive advice for the growth and development of the state. “Some of such persons were given top government positions and responsibilities which they held very well too.” Idris added that Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni, who is the APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, will receive Matawalle.
