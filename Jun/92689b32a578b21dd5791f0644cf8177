Barcelona have signed Sergio Aguero on a deal until 2023, the Catalan giants announced yesterday. In a statement, Barca said that Aguero, who arrives after a decade at Manchester City, has a buy-out clause “set at 100 million euros ($122 million).” Aguero’s signing for Barca comes two days after he missed out on the Champions League with City after losing this season’s final to Chelsea. The 32-year-old leaves City as their all-time record goal scorer with 260 goals, and with the most goals scored for a single club in Premier League history – 184 goals in 275 appearances. Aguero returns to Spain after spending five years with Atletico Madrid between 2006 and 2011, and the club will hope his arrival in Catalonia helps to convince his compatriot Lionel Messi to stay.
