Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule has identified infrastructure as a major challenge confronting investors in the country. Governor Sule disclosed this yesterday in a chat with reporters, shortly after a tour of a facility owned by the Halibis Industries, a private firm owned by a citizen of Nasarawa State in Abuja. The governor, who spoke from his experience in the organised private sector, specifically identified lack of good roads, power supply, capital, among others, as factors responsible for the high cost of production in Nigeria. The governor, who expressed satisfaction with what he saw at the factory, commended the President of the Halibis Industries, Alhaji Adamu Aliyu, for his vision and the initiative, stressing that Halibis Industries can materialise into the next Nestle or Cadbury. The governor explained that he is always excited when he sees people being employed and empowered. President of Halibis Industries, Alhaji Aliyu said his company, which produces food items for distribution nationwide seeks to take the company to the next level by establishing the Afritox, an offshoot of Halibis Industries that will export products to other African countries. Alhaji Aliyu, who is indigenous to Nasarawa Local Government Area, added that the Afritox is attracting lots of partners, with Halibis Industries, soon to get approval, for the groundbreaking of the project. The Halibis Industries president sought the support of the Nasarawa State government, adding that there are lots of opportunities in the venture.
