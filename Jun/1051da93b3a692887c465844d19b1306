The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has suspended flights to and from Nigeria again. The Dubai’s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management had lifted the initial ban on Saturday. It announced resumption of flights from Nigeria several months after the ban over COVID-19 protocols. UAE official website had stated travel protocols for inbound passengers from South Africa, Nigeria and India. As at Saturday, Nigerian passengers were required to “present a negative test result for a PCR test taken 48 hours prior to departure.” UAE also said: “The negative PCR test certificate should carry a QR Code and the test must have been conducted by labs approved by the Nigerian Government. Passengers must also undergo a PCR test on arrival in Dubai.” But in a dramatic move, UAE reversed the resumption of flights to Nigeria billed to take off on June 23. Emirates Airlines, in a statement on its official website on Monday, said: “In line with government directives, passenger flights to and from Nigeria (Lagos and Abuja) are suspended with effect from 21 June 2021 until further notice. It further said passengers who have been to or connected through Nigeria in the last 14 days are not permitted to board from any other point to the UAE. While affirming its “commitment to Nigeria”, the UAE said it was looking forward to resuming passenger services “when conditions allow.”
