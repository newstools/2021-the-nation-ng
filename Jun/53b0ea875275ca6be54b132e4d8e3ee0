After months of waiting, amateur boxing returns to Lagos as The monthly Lagos “Saturday Boxing Show’’ is set to resume tomorrow at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Complex, Rowe Park, Yaba by 3 pm after more than a year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic which suspended sporting activities around the world. The boxing extravaganza, which is the premier amateur boxing programme in Nigeria is coordinated by Lagos Boxing Hall of Fame, partnering with the Lagos State Amateur Boxing Association, LABA. 2019 Africa Games silver medallist Afeez Osoba is delighted the boxing show has resumed and hopes to use the platform to gather more fights under his belt after the Nigeria Boxing team missed the Olympic trials in Senegal. Another boxer, this time the first woman to win the Lagos Governor’s Belt Ayisat Oriyomi cannot wait to enter the ring again.
