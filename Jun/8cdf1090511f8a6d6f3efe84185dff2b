Odunayo Adekuoroye showed the world what she aims to achieve at next month’s Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games after she claimed gold medal in the women’s 57kg at the Poland Open Ranking Series in Warsaw. After edging out some of the finest wrestlers in the world, Adekuoroye was awarded the gold after her Belarusian opponent Iryna KURACHKINA forfeited the final match following the injury she sustained during her semifinal fight. In the quarter final match against world and Olympic champion American Helen MAROULIS, the Nigeria champion avenged her two previous loss as chalked out a shutout 13-0 win over Maroulis. Adekuoroye was dominant that she finished the bout with a minute and 32 seconds remaining. Unfazed by her opponent’s stardom, Adekuoroye paced the bout according to herself and both wrestlers waited for an opening for the first two minutes of the bout. But there was none. The USA wrestler gave up a point for passivity as well.
