Samuel Chukwueze has undergone yet another surgery this year, his La Liga club have announced. Chukwueze, 22, was injured in a Europa League second leg semifinal at Arsenal earlier this month. The winger returned to training ahead of the Europa League final against Manchester United, but failed to prove his fitness before the game. “Villarreal footballer Samu Chukwueze has undergone surgery on his quadriceps in his left leg,” his club said in a statement. “He was operated on at the Hospital Quirónsalud in Barcelona. “The winger picked up an injury during the second leg of the UEFA Europa League semi-finals against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on 6th  May. “The Nigerian player tried everything possible to accelerate the recovery process to attempt to be available for the final of that competition, in Gdansk. A few days before the game against Manchester United, Chukwueze once more felt problems in that area and the club’s medical decided that the best option for him would be surgery. “Villarreal CF would like to wish the forward a quick and successful recovery. Get well soon, Samu!” Earlier this year, he also underwent surgery in Germany. He has now been ruled out forthcoming friendlies against Cameroon in Austria.
