For all of the unpredictability that a summer transfer window brings, one thing about this summer transfer window appears certain: Real Madrid will look to complete a deal for Kylian Mbappe. Real Madrid have held long-standing interest in the French forward, and are creating a specific strategy so that they can finally secure his signature this summer. After the club made it clear last summer that no new signings were going to be made, the sole priority this summer is to sign either Mbappe or Erling Haaland, with a clear preference for the French forward. With Mbappe unwilling to comment either in public or in private about his future until after the European Championship, Real Madrid are equally prepared to move slowly, counting on Mbappe to resist signing a new contract beyond his current deal which ends on June 30, 2022. As this happens, Real Madrid hope that Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Florentino Perez will meet to negotiate Mbappe’s departure. The European Championship Final Real Madrid know that they will have to wait until after the Euro 2020 final in order to strike a deal with PSG. Whilst the transfer fee will surpass 100 million euros, the club are looking to recuperate a significant portion of that outlay through the sale of players such as Luka Jovic, Dani Cabellos and Brahim Diaz. In 2017, Real Madrid’s move for Mbappe were complicated by the presence of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo in the team already, together with the fact that their offer was bettered by that of PSG. However, the situation now looks different. By signing for Real Madrid, Mbappe would instantly become the talisman in the Spanish capital. Both parties are looking to secure the deal, but are making sure to follow all the right steps to ensure that Mbappe will be a Real Madrid player by the end of the summer transfer window.
