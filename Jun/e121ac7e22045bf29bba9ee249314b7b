The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has said it will resume its suspended industrial action in Kaduna State. The congress directed its State councils and affiliate unions to mobilise for the latest action. President of the NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba stated this during a press conference after an emergency National Executive Council meeting of the congress on Tuesday in Abuja. Wabba accused the State Governor, Nasir El â€“ Rufai of failing to respect the Memorandum of Understanding brokered between the NLC and the state government by the Federal Government. He said the congress, after exhausting all avenues, including writing letters to President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, the Union has decided to resume the strike.
