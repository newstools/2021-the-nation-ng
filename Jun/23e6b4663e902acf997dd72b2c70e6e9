Nigeria’s Super Eagles suffered their first defeat in 2021 after losing 1-0 to Cameroon in an international friendly game that took place in Wiener Neustadt, Austria. Three –time African champions Nigeria have not lost a match since they were edged by the odd goal by reigning African champions Algeria in an international friendly also in Austria in October 2020. Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa scored the only goal of the game after launching a thunderous shot from long range which found its way into Maduka Okoye’s net. The goal came barely eight minutes before halftime and every effort from both sides especially the three-time African champions in finding a goal failed to materialise.  Super Eagles starting eleven had Belgium Pro League player of the year Paul Onuachu and English FA Cup winners Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho. That quality showed in the early stages as only individual errors presented Moses Simon, Onuachu, and Iheanacho from opening the scoring for the 2013 Afcon winners. And Cameroon made the Eagles pay for those missed chances when Zambo Anguissa arrived in the box to direct his effort past goalkeeper Maduka Okoye eight minutes before the interval. Again Iheanacho, Simon, and Onuachu were wasteful after the break, and Rohr responded by sending in Ahmed Musa in place of the Genk forward. The German tactician also handed Terem Moffi his international debut, with the Lorient target man coming on for Onuachu.
