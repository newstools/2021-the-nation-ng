Activist Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a Sunday Igboho) plans to lead a rally of those agitating for Yoruba Nation to Lagos on July 3. But the Lagos Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu said no group has approached his command in respect of a rally. The CP told our reporter: “I’m not aware of anybody planning any rally anywhere in Lagos. Nobody has written to the Command to that effect. So, when we get to the bridge, we’ll cross it.” Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had distanced Lagos from the pro-Yoruba Nation agitations, saying there is strength in diversity. The governor, in an earlier comment, called on the more than 200 million Nigerians to utilise the numerical strength and the beauty of diversity of the country to foster economic prosperity and political stability. Igboho, who spoke through Olayomi Koiki in a live video chat monitored by The Nation, said agitators will hold a peaceful rally at Freedom Park named after legal icon, the late Chief Gani Fawehinmi, at Ojota, Lagos. He said: “We are sending a peaceful message to Governor Sanwo-Olu. We do not mind any other person who is saying we should not come to Lagos. Sanwo-Olu is the chief security officer of the land and we are coming to Lagos. “July 3rd is the most important date; nobody can say we should not come to Lagos. It is a peaceful rally. We have gone to Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Ekiti and we had peaceful rallies. So, nobody can stop us from coming to Lagos.” Igboho’s supporter, Ololade Alaba Shomuyiwa, faulted those discouraging people from participating in the planned Lagos rally. Speaking further while featuring on Arise TV – The Morning Show, Sanwo-Olu had said: “We are talking about separatists. I have only one passport; there is nowhere I am going. We are here, we cannot continue to gloss over it and talk about we want to break away. Even if any breakaway will start, it will end on a table, so, let’s create that table amongst ourselves and start talking.”
