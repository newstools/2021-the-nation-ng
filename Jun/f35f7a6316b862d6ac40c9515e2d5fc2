 Veteran Argentina forward Carlos Tevez has announced that he will be leaving his boyhood club Boca Juniors. The 37-year-old said “my blood isn’t red, it’s blue and yellow”, referencing the club’s traditional colours. However, the former Manchester United and Manchester City forward did not confirm whether he was retiring. “My career in Argentina is finished,” he said. “I always said the only club I would ever play for [here] is Boca, without a doubt. Having lost his father Segundo Tevez in February after he contracted Covid-19 at the age of 58, the forward said he “didn’t even have time to mourn.” Tevez, who has also played for Corinthians, West Ham, Juventus and Shanghai Shenhua, added: “Boca asks you to give the maximum and mentally I’m not in a condition to do so. “I didn’t even have time to mourn my father and already I was playing again. “That’s what Boca demands,” he said as he broke down in tears.
