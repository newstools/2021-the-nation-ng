Many persons have been reported killed and many more wounded as suspected herdsmen attacked Odugbeho village in Agatu local government area of Benue State. Police spokesperson Kate Anene confirmed the attack in a text message. “The commissioner of police has deployed more police officers to manage the incident and forestall further breakdown of law and order. Number of victims is yet to be ascertained as officers are still engaged in stabilising the area,” she said. The attack took place on Sunday, The Nation learnt. A resident Isaac Oche, who witnessed it, said the suspected herdsmen invaded their village around 5.45pm and started shooting at anyone in sight till 6:40am, Oche said. Oche said further that about about 20 bodies have been recovered, while the search for more continued. “We cannot stay any longer to recover all the dead bodies this night because it is dark and no security, I believe more bodies will be recovered when the day breaks and security agents are around,” he said. He said the herdsmen, believed to have come from Nasarawa State, took them unawares. Oche said the attackers so many people because it was a Sunday when most people were at home. Another resident Iyu Goche said he was one of the youths who searched and recovered the bodies, adding that the death toll would rise yesterday morning. Guma, Makurdi and Agatu local government areas have been attacked in similar fashion in the past with heavy casualties, and many more forced from their homes and farmlands.
