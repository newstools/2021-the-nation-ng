Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has rewarded first Nigeria’s Olympic gold medalist, Chioma Ajunwa-Okpara with a two-bedroom flat at the Babatunde Raji Fashola Housing Estate in Iponri, Lagos. The house is in fulfillment of a 25-year pledge of the government. Ajunwa-Okpara, now an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), won gold in the long jump event at the Atlanta ‘96 Olympics in United States America (USA). Sanwo-Olu presented the keys to Ajunwa-Okpara at the Lagos House in Ikeja said she would continue to be a reference point for not just sports, but youth development. He said: “We’ll continue to use you as a testimonial to ensure our females have a voice and representation in our sports organisations. That is why we have made it compulsory that a minimum of 30 percent female representation is implemented in all of our sporting boards.” Sanwo-Olu also presented cheques, ranging from N500,000 to N5m, to athletes from the state representing Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympics in July. While those who won laurels at the 20th National Sports Festival in Edo State were also not left out of the largesse. The governor, who hinted that the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Surulere would be upgraded to international standards, urged the athletes to put in their best and do the state proud. “We are doing this so that you will have a good footing, and for the assurance that your government in Lagos State is fully appreciative of what you will do for us,” Sanwo-Olu added. Team captain and award-winning para-tennis player Ahmed Koleosho Ahmed Koleosho, who thanked Sanwo-Olu for the honour, promised that they would make Lagos and Nigeria proud.
