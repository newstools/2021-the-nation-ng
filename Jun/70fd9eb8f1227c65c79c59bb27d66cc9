Leading Nollywood actors Jide Kosoko, Dele Odule, and others have been celebrated in the recent edition of the Trophy Waa Gbayi experience campaign. The International Breweries Plc brand took time out to celebrate some of the Nollywood icons across the South West at a special event. Kosoko and Odule were joined by Taiwo Hassan aka Ogogo, Yinka Quadri, and Adebayo Salami at the experiential event which saw a retinue of poets, praise singers and drummers hail the big screen superstars with panegyrics and local songs at their places of residence. Speaking on his experience, Taiwo Hassan commended the initiative from Trophy describing it as a laudable celebration of culture. “I feel honoured that a reputable brand like Trophy deemed it fit to come all the way to celebrate me, and I am grateful to the Trophy team for this experience.” For Kosoko, the experience consolidates the obvious that the brand cares about its legends and veterans. “By this gesture, Trophy has shown that they are a brand that cares about their consumers. Because I am aware that they are not only doing this for celebrities.” Shedding light on the decision to honour the legends, Marketing Director, International Breweries Plc, Tolulope Adedeji explained that Trophy decided to pay tribute to the Yoruba movie legends to honour their enduring career and contributions to the propagation of the Yoruba culture. “Honour to whom honour is due is our tagline for this campaign, and by it, we sought to extol the virtues of people who have displayed the qualities of an Honourable. In the light of this, it wasn’t difficult to decide to celebrate those who have been integral to the success of the Nigerian film industry and have continued to entertain us with their craft many decades later,” Adedeji said.
