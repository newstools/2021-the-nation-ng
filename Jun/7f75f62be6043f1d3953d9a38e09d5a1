Twelve persons have been abducted in Zaria barely three days after a student was killed, while 10 other students and some lecturers were kidnapped in the city. The incident, The Nation gathered, happened in the early hours of yesterday. Police spokesman Mohammed Jalige confirmed the attack on the telephone, adding that some of the victims have been rescued. Asked whether the kidnappers have made any ransom demands, Jalige said most families of kidnap victims usually choose not to disclose their dealings with kidnappers. But he said efforts were on to release the remaining abductees. It was gathered that eight people were kidnapped from one house, who are mostly males. An eyewitness and a daughter of one of the abductees, Hafsat Habib Kusfa, said the bandits broke into their home around 12am and went from room to room bringing out all the occupants, and thereafter assembled them in the compound. She explained that the gunmen, who invaded their house carrying guns and machetes, spoke Fulfude and Hausa when they talked to the captives. “They took away my father, mother, sister, and my brothers, eight people in all, from our residence,” she said. Speaking further yesterday morrning, Hafsat Kusfa confirmed the release of her father and mother, whom she said were immediately hospitalised because none of them could speak.
