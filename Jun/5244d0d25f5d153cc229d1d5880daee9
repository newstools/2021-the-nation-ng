The Controller, Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS) Lagos State Command Adewale Adebisi on Thursday lamented that suspects awaiting trial for up to 12 years are still at the Kirikiri Maximum Security Correctional Centre in Lagos. He said they are among the 6,800 inmates awaiting trial in the five correctional facilities in the state at Ikoyi, Kirikiri (Female), Kirikiri (Medium), Kirikiri (Maximum) and Badagry. Adebisi spoke at Kirikiri during a plea bargain sensitisation session by the Lagos State Ministry of Justice as part of efforts to decongest correctional facilities. The Kirikiri Centre has a capacity for 1,076 inmates but currently houses 1,830 inmates, 283 of whom have been convicted; 1,075 are awaiting trial and 88 are serving life terms; 372 are on death row while 12 inmates are lodgers (inmates in transit). The government team including heads of agencies and directorates, among others, was led by Lagos State Attorney-General (A-G), Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN). Adebisi said: “In Lagos, we have 8,000 incarcerated inmates in the correctional facilities, out of which a total of 6,800 inmates are awaiting trial. “Obviously the largest percentage is awaiting inmates, some of whom have been on trial for between 10 and 12 years.” Adebisi described the plea bargain sensitisation session as “the first of its kind in Nigeria”, adding that it would, among others, help to decongest the custodial centres and reduce the crime rate. Responding, Onigbanjo explained that 27 inmates comprising 16 males and 11 females benefitted from the plea bargaining session, adding that it would be a continuous exercise. He said 530 persons have benefitted from plea bargaining in Lagos State since 2017.
