The race for the Euro 2020 Golden Boot is heating up as we enter the business end of the tournament, with the knockout stages set to begin on Saturday. The trophy is awarded to the player who scores the most goals at Euro 2020. If multiple players have the same number of goals, then it will come down to whoever has the most assists. If the players are still level, then whoever has played the lowest number of minutes will win. Cristiano Ronaldo The Portugal captain currently leads the way with five goals and has stolen the limelight once more at the tournament. A late double against Hungary in Portugal’s opening match was followed by a goal against Germany and two more against France in the final group-stage game. Cristiano Ronaldo is by far and away the favourite to win the accolade, especially given his country are expected to go far in the tournament. Romelu Lukaku The Belgium forward opened his Euro 2020 account with two goals against Russia in what was an impressive performance by both himself and his side. After failing to score against Denmark in the following game, Lukaku responded with a late goal against Finland to move him onto three strikes for the tournament. His Belgium side play Portugal next, meaning that either he or Ronaldo will exit the tournament at the last-16 stage. Ciro Immobile The Italy forward has scored in both of the matches he has played in so far before being rested in the final group-stage game against Wales. With Italy being potential dark horses to win Euro 2020, Immobile will have chances to improve on his goal tally in the latter stages of the competition. Italy face Austria next and you wouldn’t bet against Immobile scoring again.
