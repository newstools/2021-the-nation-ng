Plateau State Governor and Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Barr. Simon Bako Lalong has hailed the Speaker and Honourable members of the Plateau State House of Assembly for their doggedness in carrying out their legislative functions, which have strengthened democracy in the State in the last two years. Governor Lalong, in a statement by his spokesman, Dr. Makut Simon Macham, described the 9th Plateau House of Assembly under the leadership of Speaker Abok Nuhu Ayuba as very proactive and collaborative in the governance of the state. He commended them for passing critical laws that have direct bearing on the people and also carrying out robust oversight on the Executive, which has strengthened accountability and transparency in governance. While urging them to redouble their efforts in carrying out their duties and responding to the needs of their constituents, the governor assured them of the support and collaboration of the Executive towards improving the living standards of the citizens and providing security and peace. On autonomy, the governor assured them that the Executive has been very positive towards implementation, which explains why even before the recent agitation, many aspects of autonomy have been implemented with just a few aspects to be tidied up once modalities are worked out.
