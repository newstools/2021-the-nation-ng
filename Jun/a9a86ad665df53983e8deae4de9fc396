Tonto Dikeh and D’banj have hosted a worship session together to mark their new age. The worship session was held in the actress’s house. It was attended by their family and friends and hosted by music minister, Moses Bliss. In a 35-minute video shared on Tonto’s Instagram page, the mother of one was seen with her co-celebrant, D’Banj in deep worship as they extolled their maker, reverencing God over their lives. The duo with few friends and family members were seen in intense mood of worship as they appreciated God for the gift of life, growth and opportunity to mark a new age. While Tonto worshipped in tears and lied face flat on the floor, D’banj went down on his knees. The two later joined their hands together as the others prayed with them, declaring God’s blessings over their lives as they celebrate a new year.
