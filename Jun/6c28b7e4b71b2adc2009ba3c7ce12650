RANGERS will have to pay €4million (£3.4million) if they want to sign Fenerbahce’s Bright Osayi-Samuel, according to a report in Turkey. Aspor claim the Light Blues will hold talks with the Turkish club later this week having initially offered around €3million. The 23-year-old ex-QPR forward was linked to Rangers in January as his contract in North London came to an end but he opted to sign a pre-contract with Fener. Turkish journalist Yagiz Sabuncuoglu claimed last week that Rangers had made an offer for Osayi-Samuel but was scant on detail. With only one goal and one assist in 19 appearances in Turkey, his move to Fenerbahce hasn’t really gone to plan for the Nigerian star. With the Gers making their return to the Champions League this season, a move to Ibrox would surely appeal to the former QPR man. One potential stumbling block could be the fee though with Rangers unlikely to want to spend too much on someone who won’t necessarily be a regular starter at Ibrox. There would be plenty of competition in the wide areas with the likes of Ryan Kent, Scott Wright, Kemar Roofe, Ianis Hagi, Cedric Itten and Joe Aribo all being deployed there at times last season – as well as the prospect of a second chance for Glenn Middleton. Throw in fringe players like Jake Hastie and Jordan Jones and the imminent arrival of Fashion Sakala, the Rangers hierarchy are likely to want to move some bodies on first before adding another new face.
