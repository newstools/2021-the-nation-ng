Manchester United have not offered Paul Pogba a new contract, the France international told a news conference. “I have one year left on my contract, everybody knows it. I know that the club is … well there has not been yet a concrete offer,” Pogba said. “It has not been done. We finished the season with the Europa League then we went on holidays. So, I didn’t sit down with Ed Woodward and the manager. We haven’t spoken and of course, I am still at Manchester United.” Pogba, 28, moved from Juventus to Old Trafford for €100 million in the summer of 2016, having left the Premier League giants on a free for Juve four years earlier. At the moment, however, he is still waiting for an offer, but said he will focus fully on the upcoming Euros with Les Bleus. “My only thoughts for the future now are on the Euros,” he said. “I really want to focus on my tournament. I don’t want people to say, ‘Oh he is not focused because he is thinking about his club, about his future, about his situation.’ Regarding my club, when there is a competition like this, I avoid [thinking about it].”
