Former Chairman, Police Service Commission (PSC), Chief Simon Okeke has described as worrisome the growing insecurity in the country, particularly in the Southeast. He regretted the series of attacks on police facilities, which he linked to accumulated aggression on the part of the citizens, but noted that such anger was misplaced. In a chat with reporters in his Amichi country home in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State, Okeke said although there were bad eggs among the police, that was not justifiable reasons for the series of attacks on them. He said: “Southeast has been among the safest in the states across the country, especially Anambra. But quite sometime now, that peace and serenity have been disturbed and uprooted. If there is any peace, it’s that of the graveyard. “But nothing happens without a cause. The EndSARS broke down the peace we have. “It’s uncertain what people are now reacting to. Nobody is good, and even if the Police are bad, is that why they will be killed and their buildings and stations burnt?
