France forward Ousmane Dembele has reportedly been ruled out for the rest of Euro 2020 after limping off during his national side’s draw against Hungary. The Barcelona attacker was a second-half substitute on Saturday but he had to be replaced by Thomas Lemar just 30 minutes after coming onto the pitch as he suffered a knee injury. France boss Didier Deschamps said that Dembele tried to continue after taking the knock but the injury-prone 24-year-old was forced to come off after he attempted to play a cross into the box moments later. The Daily Mail reports that the knee injury will see Dembele miss the rest of France’s tournament this summer and he was released from the national squad on Monday. Since joining Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund for over £100m in 2017, Dembele has struggled with injuries and will now have to return to the Spanish giants to start his recovery. France currently top Group F and face Portugal tomorrow in their final group game.
