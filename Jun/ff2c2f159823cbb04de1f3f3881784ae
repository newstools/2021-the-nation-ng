Actor Olanrewaju James Omiyinka aka Baba Ijesa was yesterday granted bail by an Ikeja sexual offences court. Justice Toyin Taiwo also released him to his counsel Babatunde Ogala (SAN) pending the perfection of his bail conditions, which he must fulfil in seven days or be returned to remand. Baba Ijesa’s bail  was in the sum of N2 million, with two sureties each in like sum. The judge also barred him from making any  pronouncements on the matter. “This case has become subjudice. Nobody must say anything or make any comment about this case again, particularly all actors and actresses. The order of Justice Taiwo followed complaints by counsel Ogala that there was much misinformation about the matter on the social media and that the image of the defendant had been battered. At commencement of trial, Ogala announced the appearance of 19 defence counsels, including himself and Dada Awosika , a senior advocate. The court directed him to reduce the defence team to six.
