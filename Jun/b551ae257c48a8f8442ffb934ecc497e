The Enugu State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, has ordered the ban on roadblocks within the state. The CP also directed area commanders, divisional police officers and commanders of tactical/operational units of the command to ensure strict compliance and enforcement of the Inspector-General of Police, Baba Alkali Usman’s order, suspending the issuance of SPY number plates and permission for tinted car glasses. In a release issued by the spokesman of the police, Daniel Ndukwe, Aliyu said he had directed the arrest of motorists who cover their number plates. While urging the commanders to ensure the order was professionally enforced to the letter, the police boss also cautioned motorists to desist from driving unregistered vehicles, covering or using unauthorised government number plates as well as replacing their number plates with vehicles’ logos. He further cautioned motorists against the illegal use of siren and unpermitted tinted glasses prior to the suspension. According to him, anyone found wanting would be arrested and prosecuted. He further enjoined residents to remain law-abiding, vigilant and promptly report suspected criminals and their activities to the police.
