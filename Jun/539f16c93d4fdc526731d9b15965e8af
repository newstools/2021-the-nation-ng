The Ilorin Emirate Descendants Progressive Union (IEDPU), through its President Alhaji Aliyu Otta Uthman, has  urged new Professors of Kwara State University (KWASU), Malete, to be relentless in contributing to knowledge and  justify their new status by providing solutions to contemporary challenges. He enjoined them to ensure they used their new positions to mentor younger colleagues, adding that  it was important for their impact to be felt. In a statement, Uthman, who congratulated the scholars, said the union was pleased with the promotion of Drs. Binta Sulyman, Sanni Mubarak, AbdulSami Imam Arikewuyo and Ibrahim Laaro Abubakar. The statement said  the elevation of Dr Sulyman  would certainly encourage more women working at the institution and elsewhere to pursue excellence in their chosen careers notwithstanding other competing responsibilities. The president praised KWASU  Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Muhammad Mustapha Akanbi (SAN), for rewarding intellectual productivity and professional excellence through the promotion of those distinguished scholars. Uthman said the development only served as confirmation that  the Ilorin Emirate community was  gradually advancing in  teaching at the highest level of the nation’s educational system.
