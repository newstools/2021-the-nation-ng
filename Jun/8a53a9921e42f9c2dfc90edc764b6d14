The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has urged a Federal High Court in Abuja to reject the application filed by former Abia State Governor, now senator representing Abia North, Orji Uzor Kalu. The former governor is asking the court to stop his planned retrial for alleged N7.1 billion fraud. Kalu was charged and tried with his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited, and an ex-Finance Director in the state, Ude Jones Udeogu, for their alleged complicity in diverting N7.1 billion from the state’s coffers. They were convicted and, while Kalu and Udeogu were imprisoned, Slok was wound up. But, upon an appeal by Udeogu, the Supreme Court set aside their trial and conviction in a judgment on May 8, 2020, on the grounds that the trial judge, having been elevated, ought not to have continued to hear the case. In the judgment given in an appeal filed by Udeogu, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in the case. Kalu is now seeking to prevent the retrial with his application in which he argued, among others, that a retrial would subject him to double jeopardy. At the mention of the case yesterday, lawyers to all parties, including Oluwaleke Atolagbe (for the prosecution), told the court that necessary processes had been filed and exchanged. Justice Inyang Ekwo adjourned till July 2 for adoption, after which a date would be set for the court’s decision.
