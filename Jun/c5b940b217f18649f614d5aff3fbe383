The trial of a kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike alias Evans was yesterday stalled at an Ikeja High Court due to the absence of a defence witness Evans’ counsel Oyekunle Falabi told the trial judge, Justice Hakeem Oshodi that the female witness whose name was not given could no longer be reached via phone. He subsequently requested the court for an adjournment to further look for the witness. “My lord, I have been trying to reach her on phone but her line is switched off. I am praying that the court should give us a short date,” he said. Counsels to Evans’ five co-defendants also agreed with Falabi’s request for an adjournment. Justice Oshodi adjourned the case until June 29. The case has stalls for years for similar reasons as given yesterday.
