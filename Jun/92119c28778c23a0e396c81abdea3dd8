Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh on Wednesday, June 9th celebrated her 36th birthday. While she received goodwill messages from fans and colleagues, her former bestie and crossdresser, Bobrisky was unusually quiet about the occasion. He neither sent a gift nor celebrated with the birthday girl. They usually flaunted their love for each other and were always seen together at social events. At some points, Bobrisky vowed never to leave his best friend, until death did them part. In the past, Bobrisky would have taken to his social media accounts to pen lovely messages to Tontolet however it appears to be different this time around. The Nation had reported that Bobrisky blocked his one-time ‘best friends forever, Tonto Dikeh, on Instagram after she unfollowed him.
The duo, which stopped hanging out and making comments on their social media pages, has not been on talking terms since then. Although, Bobrisky had noted that he is very discrete about his relationships while reacting to their rift. He said; “Friendship break up too so its normal… But don’t spoil them around to people or talk about your relationship online. What I share btw my friend should remain btw us. Amebos looking for gossip… una go wait. I DON’T KISS AND TELL.”
