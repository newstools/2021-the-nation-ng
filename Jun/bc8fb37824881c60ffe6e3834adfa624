Record executive and audio engineer, Don Jazzy has caused excitement among his fans when he revealed he wants a baby. The Mavin Records boss shared a video where a baby had to crawl to meet a parent, either the mom or dad. It appeared the couple was having a challenge to see whom the child will crawl to first. The couple switched positions twice but the baby always crawled to meet the mom, making her the winner of the challenge. This made the ace music executive to state he wants a baby so that he can have the same challenge with the mother of his child and win her. Don Jazzy posted the video and said: “Now I want a baby just so I can do this and win the mother.” Fans of the 38-year-old have reacted to his desire. Some ladies offered to bear him a child so he can fulfill his desire. Some others have barely commented about the video, stating babies know who feed them and would always go for that persona at that tender stage. A few have stated Don Jazzy may just be informing people that he is expecting a child quite in an indirect manner. aakwa_ugo wrote: “I’m ready.” Pheonaelyanu said: “Can I be your baby mama? @donjazzy, I’m really fertile.” chinnyelsie stated: ““Baby has gone to who will give him breast.
