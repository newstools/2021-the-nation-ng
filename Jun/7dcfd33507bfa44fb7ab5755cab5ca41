The Secretary to Anambra Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu says that government is unyielding on the ban on use of motorcycles, tricycles and shuttle buses for commercial transportation across Anambra. Chukwulobelu said this in a press statement made available to newsmen on Tuesday in Awka. He said that the ban is between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. for one month in the first instance. According to him, the temporary ban is aimed at improving the security situation in state and to curtail criminal activities often perpetrated using motorcycles and tricycles. The SSG restated that the earlier ban on the use of commercial motorcycles in greater Onitsha and Awka areas during the day and night remained in force. Chukwulobelu warned that any commercial motorcycle found within these areas would be impounded, forfeited and urged the operators to comply with the directives. He also said that shuttle buses were banned from using tinted glasses or curtains while plying Anambra roads. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that government had ordered all other vehicles either with factory fitted tinted glasses or plain glasses to always wind down while approaching any security checkpoint to avoid embarrassment. The government had also charged community leaders to take responsibility for the supervision and compliance to the directives. It also directed youths and stakeholders in communities to take ownership of security in their environments to complement law enforcement agents in order restore law and order in the state. (NAN)
