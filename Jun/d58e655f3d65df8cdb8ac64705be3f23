The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has directed candidates affected by the de-listing of 24 Computer Based Test (CBT) centres to reprint their examination notification slips for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry Examination. The board, who disclosed this in a statement by its Head of Media, Dr Fabian Benjamin on Monday in Abuja, said the new directive applies to centres de-listed. The statement reads: “Candidates who were scheduled to take examination in delisted cantres can proceed to print their examination notification slips from Sunday, 20th, 2021 for their new schedule date and time. “This applies only to centres delisted. “You will recall that 24 centres were delisted for performing below the tolerable limit of the Board while over 40 others were put on the watch list.” JAMB, on Saturday de-listed 24 centres saying their performance fell below the tolerable limit of the board during the conduct of the ongoing 2021 UTME.
