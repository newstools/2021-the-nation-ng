A farmer, who was kidnapped at Elegure farmstead in Iyemero Ekiti in Ikole Local government area of Ekiti State, on Friday, Alhaji Jimoh Olodan, has regained his freedom. Olodan was abducted at a farm near Iyemero, after bandits numbering 18, had stormed the community in a desperate search for a successful farmer. The bandits later called on Saturday and demanded for a N30 million ransom from the family. A community source who confided in our reporter disclosed that Olodan was freed by his abductors after paying the sum of N2m. He was said to have been found inside the forest in Kwara state around 5.30am on Monday by a search party after the negotiated ransom was dropped at a designated location for the abductors to pick. He added that the farmer was released due to concerted efforts undertaken by local hunters, vigilante Group of Nigeria, Oodua Peoples Congress and Amotekun Corps by combing of the forest between Ekiti-Kogi-Kwara borders. “The family had on Sunday paid a sum of N2 million out of the ransom requested for with a mission to continue with negotiation after getting the first tranch of the money. “But the search team in Iyemero Ekiti who went on combing the entire forest to the borders of Ekiti with Kogi and Kwara states went deep into the forest and pursued them to the night time. “Upon realising that the search party was closing in on them, they abandoned the man and ran away. “We thank God that the man was released unhurt and he was in good and sound health,” he said.
