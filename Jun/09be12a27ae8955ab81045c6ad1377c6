The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has directed candidates affected by the de-listing of 24 Computer-Based Test (CBT) centres to reprint their examination notification slips for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) examinations. The board, which announced this in a statement yesterday in Abuja by its Head of Media, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, said the new directive applies to the centres that were de-listed. The statement reads: “Candidates who were scheduled to take examination in delisted cantres can proceed to print their examination notification slips from Sunday, June 20, 2021 for their new schedule date and time. “This applies only to centres delisted. “You will recall that 24 centres were delisted for performing below the tolerable limit of the board while over 40 others were put on the watch list.” JAMB, on Saturday, de-listed 24 centres. The board said their performance fell below the tolerable limit during the conduct of the ongoing 2021 UTME
