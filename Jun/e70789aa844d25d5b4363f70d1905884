President Muhammadu Buhari has written the House of Representatives to seek approval of N894.842bn supplementary budget to fund purchase of COVID-19 drugs and weapons for the Armed Forces. In a letter addressed to Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila read at Tuesday plenary, the President said the supplementary budget is limited to some critical needs, stressing other needs will be contained in the 2022 budget. The President indicated the 2022 Appropriation Bill will be presented to the National Assembly in September. The President said COVID-19 drugs will be procured from the supplementary budget as the Federal Government intends to vaccinate about 70 percent eligible Nigerians before the end of 2022.
