Some fleeing bandits chased by troops of 4Demo Battalion of the Nigerian Army have killed two persons in Igabi council. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Sameul Aruwan, who made this known in a statement, said an unidentified passenger was also killed along Kaduna-Zaria road. Aruwan, in the statement, said troops of the 4Demo Battalion, Nigerian Army, reported to Kaduna Government that bandits were repelled in some locations along the Kaduna-Zaria highway, in Igabi local government area. He said the bandits were reportedly sighted moving towards the highway from Sharu village in the Kerawa area. The troops, acting on credible intelligence on the bandits’ movement, laid an ambush and intercepted them at Lambar Zango and Hawan Kwaranza villages. At these locations, the bandits were engaged in a fierce firefight and suffered several casualties. “The bandits, having been decisively halted by the troops on these fronts, retreated hastily via another route and in the process attacked Dunki village, where they killed two residents: Abubakar Sani and Abubakar Saleh. “An unidentified male traveler was also killed,” he added. He said the retreating bandits also raided Mashashiya and Farguza villages from where they stole some livestock and other valuables.
