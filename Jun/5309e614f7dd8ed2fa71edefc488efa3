A Magistrates’ Court in Birnin Kebbi on Tuesday ordered that a man, Onyebuchi Okafor and Mansura Shehu, be remanded in a correctional centre in Birnin Kebbi for alleged adultery. The police charged Okafor and Shehu with adultery which led to a pregnancy. The offence contravenes the provisions of Section 369 of the Penal Code. The presiding Judge, Samaila Kakale-Mungadi, in a ruling rejected the oral bail application for Okafor from his counsel. Kakale-Mungadi ordered the defence counsel to make a written bail application. He ordered that the two defendants be remanded until July 5, for further hearing. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Mr Jibril Abba, told the court that Okafor should not be granted bail until all investigation in the matter is completed. Abba opposed to the bail because he said that Okafor was an ex-convict. The defence counsel, Magnus Ihejirika, told the court that his client will not jump bail or obstruct the investigation if granted bail. He also argued that his client had no criminal record. Ihejirika, who refuted the claims of the prosecutor that the first accused person, Okafor, was an ex-convict, told the court that a High court had set aside the conviction of his client and acquitted him. “We urge my Lord to discountenance the objection and admit him into the bail. “He will not float the bail conditions. He will provide sureties and be attending court proceedings,” the counsel prayed. (NAN).
