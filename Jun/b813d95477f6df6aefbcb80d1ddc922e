Nigeria’s Postmaster General, Dr. Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, has said postal services hold a lot of potential for the growth of Africa. Adewusi spoke at the weekend after his election as the Second Vice Chairperson of the Pan-African Postal Union’s (PAPU’s) 10th Session at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. The Postmaster General was elected at the end of the 10th Ordinary Session of PAPU Plenipotentiary conference. While Zimbabwe, the host of the conference for this year, was elected Chairperson, Algeria was elected fisrt Chairperson to run the affairs of the continental body for the next four years. Founded in 1980, PAPU is a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) overseeing postal services on the African continent. A statement yesterday in Abuja by NIPOST’s General Manager of Corporate Services, Franklin Alao, said the postmaster general of ZimPost, Mr. Sifundu Chief Moyo, was elected PAPU Secretary General. It was the first time a Southern African country was elected to the position in PAPU’s 41 years of existence. Adewusi said postal agencies across Africa must tap into the new opportunities offered by technology to help the economies of their respective countries. “The incursion of technology into communication has changed the way things are done. But rather than relegate postal services to the background, those who run postal organisations across this continent must continuously look inward to ensure that we leverage technology to contribute to the economies of our countries,” Adewusi said.
