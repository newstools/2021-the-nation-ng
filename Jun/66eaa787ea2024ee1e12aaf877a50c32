THE Super Eagles striker is on his off-season break, but unlike his international teammates, he has been using the time to train back in Lagos There are no off-days for Victor Osimhen after the Napoli striker was seen training with a group of non-league footballers in Lagos. With the season over, Osimhen should be on holidays recharging his batteries. However, unlike his Super Eagles teammates, who are currently enjoying their holidays, Osimhen is in Lagos training with some local footballers. The 22-year-old was seen yesterday playing on a local pitch in Nigeriaâ€™s commercial capital while also giving out advice to these players. Osimhen will hope to carry his form in the last few weeks of the just-concluded campaign into the next Serie A season. The Nigerian international joined Napoli from Lille for a club and African record fee last summer, but he failed to settle in quickly.
