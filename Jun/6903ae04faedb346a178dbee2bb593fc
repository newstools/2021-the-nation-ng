One of the highlights of the 12th episode of the BBNaija Reunion show was the showdown between ex-housemate, Vee and disqualified ex-housemate, Erica. The showdown between Laycon’s bestie, Vee, and Laycon’s ex-crush, Erica, had both ladies expressing sheer disgust and disdain for themselves. Responding to Ebuka after Erica’s outburst, Vee said she doesn’t associate with Erica because she’s not her friend. “I don’t associate with Erica and we don’t talk,” she stated. Continuing, Vee said, “ Contrary to what Erica said, we had several conversations while in the house about Laycon and Kiddwaya and TolaniBaj can testify to it. I look out for my friend and I don’t look out for people I don’t care about.” TolaniBaj, who had expressed her disdain for Vee in the third episode went to corroborate Vee’s submission that she had conversations with Vee about Laycon but ended it saying she doesn’t care about Vee because they aren’t friends just as Vee doesn’t look out for Erica. After all, they aren’t friends
