Budding Afro-Pop singer, Jerry Orhemba Lawale aka Jerrygolld has said his latest single entitled, ‘Love Up’ is aimed at addressing insecurity in the country. Jerrygolld recently released the audio and visual of the song featuring Xman. Speaking on the motive behind the track, the artist who started music professionally in 2019 opened up that the newest tune is a call to put the guns down. “Love Up’ is a song so dear to my heart because it addresses the ills going on in the country. Why are we so unkind to mankind? So much bloodshed, killings, kidnappings, raping etc, going on – it’s a call to put the guns down. If the government has failed us, we shouldn’t fail ourselves.” Jerrygolld, who is currently working on his Extended Play, promised to channel his energy by churning out conscious songs to impact lives. “I see music as a tool and platform to reach out to people. I do conscious sounds that when people listen to – they’ll definitely pick something to keep you going. Not smoke, alcohol inspired me. I draw inspiration when am all quiet, my personal experiences and listening to great sounds inspire me as well.” On his motivation, the entertainer who is a graduate of Mass Communication from Benue State University, said: “I see a lot of people around me going through stuff. Poverty, lack, pain. This keeps me pushing because I want to put smiles on people’s faces. For me, that’s truly the essence of life and this where I draw my inspiration to write my lyrics. Life has taught me not to be unkind to mankind. Life is a process, do your best, grow at your pace and allow God and time to sort the rest because everyone has his/her time and you can make meaning out of life irrespective of your background or situations.”
