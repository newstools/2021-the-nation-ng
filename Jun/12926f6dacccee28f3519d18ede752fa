Ex-BBNaija season 5 housemate, KiddWaya has denied ever flaunting his family’s wealth on the fourth episode of the ongoing Reunion Show. The ongoing Lockdown Reunion Show has seen several insane moments from the ex-housemates. During the reunion show on Thursday, June 23, Kaisha confronted Kiddwaya in relation to some sensitive utterances he made during their stay in the House that made it look like he was advertising his family’s wealthy status. Kaisha said: “You said that your father helped some politicians to get to certain positions. You also said that you flew into Lagos on a private jet to come for the show. “All that, does it not mean that you are trying to tell people that you are wealthy? “You are trying to say that you did not show your wealth but I am telling you the things you said that made it look like you were showing off your wealth.” Responding to Kaisha, Kidd stated clearly that he never flaunted nor voiced anything about his family’s wealth but may have attempted to show them off as powerful. He went further to state that living his normal life gets misinterpreted by people as flaunting wealth. The billionaire son said; “Let us get something clear, I never spoke about my family’s wealth. I spoke about the fact that my father helped some politicians to a certain position, but that is not wealth. That is a power move, not wealth. Me living my normal life, to you, means that I am showing off wealth.”
