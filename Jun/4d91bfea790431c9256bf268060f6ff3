Head-Teacher of Tegina Islamiyya children’s school where a large number of pupils were recently abducted has said the abductors have started beating the children in captivity. Many of them can no longer walk, it was gathered. Headteacher of Salihu Tanko Islamic School Abubakar Alhassan said in a phone in interview on Arise TV monitored by The Nation three of his teachers comprising two females and one male were abducted alongside the children. One of the female teachers “said that they have started beating them, no food or water and that some of the children’s legs are swollen and they can no longer walk.” Alhassan said one of the parents of the abducted children died on Tuesday, adding that her only child was among the kidnapped. The headteacher lamented that state government has not visited the parents. “The situation we are in is very sad. We have received no delegation to sympathise with us. Even regarding the ransom, we have received no response from them.” The community has started raising funds for the N110 ransom N110 million. The Nation learnt that town criers have been going round the community asking residents to donate towards the rescue of the abducted children.
