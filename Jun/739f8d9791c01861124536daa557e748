Two lawmakers from Borno State have supported moves by the House of Representatives to investigate the N500 million safe school initiative fund voted for rebuilding the Government Girls’ Secondary School (GGSS) Chibok, Borno State. Senator Ali Ndume of Borno South District and Representative Ahmed Jaha of Chibok/Damboa/Gwoza Federal Constituency, gave the support yesterday in Chibok while speaking to reporters on the completion of the GGSS Chibok project embarked upon by the Borno State Government. They said the probe became necessary to find out what happened to the N500 million meant for the project under the Save School Initiative in 2015. Senator Ndume said there are questions to be answered on what happened to the funding from the Federal Government that warranted the Borno State government to intervene to complete the project. “While we commended Governor Babagana Zulum for his courage in rebuilding the school, we need to know what happened to the money allocated for the project because what was on the ground before the Borno State government took over is nothing to write home about. “I learnt that a committee has been set up by House of Representatives to investigate what happened to the money under the Safe School Initiative and I am in support of the move,” Ndume said.
