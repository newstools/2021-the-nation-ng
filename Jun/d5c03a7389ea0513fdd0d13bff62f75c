Nigerian equities reopened yesterday with a streak of profit-taking as investors sought to monetise their capital gains. With investors opening up market orders to close their deals, the market closed with average decline of 1.66 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N340 billion.

Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also dropped from its opening value of N20.409 trillion to close at N20.069 trillion. With 26 decliners to 19 advancers, the negative overall market situation was driven by widespread selloffs due to profit-taking, especially in lager and mid-cap stocks such as Airtel Africa, Okomu Oil Palm, Presco, Stanbic IBTC Holdings and Guaranty Trust Bank.
