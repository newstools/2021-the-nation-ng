Former Governors Rochas Okorocha and Emeka Ihedioha were conspicuously absent at the summit organised by Special Bishops Committee on Peace in Imo State. Two-term Senator for Imo North, Ifeanyi Araraume, was also absent at the peace talk held on Tuesday at the Maria Assumpta Cathedral, Owerri. Archbishop of Owerri Archdiocese, Archbishop Anthony Obinna, however said that he was not disturbed about the absence of the leaders. Obinna, who is chairman of the peace committee, however explained the process is ongoing and noted there was still chance for the absentees to attend. He called for prayers for the talk to come up with positive inputs that will help Imo return as the most peaceful state in Nigeria. “We have noticed that some quiet is returning in the state. We are not taking seeming apparent quiet as a final position that is why all hands have to be on deck to contribute in bringing peace back to Imo State,” he stressed. Sub-committee chairmen of the event, Prof. Maurice Iwu and Jerry Chukwueke, expressed satisfaction at the level of attendance by the stakeholders while hoping that more will turn subsequently. The summit, according to Chukwueke, is for the clerics to interface with the past leaders and see how to swiftly return to business and restore confidence in investors after the insecurity challenge in the State. Others that attended the summit were former Governors Ikedi Ohakim and Achike Udenwa; Senator Frank Ibezim (Imo North) and Senator Chris Anyanwu, who represented Imo East.
