The World Health Organisation (WHO) has engaged over 6,000 health providers and community mobilisers to execute a four-month immunisation programme against malaria in Adamawa State. The immunisation programme, expected to be launched by the Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri in the coming week, is designed to curtail malaria as the rainy season gets underway and the mosquito population increases in Adamawa State. WHO indicated at a media sensitisation workshop in Yola, the state capital, that it was set for the Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) programme for which it will deploy 3,300 health care providers, 2,700 social mobilisers and 211 monitors to immunise 958,000 children against malaria across the 21 local government areas of Adamawa State. Children thus reached are protected from the harm that malaria parasite bearing mosquitoes could inflict. The WHO’s National Consultant for Malaria in Emergencies in Northeast, Dr IniAbasi Ngass, said the targeted children are between three and 59 months. Children under five years are targeted because they are severely affected by malaria. “The capacity of more than 3,300 healthcare providers and volunteers, 2,700 social mobilisers and 211 monitors have been built for this implementation. The Global Fund, through the National Malaria Elimination Programme, procured and delivered over 3.2 million doses of SMC drugs for four circles of the campaign,” she said. She added that the exercise would be conducted from house to house and that the SMC drugs would be administered on the targeted children over a five-day cycle every month for the next four months.
