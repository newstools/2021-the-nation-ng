Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has warned the newly sworn-in chairmen of the 23 local government areas of the state against borrowing money without first notifying the state government. The governor gave the warning shortly after the chairmen took their oaths of office at the Banquet Hall, Government House, Port Harcourt on Thursday. Wike said the caution was necessary to stem the unguarded desire of some council chairman to access money without any developmental plan. He said: “Don’t go and borrow money without the state government’s approval. Some of you tried it last time and started with your blackmail, saying help us, we are finished. “You have no authority to go and borrow money.  Even we as State government, before we go and borrow money we get approval from the Debt Management Office. No bank will even give us. “Before you borrow money, the state must know what you want to use it for, and how you will pay it back.” The governor revealed that he prevented the immediate past  chairmen from paying local government workers’ salaries following security reports and complaints by some councillors and political appointees that they would not be paid their entitlements. The governor particularly urged them to establish a robust working relationship with the Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) and the traditional rulers for a regular security meetings and briefings.
