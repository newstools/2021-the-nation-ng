Davido’s late 2020 jam ‘Jowo’ has surpassed 30 million mark view on the popular streaming site, YouTube. ‘Jowo’ is the 3rd single off Davido’s 2020 album ‘A better time’. The song was a huge banger, which created a heated race on social media especially with the guest appearance of former BBNaija season 5, Nengi as a video vixen. The DMW boss is the only Nigerian artist who has the most-watched music videos on YouTube, with ‘Fall’ claiming the top spot at more than 200 million views.
