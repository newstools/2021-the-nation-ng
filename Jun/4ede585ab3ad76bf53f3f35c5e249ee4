A herdsman has reportedly killed a 26-year-old in Egbede community in Ogba-Egbema-Ndoni local council of Rivers State. Residents lamented herders invasion of their farmlands, alleging that their son, Nonye Nwa-Omoku, was killed by one of the herdsmen on  Thursday without any provocation. A source said: “We saw the Fulani man coming towards us. Next thing, he shot in my direction. “He shot my brother two times. We didn’t do anything to him”. A relative of the deceased, Confidence Wellington, said: “Fulani herdsmen have been threatening our people. If you go into the bush where my people, elders, our mothers are farming, these herdsmen will threaten them and chase them out. Now they have killed my younger brother. So, we are begging the state government to help us, chase away these herdsmen from our community and protect us”. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni confirmed the incident, saying the matter was under investigation.
