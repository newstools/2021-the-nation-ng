Bimbo Odukoya Foundation (BOF), a non-governmental organisation, has advocated  quality education for children across the country and continent at large. Its Executive Director, Mrs. Aderonke Oyelakin, who is also the Lagos State Coordinator of Child Protection Network, said providing qualitative education for every child in the country and Africa was paramount to growth and development. In an event to commemorate the Day of the African Child last week in Lagos, Oyelakin noted that educating  children should not be compromised as it remains the best way to lift them out of poverty. The Lagos State Coordinator of CPN said many children do not have access to basic education  because of  parents’ inability to afford tuition fees, among others. “It is important to raise awareness on the need to improve the quality of life and access to free education of children living across Africa. There are several reasons children go uneducated which include economic hardship,  early marriage which usually, keep girls from the classroom and others, but with continuous efforts and proper support, all these are surmountable. Children are active members of society who need  the support of everyone to achieve their potentials,” she said. Oyelakin urged pupils to know their rights and stand for same during a visit to schools across the state. The BOF,  as part of activities to commemorate the Day of the African Child, reached out to pupils to enlighten them on their rights and how to safeguard them. The schools visited  include: Kosofe Senior Secondary School Ketu, Zumratul Islamiyah Junior/Senior Secondary School Yaba, Oduduwa Senior/Junior Secondary School, Ladipo Oshodi; Ilupeju Primary School, Ilupeju; Ransome Kuti Junior Secondary School Yaba and Community Primary School, Ilupeju.
