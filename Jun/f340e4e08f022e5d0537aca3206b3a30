P.Priime, the 18-year-old producer behind DJ Cuppy’s hit song, ‘Gelato’ featuring Zlatan says he’s eager to showcase his writing and singing abilities. The talented producer, who was born Aderogba Oredope, says he doesn’t want to be limited to being a music producer despite amassing enviable production credit that dwarfs his age. “I don’t want to be limited to being a beatmaker. I do a lot more than that; I write, sing, direct live music, and many other things. Besides, being a beatmaker is me bringing the dreams of an artist to live and I’d like for them to do the same to me,” he noted in a recent chat. Continuing, he said, “Age means nothing to me. If anything, I feel privileged and I feel like the universe has put me on a pedestal and as a result of that, I’m the voice for the next generation. I’m well-brought-up and very disciplined which makes it quite easy for me. I am very much in touch with older people whom I have around me. Their rich counsel help to keep me in check,” P.Priime, whose credits include “Like I Do” by Fireboy, “Gelato” by DJ Cuppy, “Egungun” by Zlatan, and seven songs in Olamide’s latest album, Carpe Diem, revealed that he plans to release an EP.
