 A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mike Ahamba (SAN), has said the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, will not portend danger to the unity of the country. Ahamba, however, advised the Federal Government to manage the situation well. To Kanu, he said: “He needs to get good lawyers to defend him.”. The SAN added: “It ( arrest) does not portend any danger to the country. It will not increase the tense situation. If he is guilty he will be declared guilty and if he is not he will be declared not guilty.“ A group, the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), alleged that the arrest of Kanu was “an evil plot to silence Ndigbo forever.”  COSEYL, in a statement by its President-General, Goodluck Ibem,  also described as dehumanising, the treatment meted out to the IPOB leader by Interpol and Nigerian security forces. It wondered why Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai; President of Miyetti Allah Bodejo and herdmen had not been arrested for threats to lives. The group said: “Mallam  El-Rufai had prior to the 2019 general elections threatened to kill international observers. “The President of Miyetti Allah severally ordered his members to kill other Nigerians from other tribes and herdsmen on their part kill, rape and maim indigenes of Southern Nigeria. None of them has been arrested or prosecuted by security agencies.”
