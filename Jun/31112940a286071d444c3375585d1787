Ex-BBNaija housemates, Lucy and Kaisha could not hold themselves back on the sixth episode of the Reunion show. Both Lockdown housemates clashed on last night’s episode of the reunion. The clash resulted in an attack which made Lucy slap Kaisha on live TV. This year’s Big Brother Naija Reunion has brought a lot of controversies and drama. Housemates have attacked and disrespected themselves on the show. This episode, which was aired on Thursday, June 24 came with even more intensity and a physical fight between two female housemates; Lucy and Kaisha who have been bitter rivals since the original run of the show in 2020. They finally allowed their feud to reach a climax as they ended up in a fistfight. The fight began after Kaisha narrated how Ka3na reportedly disrespected her mother as they partied together. According to Kaisha, her mother liked Ka3na and wanted a photo with her. She revealed that her mother first sent Lucy before sending her sister Zainab to ask Ka3na for the photo; but she reportedly asked them to tell her mother to come to her table, the feedback she found disrespectful. Ka3na however maintained that she thought they were talking about Kaisha’s manager. Lucy who backed Ka3na on this, however, failed to explain why she didn’t deliver the message when she was asked to. As the show continued, Kaisha made a demand for them all to stop talking about her mother. Lucy fired back by asking if her mother is a fruit; insisting she was talking about fruit. This angered Kaisha who then threw a pillow at Lucy, leading Lucy to swiftly strike her across her face which eventually led to a physical fight. Lucy was seen later being escorted without her wig on. She was also talking about Kaisha being violent and further threatened to beat her up.
