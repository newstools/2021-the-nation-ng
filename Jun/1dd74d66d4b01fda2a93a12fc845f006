An Ogba Chief Magistrate’s Court in Lagos has fixed July 6 for the trial of businessman Paul Eigbefor charged by the police with alleged attempted kidnap and N12.7million fraud. Eigbefor’s trial was scheduled for last April, but could not go on following the commencement of an indefinite strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) on April 6. The strike was called off on June 6. Eigbefor, of 7, Ladoke Akintola Street, GRA-Ikeja, Lagos, was arraigned last January by the Inspector-General of Police Response Team (IRT), before Chief Magistrate A. Odusanya. In two charges – MIK/F/7/2021 and MIK/F/6/2021 – the police accused him of conspiracy, kidnapping, attempted murder and N12,738,000 fraud. He was alleged to have committed the offences around Opebi Link Road, Ikeja, between November 19, 2019, and August 1 and 7, 2020, alongside his company, SmarshInvest Integrated Services Ltd. In charge MIK/F/6/2021, the businessman was alleged to have conspired with his company to fraudulently obtain N10 million from one Oluyomi Olumide, under the pretext of investing the sum in his company’s product named ‘Smarsh Integrated Services Ltd’, in return for multiple returns. He was also alleged to have procured one Olalekan John to kidnap Olumide when he demanded a refund of his investment. In the charge marked MIK/F/7/2021, Eigbefor and his firm were accused of defrauding one Victoria Ajenipa of N2,738,000 on the same pretext used with Olumide. The offences, according to the police, contravened sections 611, 405, 411 and 314 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015. Eigbefor pleaded not guilty and was admitted to bail in the sum of N2million with two sureties on each charge.
