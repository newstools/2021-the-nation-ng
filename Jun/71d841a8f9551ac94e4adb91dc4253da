Music executive and entrepreneur Ubi Franklin born Ubi Ekapong Ofem has revealed he makes more money every time he is trolled on social media. The founder of the record label Made Men Music Group (Triple MG) made this disclosure during a chat with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu on “Rubbin Minds”. The 35-year-old talent manager revealed he has ventured into several businesses so that his kids can live the best life event though some of them do not reside in Nigeria. The media owner also revealed lately he has been working on himself to fully equip himself to handle all the drama that comes with having several baby mamas around him. “These days, if they tell me they “baby mamas” need this I don’t argue with them. Before I used to argue and ask them what they needed all those things for,” he said. While giving an example of the time his son swallowed a coin during a visit to his house, the father of four said the situation made him understand the efforts his baby mamas put in raising his kids. Ebuka asked Franklin how he handles cyberbullies who use his kids’ and baby mamas’ situations to troll him. He replied: “For every time they hit me on social media, I make money. Before when they hit me on social media I’d go into the room and cry then I noticed that whenever this happens, somebody that knows somebody that knows me is either buying a property from my company or booking an apartment” among other things said. Franklin, who is the current Special Adviser to Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade on Tourism, further stated that as long as he is doing his duties as a father he is not bothered about the bullies on social media.
