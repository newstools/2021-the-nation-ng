The Bayelsa State Police Command has warned members of the public in the state to steer clear of any form of association with the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (lPOB). The Commissioner of Police, Bayelsa State Command, Mr. Mike Okoli, gave the warning in a statement on Thursday. Okoli said intelligence available to the command indicated that some misguided elements were planning to set up IPOB cells in the state. He, however, said that police operatives in the state were on their trail and monitoring their activities. The Commissioner said the command would deal decisively with any person or group of persons that attempt to disrupt the prevailing peaceful security situation in the state. “The Bayelsa State Police Command hereby appeals to the good people of Bayelsa State to go about their lawful and legitimate business as the security agencies are on the ground to ensure that peace and order is maintained in the state,” Okoli added.
