Paulo Fonseca has agreed to become the new manager of Tottenham Hotspur, according to the Telegraph. Spurs have conducted a thorough, and at times frustrating, search for a successor to Jose Mourinhoâ€™s old job, with the likes of Brendan Rodgers, Hans Dieter Flick and Julian Nagelsmann turning the north Londoners down. The Premier League side appeared close to coming to an agreement with former Inter boss Antonio Conte only for chairman Daniel Levy to abandon his pursuit as talks stalled. Spurs have since turned their attention to former Roma boss Fonseca, the number one candidate of new sporting director Fabio Paratici, who has held talks with the 48-year-old this week. And The Telegraph reports that Fonseca has agreed in principle to a two-year deal to take the Tottenham vacancy, with the option of an additional year.
