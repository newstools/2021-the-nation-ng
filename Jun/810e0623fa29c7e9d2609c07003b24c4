Since President Muhammadu Buhari issued Executive Order 10 last May, governors of the country have been all over the place, murmuring about implementation and modalities. The executive order, which stirred the hornets’ nest, granted financial autonomy to the legislative and judicial arms of government. This is a trite principle of democracy and democratic consolidation. It should have been a non-negotiable, static constitutional provision from independence which would have played its part in consolidating the country’s sickly democracy. Not only is it democratic, it is also native good judgement that when a body is created to perform oversight functions on another body, then the overseeing body must, of a necessity, not be dependent on the body it oversees for subsistence. But, governors have been restive since the order was given. First they went in their numbers to make clarifications on what exactly was going on. After dallying for the better part of a year since the order, they would say last month that the presidency was ill advised on the national order. The All Progressives Congress governors, in a move that seemed more political than democratic, agreed this week to implement the order. It should never have taken them so long to come to that conclusion. If the devil is not in the detail, then it does not matter much; no point looking a gift horse in the mouth, is there? In Nigeria, the right thing has now become a gift.
