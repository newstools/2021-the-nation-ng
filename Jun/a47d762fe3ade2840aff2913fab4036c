The member of the House of Representatives representing Ikeja Federal Constituency and Chairman of the House Committee on Finance, James Abiodun Faleke, has restated his commitment to the actualisation of the presidential ambition of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Faleke made this clarification and commitment yesterday while disowning a video posted on the social media abusing and denouncing the APC National Leader. He said: “I’m one of the most active proponents and promoters of the Tinubu 2023 Presidency and I remain loyal and committed to that struggle. I’ve said this publicly several times and I’m saying it once again.” Faleke, the two-time chairman of Ojodu Local Council Development Area, said he was not the sponsor of the protesters captured in the video, adding that as a loyal party man, he had no reason to question the decision of the party on any issue. “I did not sponsor the protesters and I’ll never do so. I am a loyal and committed party man and I have never questioned the decision of the party and I won’t start now,” the prime mover of Tinubu Support Group (TSG), arguably the strongest pro-Tinubu for President group, said. He said his political rivals, some of whom he had defeated several times in elections, produced the video to discredit him.
