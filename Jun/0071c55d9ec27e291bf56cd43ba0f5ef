Reality TV star and former Big Brother Naija housemate, Tacha Akide has rubbished claims the show helped her life. Tacha, in a short viral TikTok video posted on her Twitter page, on Thursday said the reality show only gave her a platform. Tacha explained that in return for the platform, she gave Big Brother a ‘show’. The controversial social media personality went ahead to brag about being the highlight of the “Pepper Dem” season noting the show would have been bald without her presence. Speaking in a mocking manner while she laughed hysterically, she said: “Helped whose life? What? Oh my gosh!! Una dey crack me up for this app o, legit! Big Brother gave me a platform, Tacha gave Big brother a freaky show. What’s pepper dem season without Tacha like? Get your facts right. “And listen, it is not compulsory to put a comment on every post, some post, just jump and pass if you do not have anything to say, nobody will beat you, okay? Stop exhibiting your foolishness on TikTok.” Tacha has disqualified from BBNaija 2019 edition for violating the rules of the show.
