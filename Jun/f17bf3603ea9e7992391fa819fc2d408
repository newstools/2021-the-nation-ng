The Lumosa family, representatives of the Estate of Iyalode Efuronye Tinubu, has elected five members to represent it on the Board of Trustees it shares with another branch, the Sobowale family. The Lumosa Family had recalled its former representatives for allegedly transferring its power of attorney held by Adamakin Investment and Works Limited and its director Chief Akinfolabi Akindele to Lagoon Park Global Resources without authorisation. At a meeting in Oke Ido, Abeokuta, Ogun State on June 10, 78 members of the Lumosa family elected Sufian Kazeem, Sauban Lawal, Olalekan Kassim, Birikisu Kazeem and Waheed Kazeem as the new BoT members. They replaced Adio Kassim and Safiu Kassim. The meeting resolved to add a technical committee comprising five members, namely Nojeem Abiola, Musiliu Lawal, Mutiu Kassim, Muritala Kazeem and Saheed Kazeem. Monsuru Lawal Lumosa was appointed as the General Secretary of the Lumosa Family. All but four members of the family voted in favour of the new appointments, with the decision to have five BoT members, a deviation from the previous practice of two per family. The family had accused the former BOT members of “not representing the family as expected of them” and warned the public against dealing with them.
