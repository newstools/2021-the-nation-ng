The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will, next week, publish the locations of new polling units it created recently. This will come ahead the commencement of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), the commission has said. INEC had begun the expansion of existing polling units across the country to boost voter access and reduce apathy during elections. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, announced this yesterday when the Federal Fire Service (FFS) presented a fire engine to the commission in Abuja. The INEC chairman said the commission accomplished the task for the first time in 25 years. He said: “We earlier assured Nigerians that we shall conclude work on the expansion of voter access to polling units and make the new polling units available to citizens ahead of the CVR exercise. “I am glad to report that we have accomplished this task for the first time in 25 years. A comprehensive list of the new polling units will be published next week. Similarly, details of the locations of the registration centres and the procedure for the commencement of online registration will also be made available after a series of regular consultative meetings with stakeholders next week.” On the donation of the fire engine, the INEC chairman hailed the FFS, saying 18 incidents out of the 42 attacks on the commission’s facilities, resulted from arson.
