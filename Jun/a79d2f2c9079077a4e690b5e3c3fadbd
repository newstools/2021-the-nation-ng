The Lagos State government says it has dislodged 10 more illegal slaughter slabs and animal markets in four areas of the state. The areas are Ayobo in Ipaja; Mangoro in Old Lagos Abeokuta Expressway; Maya and Odogunyan in Ikorodu. The state Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, who announced this yesterday in Lagos, said that the exercise was in continuation of the state government’s sanitisation and reform of the red meat value chain. Olusanya said the goal was to produce wholesome meat for the consumption of the citizens. She said the exercise was carried out by officials of the Monitoring, Enforcement and Compliance Team of the Ministry of Agriculture. The commissioner noted that during the exercise, 34 animals and 4.5 tonnes of meat carcass were confiscated. Olusanya said the confiscated live animals would be auctioned at the Mobile Court of the Lagos State Task Force on Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences Office with all offenders duly prosecuted. She stressed that there would be no option of fine to serve as deterrent to others. “During the week, officials of the MEC team of the state, dislodged four illegal slaughter slabs and animal markets at Ayobo-Ipaja, Odogunyan and Maya in Ikorodu, as well as Mangoro, on Old Abeokuta Expressway. “During the operation, 21 live rams, 13 live goats and well over 4.5 tonnes of meat carcass were confiscated. “The meat carcass, after being certified safe for consumption, had been donated to orphanages and correctional homes. “It has been observed that animals slaughtered at these illegal slaughter slabs are not inspected by veterinary officials, as a result, the wholesomeness cannot be vouched for.
