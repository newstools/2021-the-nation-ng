A suspected robber was on Wednesday evening set ablaze by an angry mob along Jakpa Road, Uvwie council area of Delta state. It was gathered the incident occurred close to Church of God Mission, Praise Centre along the ever-busy route. Residents claim the suspect was a member of a gang of four, including a woman, who operates with a tricycle. According to a source, who spoke in confidence, the armed hoodlums had stormed the Small Market Street, robbing unsuspecting shop owners and households of valuables. “After robbing that street, they moved to the street beside Praise Centre to continue their day-light robbery. But boys and vigilante members in the area summoned courage and chased them. That was how one was caught and instantly dealt with,” the source said. Another resident disclosed that the suspect was shot dead before he was set on fire. The acting police spokesman for the Delta State Police Command, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident to The Nation.
