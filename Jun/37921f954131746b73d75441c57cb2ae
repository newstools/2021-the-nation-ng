 Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has said Nigeria will overcome its current challenges and come out stronger. He urged Nigerians to unite and defend the nation’s democracy from those he said seek to create instability and chaos. Lalong spoke at an inter-denominational church service to mark this year’s Democracy Day at the Government House Chapel, Rayfield, Jos, the state capital. The governor admitted that the democratic journey, particularly since the return to civilian rule 22 years ago, has not been easy, but hoped the nation will overcome its current challenges. He said: “This special day reminds us that it is an occasion we should cherish and also use to rebuild our confidence and patriotism in Nigeria. “The task of building the nation is a collective one which all of us must partake in. There is no doubt that Nigeria is facing many challenges today, ranging from insecurity, unemployment, poverty and unity. “These are not problems that began yesterday but an accumulation of our journey to nationhood. We should never give up on our nation or make negative confessions about its destiny.”
