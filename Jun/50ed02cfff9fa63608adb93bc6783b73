Suspected cultists have killed a 33-year-old man identified as Emeka in Obosi Street, Ogui New Layout, Enugu metropolis in Enugu State. The Nation gathered that Emeka, who resided in Chief Agbo Street within the layout, was traced from his street to Obosi Street, where he was killed. The victim, who operated a laundry outfit in his house at Chief Agbo, was said to have gone to meet with a friend in Obosi Street when he was shot and killed Wednesday night. A neighbour, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent, said the killing has created panic in the area. The neighbour, who preferred anonymity, said: “Some yet-to-be-identified gunmen attacked and killed a young man by name Emeka along Obosi Street in Ogui New Layout. It is believed to be a cult rivalry. “Once there is an attack and fatality, people naturally expect a reprisal, a counter-attack. So, everybody in Chief Agbo Street and even Asata environs is scared, being very careful. It is not just being exposed to attack by the cultist, but also from being harassed by security operatives. So, everyone is tensed.” Attempts to get the spokesman of the state police command, Daniel Ndukwe to comment on the incident proved abortive as his phone rang out without response while a text message sent to his phone was not responded to.
