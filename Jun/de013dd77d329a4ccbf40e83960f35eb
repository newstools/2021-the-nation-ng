The Enugu State government has commenced the repairs of the damaged Abakpa Bridge threatened by erosion, from possible collapse. The government’s response followed the outcry of the residents of the area, who drew government’s attention to the imminent collapse of the bridge. Our correspondent gathered that the bridge became a nightmare to road users with the rains and heavier traffic occasioned by the closure of the T-Junction as erosion gradually crept in. It was equally revealed that an integrity survey had been conducted on the bridge by the state Ministry of Works and result being evaluated. The Commissioner for Information Chidi Aroh who visited the site yesterday said the government had already mobilised contractors to the site to commence work immediately on the bridge. He said: “All our people are fully mobilised. It’s just part of the government’s commitment that wherever there is an emergency we respond. “This is an emergency created by the rains. We have experienced plenty of rain in recent time. The accident is a result of the rain but in the state government’s commitment, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi ordered all our people, including the contractor who we have given this job to do to move to the site, even though it was on a Sunday. “It is not about talks, it’s about doing. Every action is being taken to ensure that this place is properly done. “The governor has been assured by the Ministry of Works and Infrastructure that in the shortest possible time, given all the engineering requirements, we are going to restore this place in a very normal situation and our people will move about without any hindrances. “But in the interim, we plead with our people to exercise caution in the use of this road now.”
