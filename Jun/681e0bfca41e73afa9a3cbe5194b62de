Olamide Baddo’s latest song “Rock” has made it to the no. 9 spots on Billboard’s top triller global chart, making him the only African artiste on the top 10.

The latest one for the week ending on Saturday, June 5, 2021, shows Olamide’s “Rock” jump 8 spots from 17th position last week to 9th position this week. “Rock” has attained that position by virtue of being one of the most used songs on the triller app since its release.
