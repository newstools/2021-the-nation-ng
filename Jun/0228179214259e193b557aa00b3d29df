One of the kingmakers for the selection of a new Oba for Akunnu community in Akoko North-East Local Government, Mr. Olorunda Agoyi popularly known as Ewureni has slumped and died. His death, however, stalled the selection process of a new Oba. The Oba of Akunnu died in 2019 but a new Oba could not be picked because there were only two surviving kingmakers in the community instead of eight. Late Agoyi was among the six kingmakers also known as Warrant Chiefs that were picked from six quarters in the community for the purpose of selecting a new Oba. Explaining how Agoyi died, an elder of the community, Babatunde Oluwaseun, dismissed reports that Agoyi was contesting to be an Oba and that he died during the consultation of Ifa Oracle. Oluwaseun stated that Agoyi might have been killed through diabolical means because he refused to do the bidding of some persons in the community. He said Agoyi slumped at a meeting and all efforts to revive him failed. According to him, “Mr. Agoyi was not a contestant to the obaship stool of Oluwade of Akunu. He was a retired staff of Ondo State SUBEB. “He was a selected Warrant Chief in a selection process which was organized, supervised, and recorded by local government council officials and witnessed by government security agents. “There was no form of divination at the venue of the meeting on the said day. “It is unfortunate that the life of the selected kingmaker who was known to be a cool-headed man, humble, and respectful retiree was cut short in such a pitiable manner. “It is our resolve that the seven ‘kingmakers’ should continue the process of selecting a new king for Akunnu since seven kingmakers out of eight kingmakers have formed a quorum.”
