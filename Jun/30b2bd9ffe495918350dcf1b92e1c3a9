The world-renowned logistics industry magazine “Port Strategy” of London, UK, has reported that ICTCI’s investment in Onne Port will engender competition in the sector. The global port operator ICTSI made a major investment to expand Nigeria’s modern port capacity in the face of loud protests and attempts of legal obstacles by a local operator. The Port Strategy article gives interesting insight into how the international logistics industry sees the entrance of ICTSI into Nigeria and the protests of a local operator. In broad terms, Port Strategy sees ICTSI’s entry into Eastern Nigeria’s Onne Port as very necessary introduction of competition and investments into a port too long dominated by vested interests protecting their monopolies. And it sees a local operator’s reaction as a monopolist trying to maintain its market and pricing power in the face of new competition. Port Strategy starts by pointing out that Onne Port – is the only major modern port in Eastern Nigeria for Oil and Gas cargo and West Africa Container Terminal (WACT) for containerised imports. Port Strategy concludes with the following assessment: “ICTSI has clearly arrived in Onne Port when there is a manifest need for new competition. According to port users, it is a welcome change and one that represents progress in the nationwide drive to deliver competitive port and logistics services.”
