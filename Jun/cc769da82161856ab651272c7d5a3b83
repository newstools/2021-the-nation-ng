A farmer kidnapped at a farm in Iyemero Ekiti, Ekiti State, on Friday, Alhaji Jimoh Olodan, has been freed. Olodan’s abductors, on Saturday, demanded N30 million but a community source told the reporter that N2m was eventually paid to free the prominent farmer. He was said to have been found inside in a Kwara State forest yesterday by a search party after the ransom was paid. The source said the farmer was released due to concerted efforts by local hunters, vigilantes, Oodua People’s Congress and Amotekun men. Police spokesman Sunday Abutu said his men led the search team that rescued the farmer from bandits. “I told you on Saturday that the police immediately swung into action upon hearing that the farmer was kidnapped. So, we led the search team that chased the bandits into the forest to ensure that the victim was freed,” he said.
