Police in Ogun have arrested a housewife, Blessing Ebuneku Agoro, for allegedly selling her two daughters for N300,000 to a childless couple. The suspect was arrested following a report at Redeemed Camp divisional headquarters by her husband, Oluwaseyi Agoro, that upon his return from  a trip on June 8 he could not find his two daughters. He said all efforts to get his wife to tell him the girls’ whereabouts were abortive. Police spokesperson Abimbola Oyeyemi said in a statement yesterday that the divisional police officer Alabi Akinjide detailed his detectives to apprehend the suspect. “On interrogation, the suspect explained to the police that her husband left home for the past two years, and while he was away, she found it difficult to cater for the two children with her other two children she had for another man. “She stated further that while she was contemplating what to do, one Kolawole Imoleayo introduced her to a couple in Port Harcourt who are in dire need of children, and she sold the two daughters to the couple at the rate of N300,000. “Her confession led to the arrest of the said intermediary, Kolawole Imoleayo. They are both assisting the police in their investigation,” Abimbola  stated. Police said the children must be rescued and brought back to their parents as soon as possible.
