No fewer than 30 persons were feared killed and many injured on Sunday when suspected herdsmen attacked Odugbeho village in Agatu local government area of Benue State. Benue Police spokesperson Kate Aneene, a DSP, confirmed the incident but was silent on the casualty figures. She said: “Agatu attack is confirmed and the Commissioner of Police has deployed more police officers to manage the incident and forestall further breakdown of law and order. “Number of victims is yet to be ascertained as officers are still engaged in stabilising the area”. A witness, who is an indigene of the village, Isaac Oche, said: “The suspected herdsmen invaded the village around 5:45pm and started shot sporadically. They killed anyone in sight and operated freely till 6:40 am. Oche stated about 20 bodies have been recovered while the search for more corpses continues. He said the herdsmen were believed to have come from Nasarawa State, passed through the neighbouring local government of Gwer West in guerrilla style for the attack. He said the casualty figures were high because most people were at home, being a Sunday. Our correspondent gathered the village is completely deserted because of absence of security agents.
