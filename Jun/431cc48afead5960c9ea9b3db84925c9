A human rights and pro-democracy group, Foundation for Environmental Rights, Advocacy and Development (FENRAD) has expressed worry over violent unrest and civil disturbances among members of the host community and military formation stationed in the Ohafia Council Area of Abia State. The group, in a statement by its Executive Director, Comrade Nelson Nnanna Nwafor and Head Legal Team, Olusegun Bamgbose also expressed concern over the alleged silence of Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu on the crisis. The continued silence on the part of the state government is inopportune and far from ideal at a time like this. “It is the primary duty and mandate of the government to protect lives and properties of citizens and aliens as enshrined in the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) just as it is also the obligation of the state government anywhere to ensure that citizens’ rights, here being rights to life and property, are guaranteed.
