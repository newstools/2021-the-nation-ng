Stanbic IBTC Bank, a member of Standard Bank Group, has upgraded its USSD platform with innovative features. The platform tagged, “Bigger and better” will enable customers to make seamless transactions. Some of the new features on the platform include the bill payment gateway for billers such as the DISCO companies, which will enable customers pay their electricity bills without stress; auto-airtime top-up, which allows customers to set up a mandate for airtime top-up whenever their balance drops below a set benchmark; as well as direct data top-up. Executive Director, Personal and Business Banking, Stanbic IBTC Bank, said, Remy Osuagwu: “We are dedicated to meeting the banking needs of our customers. Improving customers’ experiences at every touchpoint with the brand is critical. “We are optimistic that the new features added to our USSD platform will indeed give our customers a bigger and better banking experience.” To onboard, customers were told to dial *909*11*1# to register and enter the last four digits of their debit cards to create an authentication PIN that will be used to approve transactions anytime and anywhere. Existing users can access the new platform by dialling *909#. Osuagwu assured the bank’s customers of the organisation’s commitment to develop digital banking solutions to meet their needs.
