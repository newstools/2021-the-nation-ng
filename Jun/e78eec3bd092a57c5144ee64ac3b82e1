Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom on Monday held a meeting with two of his predecessors, Senators George Akume and Gabriel Suswam. Akume, the current Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, is a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and governor from May 29, 1999 to May 29, 2007. Suswam, the senator currently representing Benue North East, a chieftain of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was governor from May 29, 2007 to May 29, 2015. There have been killings across the state, especially from attacks by herdsmen on farmers and Internally Displaces Persons (IDPs). Addressing reporters after the meeting, Ortom said he and his predecessors were concerned about the security and economic challenges confronting the state. The governor stressed that the meeting was convened to brainstorm on the appropriate actions to restore peace and development in the state. He noted that irrespective of their political affiliations, he and his predecessors are sons of Benue State and must work together to ensure the development of the state. Senators Akume and Suswam corroborated the governorâ€™s statement, saying the peace and development of Benue State was above any personal interest.
