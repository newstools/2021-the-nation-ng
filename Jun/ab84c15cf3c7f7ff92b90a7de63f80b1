The draw for the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon will no longer be staged on June 25 on the request of the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Local organisers said the postponement was due to logistical reasons related to the Coronavirus Pandemic. A new date for the draw will be announced soon. The 2021 AFCON will be played between January 6 and February 9 in Cameroon. The competition will welcome 24 teams drawn into four teams of six groups. Algeria are the defending AFCON champions after they pipped Senegal 1-0 in the final of the 2019 edition in Egypt.
