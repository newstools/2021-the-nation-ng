The Lagos State government yesterday handed over the indoor hall of the popular Mobolaji Johnson Sports Complex, Rowe Park in Yaba, to the contractor for the commencement of work on upgrading the facility to international standard. The official handing-over ceremony was performed by the Chairman of the Lagos State Sports Trust Fund, Femi Pedro alongside some board members and Executive Secretary, Olaposi Agunbiade with the first rehabilitation expected to be concluded by December 2021. Pedro, a former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, described the edifice as one of the legacies of the state in terms of sport as many top athletes in Nigeria had used it to rise to the top of their careers. The contractor, Bytrax Technologies Limited will execute the rehabilitation under the supervision of the Lagos State Ministry of Works and Infrastructure. “I think this is one of our major work as a board and this is also in line with the agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu which is youth empowerment through sports. We believe upgrading this facility to international standards would attract more international competitions to the state while our athletes would also use it to train themselves in readiness for major competitions. This rehabilitation work has commenced officially from today (yesterday) and this is the first phase of the work while the second phase will take off at the expiration of the first phase,” Pedro said.
