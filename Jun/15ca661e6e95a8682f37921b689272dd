The Emir of Zazzau, Ambassador Ahmad Nuhu Bamali has decried the security challenges occasioned by banditry and kidnapping in his domain, particularly Zaria, saying that bandits have laid unbridled siege to Zaria. The Emir, who described the security situation as unacceptable and a situation no one prays for added that residents of Zaria now feel vulnerable and are in a state of fear. Recall that a student was killed and 10 others, including eight students and two lecturers, were kidnapped when bandits attacked Kaduna State-owned Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic in Zaria last Thursday. Twelve other people were kidnapped by gunmen in an attack on a new residential area of Kofar Gayan/Kofar Kona axis of Zaria in the early hours of Sunday. Emir Bamalli, who spoke when heads of security agencies in the state led by the state’s Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan visited his palace yesterday, lamented that children can no longer go to school as bandits are moving about unchecked. He, however, called for urgent security action. “We call on security personnel and agencies to rise up to the challenge and put an end to this sad situation.  The security heads, however, said the aim of the visit was to douse tension and build the confidence of residents of Zaria. They said they also came to commiserate with the Emirate over the recent spate of attacks and kidnappings of residents in the area. The Commissioner of Internal Security assured the Emir that there is a heavy presence of security in the 12 local government areas that make up the Zazzau Emirate. Aruwan, however, noted that it is not possible for security personnel to be at every nook and cranny of the communities, hence the need for community leaders to collaborate with the security agencies.
