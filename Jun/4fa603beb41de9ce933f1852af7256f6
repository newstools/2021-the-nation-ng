Imo Governor Hope Uzodinma has accused opposition politicians and other disgruntled personalities of passively encouraging insecurity across the country. Uzodinma spoke to State House Correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja Uzodimma also said he alone cannot guarantee security in the crisis-ridden state. He said other stakeholders, including traditional rulers, religious leaders and politicians must engage more with the people to restore peace in the state. According to him, former political office holders who fail to speak out against the activities of trouble makers have questions to answer. He said if they had been speaking out in condemnation of the unwholesome activities of those destabilising the country, things would have been different. While he noted he was in the Villa to brief the President on the situation in the state, he admitted that all is not well with the country. He however noted that those who are destroying government property must be ready to face the consequences. Details shortlyâ€¦
