Gospel Artiste Evang Mrs. Toluwalase Adelegan has reacted to the trending controversy surrounding the popular Christian song Oniduro Mi. Adelegan, in a video obtained by The Nation, explained she is the original composer of the song, which was part of an album she released about seven years ago. The Nation observed the song, which is currently trending, has been sung by Tolu Adelegan, Shola Allyson and Yinka Alaseyori, at different times. In a video making the rounds on social media, Tope Alabi criticised the song, saying God isn’t her guarantor because He’s more than a guarantor. Tope Alabi’s comment drew the ire of many Nigerians especially on social media platforms. But Adelegan in the song listened to by our correspondent explained how God stood for her as a guarantor during tribulations and trials. She said: “I want to appreciate you all for what happened yesterday and for now that it is still trending.. I assure you, I won’t disappoint you. “The video of that Oniduro mi will be out soonest. “I thought before that I want to remix it but now I won’t remix it. I will do it the way I have done it. “I have sold over 25,000 copies on that Album within that seven years to the glory of God but I want to do the video and I assure that on or before July ending, the video will be out. “I promise you all that the video will be out, don’t let us rush it.” She added Adelegan urged worshippers to let Jesus be their guarantor and not seek powers of the world.
