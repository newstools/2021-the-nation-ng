The Forum further reiterated its commitment to diligently represent their constituents. He said: “As the people who are here to represent our people, we have the duty to do more to find plausible solutions to these challenges. “I know we are using the security outfits very well, but there are also other ways we will discuss to see how best we can find solutions to the problem.”
