They are expected to respond to audit queries contained in the comments of the Auditor General of the Federation on the group financial statement of the Nigeria Port Authority for 2016. They are equally expected to give a breakdown of the Ports and Quays Services income stating the respective income from each of the services, scheduled oil terminal dues, details of pilotage and service boats and the nature of rentals services offered and rates applied. In addition, the Auditor General said they are to answer questions from the lawmakers, giving breakdown of maintenance, budgetary provisions and evidence of work done on the channels and waterways as “examination of the accounts revealed that the channels and waterways maintenance rose from N44.427 billion in 2015 to N64.130 billion in 2016, an increase of over N20 billion. The comments suggest that the NPA incurred about N38.412 billion as service charge on the Ports and Quays and demanded that the management of the Authority provide details of how these charges were incurred and also to explain what they meant by the term “others” for which about N4.7 billion was spent. The Auditor General said that further examination of the accounts of the NPA revealed that Intels Integrated Services Limited were over paid their commission to the tune of N2.099 billion. The Minister and the NPA management are also to explain what happened to the dividend income of N643.006 million received from their joint venture partners as well as interest income of about N97.8 million and N28.7 million being interest from bank deposits and interest on loan and receivables.

The Auditor General’s query signed by Adolphus Aghughu and dated 24th May, 2021also identified what it called understatement of depreciation charges to the tune of N6.4 billion stressing that “the provision made against eight classes of property amounted to N4.472 billion as against N10.891 million arrived at during vetting. “If however, the under provision of depreciation was attributable to assets which have been fully written down, the nominal values at which such assets were retained in the books should be disclosed.”
