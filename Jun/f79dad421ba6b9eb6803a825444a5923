Jubril Adewale Tinubu’s sojourn into entrepreneurship, building a multi-billion dollars business conglomerate, is worthy of a biopic. At a relatively young age of 27, he had doggedly settled with a steely resolve to rule his world later in life. Call it an audacious ambition you are still spot on. Therefore, having conquered his greatest fears, while on the threshold of leaving the family law firm that had begun to give him fame, he, together with trusted and tested friends, set up Ocean and Oil, Oando, which has now grown to be a conglomerate. Interestingly, he will surely reminisce on this slice of his inspiring journey in life tomorrow June 26, 2021, when he will turn 54. We gathered that family, friends, and business associates, who all know his humble beginnings, could not agree less with him when he announced that he would rather mark the day glorifying God for all he has done for him instead of throwing an elaborate party. In the past years, another side of his life that has enjoyed interesting discourses is his philanthropy. In today’s Nigeria, when you think of a philanthropist, his name will pop up so deservedly. In 2019, he, alongside some prominent Nigerians, visited the IDP camp in Maiduguri, Borno State to attend to the needs of some of the casualties of terrorism. Recently, he also donated books to 15 universities and two national libraries across Nigeria. Speaking on the initiative, he said it was aimed at educating students and the public on the country’s an oil & gas sector, a sector that remains the largest contributor to the country’s forex earnings. In addition to giving back to society, Tinubu, also a devout Muslim, recently donated hundreds of millions of Naira towards the building of a mosque in Abuja. For this and more, friends, close associates as well as well-wishers will surely have nice words to say about him tomorrow as he marks his birthday.
