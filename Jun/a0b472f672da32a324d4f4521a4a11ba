Tokyo Olympics-bound Elizabeth Anyanacho will lead three other taekwondists to the 2021 African Taekwondo Championships to be held between June 5 and 6 at Dakar Arena in Senegal. The 21-year-old is expected to use the tournament as part of her build-up to the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. Already, Anyanacho continued her preparation for the African championship being her first outing in the continental showpiece while Nwosu is also training with the Olympics-bound athlete in the Abuja Olympic camp under the supervision of the Technical Director of the Nigeria Taekwondo Federation, Chika Chukwumerije. Meanwhile, Cote d’Ivoire’s four taekwondo qualifiers for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics have been boosted by $81,300 (N36.5m) grant by the country’s government. The “preparation bonus” will  reportedly help Cheick Sallah Cissé, Ruth Gbagbi, Seydou Gbané and Aminata Traoré as they prepare for this year’s re-arranged Games in the Japanese capital.
