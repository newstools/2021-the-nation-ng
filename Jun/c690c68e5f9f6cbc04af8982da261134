The Senior Staff Association of Universities, Teaching Hospitals, Research Institutes and Associated Institutions (SSAUTHRIAI) has urged the Federal Government to allocate more fund to research to fast track development of the country. Its General Secretary Dr. Ezekiel Popoola made the appeal in Enugu where the National Executive Council (NEC) led by the President of SSAUTHRIAI, Dr. Benjamin Akintola, held its sectoral council meeting of research institutes at the Projects Development Institute (PRODA), Enugu. According to Popoola, research remained key to Nigeria‘s development and that one of the ways to encourage research is through adequate funding. He said: “If we must develop as a nation, we must pay adequate attention to research and development, and allocate more fund to it. It is very unfortunate that most research carried out in the nation’s universities and institutes were not adequately funded, hence the poor results. “Nigeria, as we know today, has many research institutions with qualified researchers but has not been able to harness their full potentials due to poor funding”. He noted that research is capable of tackling the growing poverty and unemployment in the country if only the government would allocate more funds to research institutions scattered across the country. Popoola commended chairman of the governing board of PRODA, Enugu, Comrade Daniel Onjeh and the acting DG/CEO of PRODA, Dr. Fabian Okonkwo, for committing the little resources available to them to research and development in PRODA while ensuring industrial harmony and ending the perennial delays in conducting the promotion exercise in the institute. SSAUTHRIAI presented awards of honour to Onjeh and Okonkwo in appreciation.
