 BANKS profitability has improved over time and their stock values are cheap compared to Ghanaian and Kenyan bank stocks, a report by Coronation Asset Management  has stated. The report, entitled: “Nigerian Banks, Resilience Built In” captured the developments in the banking sector in the past 10 years. The report shows that  banks’ earnings have been resilient over the interest rate cycle. The report, written by Ope Ani and Guy Czartoryski of Coronation Research, examined what has happened within the banking industry during the decade of coverage. It focused on six listed banks. The report is a unique study of the margins and profitability of six listed banks namely Zenith Bank, GT Bank, Access Bank, FBN Holdings, UBA, and Stanbic IBTC. “These banks have adapted successfully to many changes in interest rates over the 10 years from 2010 to 2020. Therefore, they are well-positioned for the rise in rates in 2021,” the report said. “While underlying growth in assets has been elusive, especially when data are adjusted for inflation, profitability has generally improved. The return on average equity (RoAE) and return on average assets (RoAA) of the six banks studied have both converged and improved over 10 years. “This trend appears to be under-appreciated by investors, and the report shows the positive investment potential in the sector” says Czatoryski, a Senior Research Analyst.
