The Lagos State Athletics Association (LSAA) has endorsed the 10km Festac Half Marathon, which is scheduled to hold on Saturday, October 2. The event was endorsed after a meeting with the Vice-Chairman of LSAA Yusuf Alli. The Olympian lauded the organisers for their effort to promote and empower home-based athletes. He added that the marathon would help prepare athletes for future and stiffer challenges, adding he would lead a technical team to Festac on June 5 to inspect the route earmarked for the one-day event which is open to only local-based athletes. Organisers Lexicon Communications said that the target is to make the competition an annual event, with the aim of boosting the town’s relevance in the state’s social circuit, by showing the potentials of Festac in the discovery and promotion of world class athletes and entertainers.
