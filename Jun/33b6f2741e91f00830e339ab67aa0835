DAVID Moyes has been rewarded for guiding West Ham to sixth place in the Premier League with a new three year contract and says he is “really excited by the ambition” at the club. The 58-year-old Scot surpassed expectations in his second spell at the Hammers securing them a place in next season’s Europa League with 65 points, their highest Premier League tally. The previous season after replacing the sacked Manuel Pellegrini in December 2019 he had saved them from relegation. “We have made tremendous progress in the past 15 months and that has been a collective effort from everyone at the club,” said Moyes in a statement on the club website. “We must keep pushing boundaries for consistent improvement as we all aim to continue the growing of the club. “I am really excited by the ambition that we have at the club and we are going to work as hard as we possibly can to keep moving forward and hopefully give our supporters many a great memory.” Moyes is closing in on 100 matches in charge at West Ham and 1,000 competitive games as a manager. West Ham’s performances last season also helped to rebuild his reputation after underwhelming spells at Manchester United, Real Sociedad and Sunderland.
