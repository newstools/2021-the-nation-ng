Promising act, Neo Phlames has told a true-life story of how he was rejected by a lady due to tribal differences. The singer and songwriter said he has had his fair share of tribalism while discussing how his love interest rejected his proposal because they are of different ethnical backgrounds. “Carolina is a story of being rejected due to tribal differences. The issue of not being able to marry from a different tribe should be addressed before it gets out of hand. Well, I got my fair share of it and decided to turn it into a song. Anyone who listens carefully would understand”, said Neo Phlames. Speaking further, Neo said aside from the storyline, the upbeat song is very catchy and soothes every mood, and can also be enjoyed anywhere. According to the singer, there are more songs lined up for release till the year runs out. Asked which female artist he would love to work with within Nigeria, he said “Niniola! I am seriously in love with her sound and energy, I want to work with her because we have some similar vibes and in fact, I already have about three songs I want to feature her in. Also, I would love to work with Tiwa Savage and Yemi Alade. I know it will happen sooner than I can imagine.”
