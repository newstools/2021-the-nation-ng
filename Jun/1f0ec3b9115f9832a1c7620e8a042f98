The Bayelsa State Livestock Management Committee (BSLMC) has impounded 34 cows in Yenagoa, the state capital, over alleged violation of the state’s anti-open grazing law. The cows were impounded yesterday around the Bayelsa Palm area of the state capital. The Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Bill was passed into law about three months ago. The Chairman of the Livestock Management Committee and Commissioner for Agriculture in the state, Mr David Alagoa stated that the herders chose a convenient time in the night to graze, saying that some of the cows were spotted grazing in farmlands. He said the committee would follow the anti-open grazing law strictly, declaring that the impounded cows would remain in custody until necessary fees were paid before their release. Besides, there is also a movement by trekking from Bayelsa Palm to the Swali Slaughter and that tend to happen about 1:00 a.m. That is why you see that behind us, at the end of this road is Bayelsa Palm Estate and we were able to impound 34 cows last night. “We are going to follow the law. The law states that when we impound, there is also a fee to be paid in that process. We are going to follow the law.” The Special Adviser to the Governor on Security, Agberebi Akpoebi, said the committee was working in synergy with its local government components to ensure that the anti-open grazing law in the state is fully enforced. The Bayelsa State Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Operations, Aminu Alhassan, said a lot of sensitisation was carried out before the committee started to enforce the law. The DCP noted: “The management of the situation is very clear. We were all part of the law that brought about the anti-open grazing and we are very conversant with it. We have sensitised everybody and the way we have done it now, even the least person in the business of livestock is fully aware.”
