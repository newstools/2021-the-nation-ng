The Conservator-General, National Park Service Ibrahim Goni has denied any involvement in animals trafficking, stating that Nigeria is not a party to illegal wildlife trading. Goni spoke during the presentation of a parrot to the Federal Government through the Ministry of Environment in Abuja, pointing out that all agencies concerned are on their toes in ensuring that no animal is transported outside the country. He lamented that the National Park Service has been accused several times of being used as a conduit route and also being accused of illegal wildlife trading which he said were not true. Goni commended the Nigerian Agricultural Quarantine Service for confiscating the parrot and thwarting the effort of illegal wildlife traffickers. According to him, so far the parrots under the National Park Service care are now three.Â  He assured that with the level of synergy among agencies under the Ministry of Environment there will be transparency and quality coordination.
