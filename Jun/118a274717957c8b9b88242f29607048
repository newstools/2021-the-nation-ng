Nigeria’s Super Eagles and Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions will once again battle it out at the Stadion Wiener Neustadt in the second of a two-match-friendly in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Five-time African champions Cameroon edged the first encounter 1-0 at the same venue last Friday, courtesy of a 36th  minute strike by Andre Zambo Anguissa. Coach Gernot Rohr spoke at length about having to use a rash of new players in the first session, but he is compelled to do even more of that in today’s encounter following injuries to defenders William Ekong and Jamilu Collins, and the knock for winger Moses Simon. After last Friday’s game, Rohr said: “We missed seven key players due to injuries, so it was not our best team, but it was good to see other players. We are not happy to lose the game, but we saw some interesting new young players.” Friday’s defeat was Rohr’s first loss to Cameroon in four matches. The Eagles pounded the Lions 4-0 in Uyo and were held 1-1 in Yaounde in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches in September 2017, and then edged the Lions 3-2 in the Round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt two years ago. Captain Ahmed Musa said  defeat in Tuesday’s game is not an option. “We are not happy to have created so many chances and fail to score. We will approach the game differently on Tuesday. Cameroon is a big rival and we are not happy to have lost the game on Friday.” Goalkeeper Maduka Okoye added: “We have taken some positives from the first match against Cameroon. We had a good game and it was unfortunate that they scored with just that one shot on target. However, we have shown that we are ready for the AFCON with the strength of character we showed after conceding the goal. We are ready to go for it on Tuesday.”
