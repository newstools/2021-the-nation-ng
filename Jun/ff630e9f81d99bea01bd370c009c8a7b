The Juno awards (also popularly known as ‘JUNOS’) is the most prestigious award in Canadian music. The awards are presented annually by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (CARAS) to Canadian musical artists & bands to acknowledge their artistic & technical achievements in all aspects of music. JUNOS is often regarded as the Canadian equivalent of the British BRITs Awards or the American Grammys, and with half a century of pristine existence, is one of the biggest music awards in the world. Despite achieving success at such a young age, Tome didn’t seem to be resting on her laurels as she already released a new song earlier in the day before the award show titled ‘NANA’ which already looks set to become a Summer Hit. She’s currently working on another project titled ‘Dreams’ which will be released later this month.
