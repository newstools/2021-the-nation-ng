The Lagos State government has fined 27 private schools involved in examination malpractices N500,000 each. According to a statement by the Office of Education Quality Assurance, the fines followed their complicity in examination malpractice during the 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) and the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE). Director-General, OEQA, Mrs. Abiola Seriki-Ayeni, said the fine was a warning, adding that repeat offense would lead to the deregistration of the school. Chairman, Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM), Mrs. Elizabeth Ariyo, who led another investigation panel of enquiry involving 19 schools, warned them against breaching government’s trust by perpetrating examination malpractice “A level of trust has been reposed in schools to uphold the virtues of a qualitative educational system and not continue to bring disrepute to the state ministry of education,” she said. All indicted schools are to repeat Whole School Evaluation (WSE) and Subject Recognition Inspection (SRI) process with OEQA within the two years derecognition period as mandated by WAEC.
