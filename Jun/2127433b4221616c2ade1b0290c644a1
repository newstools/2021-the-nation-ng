According to him, election could not hold in Onitsha South due to the failure of the Returning Officers’ to conduct the election after collecting materials from the committee’s secretariat. The governor added that the Option A-4 method was adopted in the election, and blamed the delay on the failure of the contestants to supply 30 of their representatives as directed by the committee. According to him, only nine aspirants supplied their representatives as at 9am on Saturday. Abiodun explained that despite the minor hiccups, Returning Officers, backed  by security  escorts, were posted to the 326 Wards in the state, adding that “the process was free, fair, transparent and in line with the party’s guidelines, as promised by this committee’. He, however, debunked insinuations from some aspirants that the exercise was deliberately delayed, saying his committee only needed to be thorough and transparent. Abiodun added that the minor delay was not the fault of the committee or of party members, but of logistics. Senator Ifeanyi Ubah emerged candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) .
