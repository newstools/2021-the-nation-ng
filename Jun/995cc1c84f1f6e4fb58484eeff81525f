Senior Prophet Celestial Church of Christ Genesis Global, Israel Ogundipe has faulted gospel singer, Tope Alabi, for criticising a popular Christian song, Oniduro Mi. The Nation reports in a video making the rounds on social media, Tope Alabi said God isn’t her guarantor because He’s more than a guarantor. She said: “God is beyond being a guarantor to Man. I’m not saying that the song is not beautiful. However, when we receive heavenly inspiration to sing, there are some deliberations we must have with the Holy Spirit before we can bring out such a song. ”If we keep singing the gospel just as the Spirit-inspired, there is the possibility that we all will be singing absurdly. As gospel singers, God has given us the brain to digest, chew, and fully comprehend the inspiration given to us before we bring it to life.” But reacting, the popular cleric in the now-viral video, sang the song repeatedly to his congregation. He said: “Maybe you don’t know, if you don’t understand this song that song was actually for me. “My Oniduro is my advocate. He stood for me when many left me to my case and when some others ran away from me because they do not want to be identified with me. “It is better for God to stand for one than for man to because they will come back to haunt you with words. “I don’t know about you, you may be mate with God, but God is my own guarantor. Many people refused to stand for me. “I’m the one the artiste sang the song for, even when the courts were on strike, he stood for me.”
