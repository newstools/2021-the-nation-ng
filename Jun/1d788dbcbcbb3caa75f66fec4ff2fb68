Ondo Police Command on Thursday evening said the hijack of a school in Oba Ile community in Akure North local government was robbery and not kidnapping. Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami, told reporters it was ‘a pure case of robbery and not abduction.’ Salami assured the school bus taken away by the robbers would be recovered. He said the incident was not a case of kidnapping like in some parts of the country. “Initially we were thinking that the perpetrators would kidnap the lady but from all indication, they are after the school bus. “We all are on the trail of the robbers and arrest would be made as soon as possible. “We have told our men to be on the alert, especially those manning banks across the state. “I want to assure parents that it is a pure case of robbery. Thank God, the freed lady had told us that they spoke fluent Yoruba to her. “Hence, we have nothing to fear. It is not a case of banditry as experienced in some parts of the country,” Salami said.
