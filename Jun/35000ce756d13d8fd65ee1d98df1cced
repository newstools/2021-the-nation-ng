Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday re-launched the Jigi-Bola Free Sight and Hearing Aid Programme. The programme was conceived 20 years ago and implemented under former Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The Jigi-Bola initiative was an innovation to improve the vision of visually impaired residents, as well as borne out of the concern to reduce the negative effect of preventable visual impairment on the residents. At a ceremony at the Police College in Ikeja, the state capital, the governor said the re-launch of the initiative showed the commitment of his administration to improve the wellbeing and welfare of Lagosians.  The governor, who was represented by Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat, said: “Twenty years ago, our visionary, insightful and inspiring leader, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, out of genuine concern for the wellbeing of Lagosians, conceived an initiative to address the issue of growing preventable visual impairment among Lagosians. “This initiative, which was named Jigi-Bola under the Blindness Prevention Programme, offered free eye screening, free eye glasses and free surgical operations. Thousands of Lagosians who would have lost their sight as a result of inadequate awareness and lack of financial means benefited from this very laudable programme.”
