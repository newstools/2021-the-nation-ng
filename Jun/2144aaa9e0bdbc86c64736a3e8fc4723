A High Court in Akure, Ondo State has granted bail to a teenage EndSARS protester Kemisola Ogunniyi, who gave birth to a baby boy in custody last week. Justice Omolara Adejumo, granted her bail in the sum of N10m and a surety in like sum. The surety is to be residents in Akure and should show evidence of paying taxes. Kemisola was two months pregnant when she was arrested alongside four others for allegedly burning some buildings in Akure during the ENDSARS protest. Among the buildings torched were state secretariats of both the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), campaign office of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and some police divisions. Lawyer to Kemisola, Tope Tomekun, said the joy was that the naming ceremony of Kemisolaâ€™s baby would not hold inside the prison.
