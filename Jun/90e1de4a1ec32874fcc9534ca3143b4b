Anambra Governor Willie Obiano on Monday splashed medalists and coaches to the just concluded National Sports Festival (NSF) tagged Edo 2020 with N20 million. Obiano, who received them in his Aguleri home, Anambra East Local Government Area, applauded the team for their feat at the festival in spite of the challenges in the build up to the games. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Anambra won 37 medals including six gold, 20 silver and 22 bronze during the festival. Obiano gifted the medals with the sum of N1 Million, N500, 000 and N250, 000 for gold, silver and bronze respectively amounting to N16 million. The coaches also received cash rewards of about N3.5 million ranging from N1 million for the best coach at the festival and N150, 000 to bronze winning coaches. The cynosure of attraction was 10-year-old Stephanie Onusiriuka, the gymnast wonder kid at Edo 2020 who won one gold, two silver and one bronze and got a total of N2.250 million for her exploit. Onusiriuka held the governor and the rest of the audience spellbound with a two minutes display of gymnastic skills. “I am very proud of you, particularly that little girl that packed so much medal, she has a long way to go and the sky is her limit. “I want to commend everybody that won gold, silver and bronze, the challenge you have is that if you won bronze or silver, you must strive to win gold next time and if you won gold, you must defend it next time,” he said. Tony Oli, Chairman of Anambra State Sports Development Commission said the athletes and coaches did themselves proud by ensuring that the state surpassed its own record at the Abuja festival in 2018. Oli thanked the governor for providing the logistics needed to endure that Anambra did not only participate but compete favourably. He said some athletes from Anambra had been invited to national camp and would be part of Nigeria contingent to the Olympics. (NAN)
