The Super Eagles are determined to extend an unbeaten streak of five matches when they confront the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon today at the Stadion Wiener Neustadt in the Austrian capital in an international friendly. Three-time African champions Nigeria have not lost a match since they were edged by the odd goal by reigning African champions Algeria in an international friendly also in Austria in October 2020. Since then, they have drawn 1-1 with Tunisia’s Carthage Eagles in a friendly match; drawn 4-4 and 0-0 with Sierra Leone in back-to-back 2021 AFCON qualifying matches in November 2020; defeated Benin Republic 1-0 in Porto Novo in another 2021 AFCON qualifier and; walloped Lesotho 3-0 in the finale to the 2021 AFCON qualifying race in Lagos. Defender Anthony Izuchukwu, who plays for Sparta Trnava of Slovakia joined up with the Nigeria camp at the Hilton Garden Inn, Wiener Neustadt Österreich on Wednesday, taking the number of players in camp to 21. Both fierce rivals on the African continent will again clash in a second game also at the Stadion Wiener Neustadt in Vienna next Tuesday. Meanwhile, the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick has admitted that Super Eagles players have not been paid their bonuses for two years. He, however, denied speculations that some players withdrew from the Cameroon friendly because of unpaid bonuses. Pinnick in an interview on Arise TV said: “Players did not back out because of the fact that their bonuses were not paid. No Nigerian national team player survives on bonuses or allowances. The national team adds value to players and we are not proud that we are owing. A lot of circumstances in the last two years made us not to meet up with our obligations.”
