Gospel artiste Tope Alabi has appreciated her fans for support after she was widely criticised for her statement on singer Adeyinka Alayesori’s smash hit, ‘Oniduro Mi’. The “Ore ti o common” coroner took to her verified Instagram page on Sunday to appreciate fans for their support over the past few days. The film music composer, while reciting a poem, wrote: “Appreciation to everyone: Those He saves are His delight, Christ will hold us fast; precious in His holy sight, He will hold us fast. “He’ll not let our souls be lost; His promises shall last; Bought by Him at such a cost, He will hold every one of us fast.” Alabi continued: “I register my unreserved appreciation to you all for standing by and for me through the past week. The Lord will never leave us all in Jesus’ name. Thank you all and may the good God bless you all in Jesus’ name. Amen.”
