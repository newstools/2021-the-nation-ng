An unidentified visitor to the Nigeria Correctional Service, Okere in Warri South council area of Delta state, has been shot dead. Unconfirmed reports claimed the visitor was shot dead by a security operative within the facility on Tuesday afternoon. It was gathered the victim had gone to the correctional facility to visit a friend, whose identity could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report. A source told The Nation the victim was in possession of some substances suspected to be cocaine as well as other food items during a routine check for visitors. This reportedly led to the arrest and interrogation of the suspect, who was gunned down as he attempted to escape. He was said to have been shot twice. Following the incident, which caused tension in the area, residents were made to raise up their hands while passing by the facility Tuesday evening. Vehicles were also prevented from plying the route. However, activities appeared to have returned to normal around the facility’s axis of Okere Road, when The Nation visited Wednesday morning. Vehicles were only allowed to ply a single lane, just as the heavy presence of security operatives were observed around the vicinity. The acting Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed that a visitor to the Okere correctional facility was shot dead but did not disclose who shot the visitor and why. “As for the person who went to visit the inmate, I know he was shot and he died. I don’t have the fact to know who actually shot. The information I have does not state who shot or who was arrested for the incident for now. Investigation is ongoing,” Edafe said.
