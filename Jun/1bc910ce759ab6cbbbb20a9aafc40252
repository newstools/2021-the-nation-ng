Fidelity Bank remains committed to putting smiles on its customers’ faces by enriching their lives through its ongoing savings loyalty programme. To mark this year’s Children’s Day, the bank gave out N150, 000 to 62 Sweet Account (SWEETA) holders across the country, for a total of N9.3 million. As part of its efforts to deepen customer engagement, the bank readjusted its approach with respect to the loyalty scheme. Under the auspices of the loyalty scheme, the bank presented cheques to the beneficiaries of the loyalty scheme at various children’s events organised by Bounty Kiddies Bites & Event, Kastina; Zeelove Event Management; Pamvilla Primary & Secondary School; Refiner School; Ilepeju Junior & Senior Secondary School; Orphanage Home, IDP camp throughout Kastina, Niger, Abuja, Lagos, and so on. Commenting on this initiative, Fidelity Bank CEO, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, pointed out that all-around quality education remains a strong anchor in raising tomorrow’s children and breeding exceptional children who can compete globally. “This is why we have decided to contribute our quota as a bank by offering school fees support to select Nigerian children.
