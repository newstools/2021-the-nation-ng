The Bayelsa State Police Command says its operatives have apprehended a suspected fake surgeon Akpoviri Vincent Jimmy aged 29. The suspect was nabbed for alleged impersonation of Dr. Charles Umeh serving in Taraba State. The suspect, who claimed to be a graduate of Psychology from the Delta State University, Abraka, was arrested at a popular private hospital, identified as Tobis Hospital, while trying to secure employment as a surgeon. Commissioner of Police Mike Okoli, while parading the suspect before reporters at the Police Headquarters Yenagoa, on Wednesday, said the imposter had been seeking employment from hospitals within Delta and Bayelsa states as a medical doctor. A middle-aged man, Brian Anucha, was arrested for parading as an employee of the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHEDC) and defrauding residents of Rivers State. The suspect was reportedly apprehended in the Aba Road area of Port Harcourt after allegedly defrauding a customer, Emmanuel Nte, N220,000.
