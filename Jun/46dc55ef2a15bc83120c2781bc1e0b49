Nigeria international Brian Idowu has joined Khimki on a permanent deal from fellow Russian Premier League club Lokomotiv Moscow. The left-back spent the 2020/21 season on loan with Khimki where he scored three goals and provided two assists in 30 appearances across all competitions. Idowu is pleased to have signed a two-year contract with Khimki with an option of a year extension. “I liked what we were able to do with Khimki last season,” Idowu told the club website. “It was a good football year for the team, a good season for me individually, and I want the next one to be even better.” “I feel comfortable here: great guys, qualified coaching staff. Lots of ambition, I wonder what will happen next and what we can show together with this team. ” The last time Idowu was called up by Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr was against Ukraine in an international friendly match in September 2019. The 29-year-old will be hoping to impress the German tactician when the new 2021/22 season starts with the Super Eagles set to start their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign in September 2021. He has played 10 international matches for Nigeria and scored one goal.
