Seventy-one-year-old Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje says he will remain politically active after the  expiration of his second term in 2023. He has spent 43 years in politics, having started in 1978. Although Ganduje was not categorical on whether or not he would contest another election, he  said his eyes would  be wide open for the good of the country. The governor stated this while fielding questions from reporters  on the Democracy Day celebrations  in Kano yesterday. Asked if  he would toe the path of his Katsina State counterpart, Aminu Bello Masari, who recently said he would quit  politics in 2023, Ganduje replied: “Maybe he (Masari) is tired. I am not. “I am not tired anyway; neither will I resign nor retire from politics. You know I have been in politics since 1978. In 2023, my eyes will still be open,”. On the  jostle  to succeed him by some people, including those in his cabinet, the governor declared: “Our  party (All Progressives Congress) delegates will choose my successor when the time comes,” ”You asked of qualities; if I tell you the qualities I want from my successor, you will be able to make a computation, matching the qualities of the aspirants,  then you will say that is the anointed one. Delegates will do that.” Ganduje also said   delegates would pick the presidential candidate for the ruling party. On completion of projects before May 29, 2023, Ganduje said: “We inherited many capital projects. Some are being completed and some are still ongoing. We are not neglecting any. ”We are determined to complete all the projects we started. We shall complete all the projects, except those that cannot be completed because of their nature, and  government is a continuum.”
