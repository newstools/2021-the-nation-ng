A woman Omolara Solanke, 46, has been arrested for allegedly defrauding a local council chair aspirant in Osun State. The Nation gathered that Omolara and five others allegedly assured the 48-year-old aspirant Rasaq Salami of winning the election with the aid of some spiritual forces. A source said that Salami was taken to Ekiti State where they allegedly took N2,680,000 but could not provide the spiritual materials promised. “Salami lodged a complaint with the anti-fraud unit of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Ekiti State, which led to Solanke’s arrest,” the source said. NSCDC spokesman Daniel Adigun, in a statement yesterday said, “We arrested one Solanke Omolara who collected N2,680,000 along with five others now at large from the complainant named Rasaq Salami  to help him to secure victory in the forthcoming local government election in Osun State. “The complaint later reported the case to our men in Ekiti State because the money was collected there, the signal was sent to us and we tracked and arrested one of them, Omolara.”
