He said::“My father members calling my dad from nowhere saying, Okay, Denrele is 40, is he not going to get married? “And I said, tell that woman to call me herself, let me address the issue because she has no say in my issues. I fell in love, fell out of love and been heartbroken severally. “Now I’ve not been in too many relationships which is why I am always skeptical about getting into them. “So one day, I said to myself, okay, so maybe the girls do not have anything to offer me, and then I have quite a bit of male attention. “Okay, lemme just give somebody a chance which ended to be the worst decision I have ever taken in my life. And from then on I have said, right now, I am my own sugar daddy. I have a strong masculine side designed to take care of my feminine side. So, I don’t need anybody.” Denrele added: “The person I now decided to experiment with, I said okay, lemme just give this a shot. That was the most draining thing I have ever done in my life and I said I am never going to be caught in that sort of situation.”
