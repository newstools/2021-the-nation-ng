Champions Manchester City face a trip to Tottenham on the opening weekend of the 2021-22 Premier League season. The first fixtures will take place on August 14 and newly promoted Brentford will host Arsenal in their first top-flight game since the 1946-47 season. Norwich and Watford, who were also promoted last season, face Liverpool and Aston Villa respectively. Manchester United play Leeds at Old Trafford, while Champions League winners Chelsea host Crystal Palace. Premier League clubs were able to host fans at reduced capacity when Covid-19 restrictions eased late in the 2020-21 campaign. It is not yet known how many fans will be able to attend the opening fixtures of the new season but the Premier League said it was “committed to the ambition of having full stadiums, including away supporters” from the start of the season. The men’s and women’s Wimbledon finals will become the first UK outdoor sporting events to host capacity crowds in July, while Wembley will also be able to host matches at 50 percent capacity – about 45,000 – for the knockout stages of Euro 2020.
