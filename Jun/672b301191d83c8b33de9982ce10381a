Singer Oluwatosin Ajibade aka Mr Eazi has declared himself the king of Afro dancehall. The 29-year-old Port Harcourt-born who pioneered the Banku music, a fusion sound he describes as a mixture of Ghanaian highlife and Nigerian chord progressions and patterns, shared a video of himself freestyling to an Afro dancehall beat. The “emPawa Africa” CEO then went ahead to tag Ghanaian dancehall artist Shatta Wale to the post challenging him on the title of the king of Afro dancehall. The video text reads: “Yo @shattawalenima I am now the King of Afro Dancehall you have 24hrs to reply!! #sekkleandbop” In March, the ‘Already’ crooner took to his Twitter page shortly after the 63rd Grammy Awards Ceremony to call out his fellow Ghanaians for criticizing Ghanaian artists after Nigerian music stars, Burna Boy and Wizkid copped Grammy awards
Wale mocked Ghanaians for preferring Nigerian music to their local music. He further went on to describe them as “sellouts”.
