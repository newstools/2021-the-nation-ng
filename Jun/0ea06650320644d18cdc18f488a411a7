Micro blogging and social network service platform Twitter stated it has informed the Federal Government of its willingness to meet over the suspension of its operations in Nigeria. The Federal Government last Friday suspended Twitter’s operation in Nigeria on the basis accusing the social media giant of allowing its platform to be used to threaten the country’s cooperate existence. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed told reporters on Wednesday that Twitter’s management is seeking a “high-level discussion” to resolve the issue that led to the suspension. Confirming the Minister’s comment, Twitter said on Friday: “Today marks one week since Twitter was blocked in Nigeria. We have informed the Nigerian government that we are ready to meet for an open discussion to address mutual concerns and see the service restored. We remain advocates for the free and #OpenInternet everywhere. #KeepitOn.”
