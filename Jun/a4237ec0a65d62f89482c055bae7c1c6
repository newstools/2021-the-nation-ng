An emeritus director of the Warri Choral Society (WCS), Pa Joe Ayomike and his wife, Chinyere have been found dead at their residence in Warri GRA, Delta state. The deceased couple, renowned for their love for classical music in Nigeria, were discovered Monday morning. The late WCS director was younger brother to former chairman of the Itsekiri Leaders of Thoughts and historian, late Pa Johnson Oritsegbubemi Sunday Ayomike. His wife, fondly called Chi-Chi was a senior lecturer at the Delta State University, Abraka. Though details surrounding their deaths were not clear as of press time, the whereabouts of their security detail is reportedly unknown. The late Ayomike founded the WCS in 1992 and organised a two-hour classical music concert, conducted by his wife, from time to time. Acting Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), DSP Edafe Bright confirmed the incident but could not say what led to their deaths. “Yes, it is confirmed but I can’t say for now what led to his death or his wife. No arrest has been made so far,” the PPRO said.
