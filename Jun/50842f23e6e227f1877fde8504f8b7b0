Chief Executive Officer of a leading estate developing company, Periwinkle Luxury Lifestyle Condo,  Chiedu Nweke, has said the company’s decision to invest $20m in the building of a 15 storey luxury lifestyle condos was to make a statement that smart cities in Singapore and Dubai can be replicated in Nigeria. Speaking yesterday at the signing ceremony for the acquisition of 2,400 square metres of land at Eko Atlantic City on Victoria Island, Lagos, Nweke said the “intention of the Pan Atlantis Condos (apartments) was to challenge similar developments in places like Singapore and Dubai”. He recalled that “in 2009, we met with the Chairman of Eko Atlantic City and promised to collaborate with him to drive the dream of stirring a global challenge of providing world class luxury condos. Nweke said: “We are not here to build run-on-the mill condos, we want to send a clear message that there are also big players in Nigeria capable of doing big things. “We are therefore forerunners in the area of providing this niche service and in no time, we aspire to be the leaders in this business.” Nweke disclosed that  15 floor high rise would have  three suspended podia, swimming pool, three floor park and corridors at the Atlantic City. The $20m high rise will be delivered in 30 months. Managing Director of Eko Atlantic David Frame explained that “the concept is to develop a world class city matching global standards.” Chief Operating Officer, Tunde Olatunde described Periwinkle Luxury Lifestyle Condos as a premium developer in Nigeria. While stressing that the company’s vision was to build the biggest and tallest condos in Nigeria and Africa, Olatunde said the project would churn out world class luxury three bedroom condos that would be sold. Chief Operating Officer (COO) Hassan Jaafar also spoke on the ability of his company to deliver the project in 30 months.
