Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare has warned against discrimination of home-based players in the Super Eagles. The minister gave the warning on Tuesday when he paid a visit to the Super Eagles training camp at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja ahead of their departure for the Mexico friendly. Dare expressed surprise that Super Eagles gaffer Gernot Rohr was not present at the camp to take charge of proceedings. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) had drafted the Head of Technical Department, Austine Equaveon to take charge of the preparation. Eguaveon had maintained that Rohr was giving input to the team and part of the training sessions. Dare said “Gernot Rohr was employed by Nigerians, therefore, he should not discriminate those he wants to coach. “Both home-based and foreign-based players exhibit great talents and they all must be respected and treated well”. The minister consequently directed the NFF to ensure Rohr is more professional and abide by the dictate of his contract. “NFF must call him to order and ensure he abides by the contract he signed,” he added. The Super Eagles will play Mexico in an international friendly on July 3, in the U.S.(NAN)
