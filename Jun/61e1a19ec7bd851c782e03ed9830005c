Actress Nnaji Charity has tackled movie producers accusing them of being responsible for the high rate of bleaching in the movie industry. According to the film star, movie producers have obstinately refused to invest in acquiring good cameras that could actually aid them in shooting top-notch pictures for their movies. She noted these producers prefer to shoot with fair girls and put pressure on the others to bleach their skin colour so they can also become fair thereby get chosen to feature in movies. Charity shared the post via her Insta story. She said: “Too many fair girls in Nollywood and believe me movie producers are the reason for the high rate of bleaching in the industry. “Invest in a good camera to shoot your film you refuse now you want girls to bleach their ass out before your movie can come out colorful in Africa Magic and co ,,nonsense.”
