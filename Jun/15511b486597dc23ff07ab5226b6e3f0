Managing Director, Revolution Plus Property Limited, Mr. Bamidele Onalaja has called on economic managers to make land documentation seamless to address the nation’s huge housing deficit. He noted that the move is apt to bridge the country’s housing deficit with currently stands at 18 million. He stated this at the unveiling ceremony of Revolution Plus Property being the official real estate partner of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Onalaja also noted that to address the nation’s housing deficit, required intensive collaboration between the federal government and the private sectors in the housing sector of the economy. “We are working round the clock to address this situation. The government must partner the private sector, make lands available and most importantly, ensure a seamless land documentation procedure to help us achieve our aim to bridge the housing deficit to the barest minimum,”Onalaja said. On the partnership with NFF, he said would give footballers and football fans both home and abroad the opportunity to own houses of their own at affordable prices. “We are aware that these players cannot play football all through their lifetimes, so this is why we are partnering with NFF to get access to these footballers and fans to showcase our flexible and affordable housing products across the country,” Onalaja said. Also speaking, President of NFF, Amaju Pinnick, commended the company for their support towards sports development, saying that investing in property is a good step towards achieving life time goals.
