 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday slammed the All Progressives Congress (APC) governors and the Federal Government for falling over themselves to poach PDP governors amid growing insecurity. At a news conference in Abuja before the defection of Governor Matawalle, PDP National Chairman Prince Uche Secondus berated the leadership of the APC for “chasing after the wind”. Secondus said: “Let me also emphasise that APC governors and government of APC are overbearing on the system and moving to poach our governors, and this to them is an achievement. “I have never seen where you have economic crisis, insecurity crisis, then the ruling party goes poaching governors. As published in the social media, 18 governors will be leaving their states for Zamfara, to celebrate the killings of innocent citizens and ravages of hunger in Zamfara State. This is a shame and it is laughable.  “They are going after our governors but we are going after the masses of this country. The governors have one vote but we are after the people, the masses, the people who are suffering under this government. “The masses are solidly behind us, the masses are for the PDP and we stand here to state clearly that we shall form the new government come 2023 because of the masses and not because of the governors.” According to the PDP chair, “it’s a shame that some PDP governors were intimidated to defect to the APC and that they left for the ruling party out of fear. “It is a shame for all the governors that left the PDP out of fear. They were intimidated by the instrument of this government. But I am happy that the masses in their states, especially in Zamfara did not leave with them.” “From all indications, Governor Bello Matawalle has lost memory of how he came to become the governor of Zamfara State and he needed to be reminded that no law allows him to cross over to any other party with the statutory mandate given to PDP through the ballot box.”
