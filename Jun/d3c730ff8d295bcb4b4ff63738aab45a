Gunmen have razed Ashaka Police Station in Ndokwa East LGA, Delta State. The armed men, numbering over 20, stormed the station at the wee hours of Sunday, shot sporadically and set the station on fire. Ashaka Police Station is the third station attacked in the state in the last one month. A patrol van was also set ablaze during the raid. It was learnt no casualty was recorded in Sunday’s attack though previous attacks claimed seven officers. Acting Public Relations Officer of Delta Police Command, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed no life was lost. Edafe said the hoodlums also burnt down a patrol van within the station. He vowed that such attacks would “not deter the police from providing the needed security in any community in Delta State. “The hoodlums who perpetrated this dastardly act will certainly not go free, as serious efforts are on to arrest them and bring them to book.” In a related development, Edafe said operatives of the command have raided a den of criminals, killing six suspects in a gun duel. The suspects including Efe Oyenikoro, Felix George, Emmanuel Job and Joan Yapiteghe, were in a Sienna bus marked LSR 813 XL along Patani-Bayelsa road when they were intercepted by operatives on stop and search mission. He said other suspects fled with injuries into the bush, adding one AK 47 rifle, one pump action gun, one AK 47 magazine with 25 live ammunition were recovered. Edafe added that four suspects were also arrested with one locally made Barretta pistol in their possession.
