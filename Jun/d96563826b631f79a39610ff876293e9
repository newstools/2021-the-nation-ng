NOLLYWOOD actress Wunmi Toriola has said that fans judge her by the roles she plays in movies without meeting her. The actress who plies her trade in the Yoruba sector of Nollywood said this during a live interview on Instagram. Toriola noted that though she naturally has a loud and angry-like voice, she’s the opposite of the characters she plays in movies. “You can see the way I’m talking now, it seems as if we are fighting but that is how my voice is and the roles I play in movies don’t help the situation at all because people judge me by the roles I play,” she said. Continuing, she said, “Really, I’m a blunt person and I have a low tolerance. I don’t like negativity and that is part of me so while I’m growing, I’m growing to start being accommodating more, I’m growing to start loving more so. People judge me base on the roles although I have some atom of it because I don’t take a shit. I won’t deny it on air because I’m trying to look good and I am too blunt which is why people have problems with me.”
