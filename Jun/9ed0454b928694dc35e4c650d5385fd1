One person was hospitalized Thursday afternoon following a bloody clash by suspected cultists at the popular Garki motor park, Awkunanaw, Enugu State. The shooting sparked off panic and pandemonium as people ran helter-skelter for safety. The two cult groups in the area were said to have engaged in a supremacy battle to gain control of the area. This violence followed the killing of a 33-year-old man identified as Emeka at Obosi Street, Ogui New Layout Wednesday night by suspected cultists. Residents around the Mayor Bus Stop also started running as the news of the attack in nearby Garki got to them. Eyewitnesses said the gunmen also robbed some of their victims at the park snatching phones before making good their escape. The Garki Park is located inside the Garki market which is one of the largest markets in Enugu, the state capital. A source, who spoke in confidence, said the war started around 9 pm on Wednesday, adding that an unidentified person was shot in the process. The police confirmed the incident but stated that the victim was receiving treatment in the hospital. A statement by the spokesman of the state police command, Daniel Ndukwe, said, “Following a distress call received at Awkunanaw Police Division today, 03/06/2021 at about 1300hrs, alleging that a young man was shot by suspected cultists, along Agbani Road, close to Garki Market, Awkunanaw Enugu; Police Operatives swiftly moved to the scene, secured and rushed the victim to a nearby hospital, where he is responding treatment.” Ndukwe added that the commissioner of police, Mohammed Aliyu, had ordered the Anti-Cultism Unit of the Command to conduct a discreet investigation to fish out and bring the assailants to book.
