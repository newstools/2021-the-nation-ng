BBNaija’s ex-Housemate, Bright O has said Prince, is financially incapable to date Nengi. Bright O made the allegation during the Tuesday night, June 29, 2021, episode of the BBNaija Reunion show. The show host, Ebuka, had played a video of Bright O and Tochi discussing relationships in the house and he said Prince does not have the financial muscle to date Nengi. When Ebuka queried Tochi about what he said, he stuttered as he gave a not- too convincing response. Tochi’s response proved that he wasn’t proud of what he said despite claiming he isn’t afraid of any of the ex-housemate. Responding to the question, Bright O admittedly said he had that conversation with Tochi and there was nothing to hide about it. When queried further, BrightO said he knew that Nengi travels a lot and had visited several countries and he’s sure Prince is not financially capable to fund her trips let alone other things. A calm Prince, who watched on without interjecting, said he’s not surprised but he understands why ex-housemates like BrightO and others have such perception about him. He went on to say he decides to look broke like Bright O because he doesn’t want him or others coming to him with financial requests, hence, no one knows his financial abilities and capabilities.
