Belgium captain Eden Hazard has admitted that he will not be in top condition for his country’s opening Euro 2020 game against Russia. The winger has had an injury-plagued two years at Real Madrid and is still short of full fitness, casting doubt on what his role may be for Belgium at the tournament. The Red Devils kick off their tournament on Saturday and Hazard’s preparation has been less than ideal. “I’ve only had one full week of training,” Hazard told Belgian media channel RTBF. “We’ll see, with the medical team what I’ll do for the first match. “To begin with, it will be the head coach’s decision, but I’m still not 100 percent so we’ll see what we’ll do.” The 30-year-old has been unable to gain any consistency in the last two seasons and joined the Belgian camp still struggling with some niggles in his leg.
