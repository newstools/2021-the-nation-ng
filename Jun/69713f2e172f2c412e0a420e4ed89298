Popular Nigerian songstresses, Tiwa Savage and Seyi Shay are currently at loggerheads over some allegations of name-calling and mudslinging. A video of Tiwa Savage and Seyi Shay in a shouting match in a salon recently surfaced online. Investigations revealed that the four minutes long videos- posted in two parts on Instagram – was shared by social media influencer, Tunde Ednut. In the first video, Seyi Shay walked up to Tiwa to say hi and Tiwa wasn’t having it. The mother of one said she won’t accept any form of cordial greetings from Seyi Shay. The former Mavin Records first lady said she won’t respond to Seyi after all the insults that Seyi and Victoria Kimani have heaped on her over the years. Tiwa went further to say, “Don’t say hi to me ever. Let the sleeping dogs lie. Shey you blocked me on Instagram? block me in real life too. We are not friends.” The singer went on to narrate how Seyi Shay and Victoria Kimani had continued to dish out insults to her over the years through their songs and interviews but had maintained a calm position until the greetings. In 2019, Seyi Shay and Victoria Kimani, alongside Tiwa Savage and numerous Nigerian music acts had jumped on Kizz Daniel’s hit single, ‘Fvck you’. Tiwa Savage had alleged that both Seyi and Kimani directed insults at her in their song but she had decided to take it in her stride and let sleeping dogs lie.
