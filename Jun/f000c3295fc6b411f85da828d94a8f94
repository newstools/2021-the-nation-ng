Slovakia gained a shock victory over 10-man Poland in their European Championship Group E opener in St Petersburg. Milan Skriniarâ€™s fine low shot on the turn from the edge of the penalty area secured the three points for Slovakia, a country ranked 36th in the world. They had taken an early lead when the ball bounced off the post and rebounded in off Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after a fine run and shot from Robert Mak. A lovely one-touch move, calmly finished by Karol Linetty, brought the Poles level early in the second half. But the 62nd-minute dismissal of Poland midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak for a second booking changed the momentum of the match and Skriniar and Slovakia took full advantage seven minutes later. The other two nations in Group E, Spain and Sweden, face each other in Seville in the late game on Monday. BBC
