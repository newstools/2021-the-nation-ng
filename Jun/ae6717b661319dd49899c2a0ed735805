The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), yesterday demanded immediate suspension of the 1999 Constitution review to enable the Federal Government to organise a referendum which would lead to the actualisation of the Biafra Republic. CNG also appealed to the government to invite the United Nations, the African Union and Economic Community of West African State (ECOWAS), to initiate the process of self-determination to mandate the Biafrans out of the Nigerian union by leveraging on the several relevant international treaties and conventions to which Nigeria is a signatory. While addressing reporters in Abuja, its spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman maintained that the outcome of the referendum must be irreversible or reconsidered for any other reasons. His words: “We demanded the immediate suspension of the ongoing exercise for the review of the 1999 Constitution and to concentrate on the first priority of determining who and what constitutes Nigeria as a country in the present circumstance in which the Igbo have foreclosed every hope for the rest of us to continue co-existing with them as one country. “In order to achieve the final separation of the Igbo from the rest of Nigeria, we demand that the National Assembly organise a referendum by seeking the cover of the same Doctrine of Necessity invoked by Nigeria’s Federal Parliament paved way for former President Goodluck Jonathan’s takeover by declaring the late President Umaru Musa Yaradua unfit. “We demand that the NASSS to prevail on the Federal Government to invite the United Nations as well as the African Union and ECOWAS, to initiate the process of self-determination to mandate the Biafrans out of the Nigerian union by leveraging on the several relevant international treaties and conventions to which Nigeria is a signatory.” Sulieman explained that the group took the decision to prevent another Civil War sequel to the spate of killings and destruction of public infrastructure in the Southeast. Sulieman urged the North to “remain the bulwark of respect, integrity, dignity, decorum, tradition, decency, morality, civilisation, etiquette, good behaviour, politeness, accommodation, and all other positive traits with the assurance that the goodwill prevail over evil.”
