Gernot Rohr has handed a late call-up to Ujpest defender Vincent Onovo as the replacement for injured William Troost-Ekong ahead of Nigeria’s second friendly match against Cameroon today. Troost-Ekong picked up an injury towards the end of Friday’s game and he was replaced by Galatasaray defender Valentine Ozornwafor. The Watford star has reportedly left Vienna for further medical examinations, while Collins remains a doubt and he awaits a late fitness test. Onovo who is based in Hungary, has joined the Super Eagles in Austria and he is a key player in Michael Oenning’s team that finished sixth in the Hungarian top-flight table this season. He also helped Ujpest win the Magyar Kupa (Hungarian Cup) which will make them participate in the second round of the 2021-22 Europa Conference League. He has been at the club since 2018 and made 35 appearances in all competitions for the club last season. The 22-year-old becomes the latest player to be handed a first call-up after Terem Moffi, Valentine Ozornwafor and Abraham Marcus.
