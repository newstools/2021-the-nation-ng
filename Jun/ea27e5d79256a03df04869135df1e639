  A pest control expert, Tolu Caleb, has said that those who live close to dumpsites are at great risk of falling ill from pest infestation. Caleb, Managing Director of Rotimax Integrated Services Ltd, who spoke at a briefing to mark the 2021 World Pest Control Day globally marked every June 6, urged Nigerians to take pest control seriously. He lamented that about 300,000 Nigerians, mostly children, die of malaria yearly while millions of others die or are harmed by Lassa fever, Salmonellosis, typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, leprosy, plague, among others, following failure to control pests. “Proper pest control can keep you safe from the illnesses and allergies that pests bring into homes.
“Every method from simple cleaning to professional spraying makes it harder for pests to cause problems,” he said. He called on the government to remove dumpsites near residential houses, saying it is the first step in eradicating pest infestation.
