Over 70 members of various cult groups in Ikere-Ekiti, headquarters of Ikere Local Government Area of Ekiti State, have renounced cultism. They also surrendered their firearms. Traditional ruler of the community, Oba Adejimi Adu who disclosed this on Wednesday in his palace, said that the voluntary renunciation was as a result of adoption of traditional strategies by the community. Oba Adu said the resort to traditional means followed the failure of the police and other security agencies to checkmate the activities of cultists in the town. He noted that the incessant cult clashes in the town whichÂ  claimed 12 lives recently, prompted Ogoga-in-Council to organise a renunciation programme with a promise that no one would be arrested or prosecuted. The monarch said that 70 cultists from various cult groups voluntarily renounced their membership and swore not to be involved in cultism forthwith.
