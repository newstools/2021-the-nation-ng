Moses Simon has promised the Super Eagles will react very well to the 1-0 loss to Cameroon Friday night when both teams do battle again on Tuesday. Nigeria failed to make the most of the many chances they created only to be punished by the more clinical Indomitable Lions. “We hope to do our best in the next game,” assured the winger, who stood out for the Eagles in the first match on Friday. “I believe the team will react very well on Tuesday.” Moses Simon said he also understands that the fans did not take kindly to the loss even though it was a test game. “We always knew this will not be an easy game,” he said. “It was a friendly, but we know the fans only want their team to win always. “Unfortunately, we did not win this friendly.”
