After 13 weeks of battling with other finalists for season 2 of Street Foodz Naija, a reality cooking television show, Fajana Oluwafemi Adegboyega of La Krim Foods has emerged the winner. The docu-series mirrors cooking competition on global food channels by showcasing the best street delicacies through the culinary prowess of 13 contestants, who slugged it out for 12 weeks, evading elimination stages and progressing to the finale. Held at the Alao Aka-Bashorun Park, Gbagada, Lagos, the grand finale of the cooking competition by FoodBay TV, a part of Maxima Media Group, was spiced with live music performance before the stage was eventually set for the final battle. Hosted by BBNaija’s Elozonam Ogbolu, other finalists in the cooking competition include Chinenye Okam (Native chef), Alimi Akorede (Korede Spaghetti), Patrick Atigogo (Chef Chencko), and Owoeye Damilare (ChefDNaija). Fajana stole the hearts of all three judges, including America’s Chef Alex McCoy, Chef Ette Assam, and Chef Tosan Jemide with his potato pancakes and a side of chicken sauce. Fajana was overwhelmed with the judges’ reaction and the eventual announcement of him as the winner. He thanked his supportive teammates, ending the speech with, “now I feel like a king.” Speaking at the event, Oluwafemi Ogundoro, CEO of Maxima Media Group, emphasised FoodBay TV’s role in closing the gap between the international audience and local African cuisines.
