The winner of the BBNaija season 5, Mercy Eke, has revealed her readiness to make babies. The reality TV star was in a romantic relationship with Ike, her fellow BBNaija former housemate which many thought would metamorphose into something more permanent. However, a couple of months after their exit from the reality TV show, their relationship packed up over lack of commitment. Though she claimed to be married after her breakup with Ik, there has been no pictorial evidence or video of it.
In a more recent post shared on her Snapchat, Lambo expressed her readiness to bear babies, noting she’s ready. She attributed the strong urge to repeated dreams of having a baby in recent times.
She wrote: “I want a baby like I have been dreaming of it. God, I’m ready.” Mercy’s post was also accompanied by several emojis of pregnant women and babies.
