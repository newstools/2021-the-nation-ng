Disturbed by the kidnapping of 104 students of Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, the  Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN) has urged the Federal Government to ensure the release of the students without causing further pains to their parents and guardians as well as the students. In a statement in Abuja, ASCSN Acting National President, Comrade Tommy Etim Okon, and the Secretary-General, Comrade Alade Bashir Lawal, stated that the kidnapping of the 104 students and four teachers of Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State was further proof that  security had continued to deteriorate. “We call on the Federal Government to urgently rejig the security architecture in the country and ensure that there is a synergy among security agencies as well as the communities to improve the security situation. “It is common knowledge that no society can develop if the government cannot guarantee safety of lives and property of the citizens,” the union stated.   According to the ASCSN, since President Muhammadu Buhari recently urged State Governments and traditional rulers to secure their domains instead of waiting for the Federal Government, the State Governments must take up the challenge to strengthen Vigilante Groups in their states and provide them with necessary tools to confront terrorists, bandits, and kidnappers.
