Celebrity stylist, Yomi Makun aka Yomi Casual, has urged celebrities to always save for the future and not invest in material things. Yomi gave this advice in one of his numerous Instagram posts. “Many people lack discipline when it comes to saving money. What good is having a bunch of stuff if you’re struggling in debt, or broke most of the time? So many people put up a front like they’ve got it going on, but they know the truth,” he began. Continuing, he said, “They spend all of their money trying to look important, and/or keep up an image. Knowledge is everything! Educate yourself about money, investing, and saving. I encourage you to start investing in yourself instead of things! Set yourself up for a better future and start making better choices”. Makun further advised that building wealth is not rocket science as it would take time and commitment. “Building wealth takes time! Have discipline. Save. Stay consistent. Be brave enough to change your spending habits. Be wise! Don’t allow money to control you. Strive to have a healthy relationship with money”.
