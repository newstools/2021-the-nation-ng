  After several attempts at picking his tickets early to Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan, Quadri Aruna finally secured a spot at Tokyo following his world rating by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).  In his first attempt at berthing in Tokyo at the African Olympics Qualifying Tournament in Tunis, Aruna copped an injury to withdraw from the tournament while his second attempt during the World Olympics Qualifying Tournament in Doha, Qatar, he was beaten in the first round by a Russian sensation.  But yesterday, the world table tennis ruling body through a letter addressed to the President of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) and President of the Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF) and signed by ITTF Competition Director Gabor Felegyi confirmed the eventual qualification of Aruna.  Being the first African in the history of the Olympic Games to make it to the quarter-final stage of the singles event, Aruna will be making his third appearance at the Olympic Games having featured in London 2012 and Rio 2016.  “It is with great pleasure, I advise the qualification of Quadri Arena to compete in the table tennis Men’s Singles event at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, on the basis of World Ranking allocation according to the June 2021 ITTF Olympic Qualification Ranking,” Felegyi stated.  He, however, stated that NOC is expected to confirm Aruna’s participation on or before June 16.  ****** With this development, Aruna will join his compatriots – Olajide Omotayo, Olufunke Oshonaike, and Edem Offiong to compete in the singles’ event in Tokyo.  An excited Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of NTTF, Ishaku Tikon said he has been proved right with the confirmation by ITTF as the exploits of Aruna in the last two years were enough to secure a place for him in Tokyo.
