Former Ondo Governor Dr. Olusegun Mimiko has denied rumour that he planned defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC). Mimiko said playing partisan politics was the least of his concerns at the moment. Mimiko, who spoke in a statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media, John Paul Akinduro, said he remained in the Zenith Labour Party(ZLP). He said he was more concerned on how to pull the nation back from the brinks and not rumoured defection into another party. The former Governor noted he yearned for a collaboration of left leaning political groups to offer a real ideologically driven alternative in the nation’s political process. Describing his supposed plan to defect to the APC as “a piece of fake news,”, Mimiko stated that he was in Abuja last one week to attend some events, including the meeting of some NGOs with ethnic-nationality leaders who showed concerned about the deepening insecurity in the land. According to him: “It is noteworthy that at Hon Akinlaja’s book presentation, Dr Mimiko harped on the theme of security, by advising the President on the centrality of the security challenge to his legacy. He also had many informal meetings with Nigerians across ethnic, religious and political divide, on the need to find lasting, just and fair solutions to the orgy of violence and bloodletting across the country. “No where was any mention made or discussion held on any possible defection to any party. Dr. Mimiko remains in the Zenith Labour Party.”
