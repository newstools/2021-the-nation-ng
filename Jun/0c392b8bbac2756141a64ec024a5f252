The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has said it is probing 1,000 corps members who attempted to compromise its workers on posting and redeployment. The scheme, which explained that the accounts of corps members had been temporarily blocked, threatened to sanction anybody involved in the act, after its investigation. Director General of the NYSC, Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, said this yesterday while addressing reporters in Abuja after declaring open the 2020 inspectors development programme, with the theme: Optimising the Ideals of the Scheme Through Effective Utilisation of the NYSC Inspector. The NYSC had suspended the accounts of some corps members in the 2021 Batch A, Streams 1 and 2, form allegedly seeking redeployment from the original states they were posted to. While some of the affected corps members were said to have sought redeployment from some states, especially in the North because of insecurity, a few others were said to have sought redeployment on health grounds, among others. Besides cancelling the redeployment, the NYSC reportedly suspended their accounts and stopped their monthly allowance. Ibrahim said the affected corps members were still under investigation while those found guilt would face disciplinary action. He said: “There are 1,000 corps members nationwide we believe were involved in unethical practices. So, we cancelled their deployment. We are still investigating it. So, anybody involved will be disciplined accordingly.”
