Senator Ifeanyi Ubah might be confident of defeating APGA, PDP, and APC at the Anambra state governorship election but that’s not all he has his eyes on. The billionaire politician is also looking at making a grand entry into the Lagos political scene. The Capital Oil boss has thrown his political and financial weight behind young and vibrant Lagos politician, Omotayo Abayomi. According to sources, Ubah has identified with Omotayo, who is vying for a political office in the Ifako Ijaiye area of Lagos under the Young Progressives Party (YPP). It was further revealed that Ubah had been meeting with Omotayo after he won the primaries to contest for the seat of the councilor representing Ward B of the Ifako Ijaiye Local Government. Omotayo is  a certified synthetic turf entrepreneur and Microsoft excel expert.
