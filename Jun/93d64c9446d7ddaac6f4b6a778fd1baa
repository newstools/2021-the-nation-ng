Oyo State government has debunked a media report which alleged it has sacked some protesting staff of the state-owned The Oke Ogun Polytechnic, Saki (TOPS) on Tuesday. The State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mr. Olasunkanmi Olaleye, while making the clarification said it is imperative in views of a “misinformation that the state government sacked 184 workers from the state-owned Polytechnic for allegedly protesting against poor salary and working conditions.” According to him, those whose appointments were reviewed were part-time staff, whose recruitment process was being reformed. He assured that the affected persons would be re-engaged under a clearer condition of service that will ensure that they are paid per credit hours of teaching. The commissioner noted that the disengagement letter had clearly indicated that the part-time workers could re-apply under the new procedures. Olaleye said; “It is mischievous for some opposition voices to launch out and claim that the state government, which has been busy clearing the rot left behind by the APC government in education and other sectors, would just terminate the appointment of 184 persons for the fun of it. “Those disengaged by the state-owned Polytechnics are not full-time workers but part-time workers. And it should also be made clear that they will be re-engaged under a clear condition of service that will ensure payment per credit hours of teaching.”
