A Niger Delta ex-militant leader, General Adu Solo has urged the federal government to constitute the substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), emphasizing that it will be in its “best interest”. He made the call while addressing aggrieved youths in his hometown in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State. The ex-militant while expressing anger over the delay of constituting the board said it is hindering the developmental growth of the region. Calling on the Minister, Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio to act swiftly, he claimed the “tactics” been employed to administer the agency “is to deter development in the Niger Delta Region. “However we will continue to engage the presidency to make sure the board is constituted. “To avoid another phase of hostilities, it is in the best interest of the Presidency to at this point in time, heed the calls of patriotic Niger Deltans.” He added that the current leadership of the NDDC will encourage looting, hence the need to immediately constitute the board. Urgent calls for the immediate inauguration of the NDDC board by stakeholders of the region climaxed with an ultimatum issued by ex-militant leader Chief Government Ekpemupolo (alias Tompolo). This prompted a visit by the minister to the region, where he assured that the constitution of the board will be “fast-tracked.” Stakeholders are expectant that the NDDC board will be sworn in, on or before the end of this June.
