Former Super Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh has said he is open to offers from clubs in Belgium, where he started his career in Europe and where he still lives with his family. “I would like to start working in Belgium, because together with my family we have a very good time here,” he told Voetbalnieuws. “It’s important to me that I can come home after the match and that my family is there. I don’t feel like going abroad and leaving them behind. “There are offers from abroad, but I want to work close to where I live. In the past I was close to an agreement with Waasland-Beveren, but that fell through. “First Division B? I have already proved in the past that I do not shy away from that, because I was already working at Fortuna Sittard.” The former Super Eagles captain has previously worked as technical director at Eupen and as trainer of another Belgian club, Wezet. Oliseh sensationally resigned as Super Eagles coach in 2016.
