Nigeria’s premier and largest non-interest financial services company, Jaiz Bank Plc provides a window into assessing the viability and profitability of alternative finance. Through the odds, financial reports show steady growth in incomes and profit as well as market share. Deputy Group Business Editor, Taofik Salako, highlights the underlying performance indicators and outlook for the bank Shareholders of Jaiz Bank Plc will meet this week to consider and approve distribution of more than N833 million as cash dividends for the 2020 business year.

Management outlook Managing Director, Jaiz Bank Plc, Mr. Hassan Usman said the vision of the bank is to become the leading non-interest financial institution in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). According to him, the results of the bank have consistently shown stable growth trajectory as the bank continues to expand and deploys innovative technology to bring alternative financing closer to the people. He said the bank’s growth strategy focuses on the real sector of the economy, especially the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and financial inclusion. He added that the bank would continue to expand its operations across the country by opening more branches while significantly leveraging on technology to reach its target markets across the nation and bring the underbanked and unbanked population into the formal economy. Usman said the bank’s growth strategy of focussing on the real sector, though painstaking, will ensure sustainable growth and better returns over the years. According to him, Jaiz Bank wants to develop small and medium enterprises (SMEs), grow with them and support them not only for profit making but to ensure the country achieves real growth. “We shall continue to internally develop new customers, new markets and new product for both our physical and virtual channels. We remain committed to continuous up-scaling of our governance mechanism to meet the highest operating standards. Cost efficiency is at the heart of our value creation model. We shall strive to be a low cost operator,” Usman said. Jaiz Bank recently deployed the new Quick Response Code (NQR) to ease transactions for its customers and merchants. NQR Code is an indigenous payment platform designed by the Nigeria Interbank Settlement Scheme (NIBSS) to provide a reliable and enhanced payment experience to low transaction costs for customers. NQR is a flexible digital and contactless payment solution that is convenient with an integrated process that leverages on Application Programming Interface (APIs). It enhances the scanning to pay mode, fast-track the process for receiving money in real-time, and facilitates quick payments. The NQR platform is integrated with the Jai Bank’s existing mobile banking application to support retail payment and cardless ATM withdrawal.  Besides, the payment system only requires customers to log into the app, scan the NQR code, authenticate the transaction with a PIN and merchants are instantly credited with the value. Usman described the NQR Code as one of the most innovative and exciting products of the payment systems in Nigeria. According to him, the deployment of NQR by the bank is in line with its strategy of growing its retail business, deepening digital financial inclusion, and lowering transaction cost for its customers. Jaiz Bank was created out of the former Jaiz International Plc, which was set up in 2003 as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to establish Nigeria’s first full-fledged non-interest bank. The bank is owned by more than 27,000 shareholders, including the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). It obtained a regional licence to operate as a non-interest bank from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on November 11, 2011and began full operations as the first non-interest bank in Nigeria on January 6, 2012. In 2016, it obtained the national banking license from the CBN and started to rapidly spread its network across the country. Jaiz Bank recorded another milestone on February 9, 2017 as the first non-interest financial institution to be listed on the stock exchange with the admission of the entire issued share capital of the bank to the main board of the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited. For alternative finance, ethical and corporate governance compliance is a key parameter. A review of the regulatory reports at the NGX showed that Jaiz Bank has not compromised any of the post-listing requirements.This may explain the liquidity and continuous trading on the shares of the bank, a secondary return for investors.
