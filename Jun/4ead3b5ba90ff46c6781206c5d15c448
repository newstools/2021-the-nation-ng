The Plateau State Chapter of the People’s Democratic Party,( PDP), has raised the alarm over a plan by the state’s Independent Electoral Commission to ban the party from participating in the October 9th, local government election. The Secretary of the Plateau state PDP Caretaker committee, Hon. Patrick Ogbu who raised the alarm while speaking to reporters in Jos expressed disgust over the move to ban the party over alleged unsubstantiated reasons. Ogbu explained that based on the election guidelines and the timetable released by PLASIEC, “our party in line with our extant laws wrote to notify the commission of the party’s activities toward the election patterning to the conduct of Wards and Local Government Congresses/primaries to elect our party candidates in the LG elections. “But to our astonishment, Ogbu said that the commission responded to that notification letter and informed us that they will not supervise our party primaries, citing court judgment against an already dissolved EXCO and a judgment that was already complied with by the national working committee of our party. He further explained that subsequent correspondences between CTC and PLASIEC which included; request for the 2021 LG election guidelines, request for the release of nomination forms for our candidates, request for the audience with the PLASIEC chairman but all these were negative as none was granted by the PLASIEC. “It is crystal clear to us, that from our correspondences with PLASIEC, there is a grand plan by PLASIEC to exclude the PDP from participating in the local government elections.
