After more than five months, Abubakar Garba Idris, a senior Protection Assistant with the United Nation High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), who was abducted by The Islamic State of West African Province(ISWAP) on Maiduguri/Damaturu highway, has regained freedom. Authentic humanitarian sources informed The Nation Idris, who is popularly known as Alooma, is undergoing medical and military check with troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Maiduguri before he is reunited with his family. The source also revealed that a businessman, Muazu Bawa, who was also kidnapped on that same day was also released along eight other captives all undergoing debriefing by the military. The Nation recalled the insurgents attacked a convoy of travellers close to Matari village between Mainok to Jakana along Maiduguri/Damaturu highway where Alooma was abducted at about 8.30 am Saturday, January 2, 2021.
