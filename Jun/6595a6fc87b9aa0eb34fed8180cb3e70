Governors elected under the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) are set to commence process for implementation of autonomy of the judiciary and state legislature as agreed by the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) Committee and other stakeholders. This decision was reached at an emergency meeting of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), the umbrella body of APC Governors in Abuja, after reviewing and adopting the recommendations of the Gov Aminu Tambuwal- led NGF Committee. A statement by chairman of the Forum, Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi on Friday in Abuja, explained consultations are to commence by Attorneys-General of APC- controlled States with a view to providing necessary legal framework for the implementation of the policy. Badugu noted the Tambuwal-led NGF Committee consulted all the critical stakeholders, notably leadership of State Judiciary and Assemblies. He declared the Committee jointly reached agreements on specific initiatives to be taken by State Governments to guarantee autonomy for State judiciary and assemblies. In the light of this, Bagudu said the meeting “endorsed agreements reached by the Governor Tambuwal-led NGF Committee and enjoined all APC controlled states and indeed all states to commence the process of implementing the submitted recommendations. “As part of the process of implementing the NGF agreements in APC controlled states, “appropriate consultations with Attorneys-General will take place in order to provide all necessary legal framework for the implementation of the Governor Tambuwal-led NGF Committee’s proposed recommendations.”
