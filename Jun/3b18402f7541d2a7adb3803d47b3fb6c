GERMANY head coach Joachim Loew is under pressure to shake up his starting side for Tuesday’s blockbuster Euro 2020 last 16 clash against England at Wembley and drop under-performing winger Leroy Sane. As a replacement for Thomas Mueller, who was sidelined by a knee injury, Sane struggled on his first start of the tournament in the 2-2 draw against Hungary, with Germany needing a late equaliser to reach the knockout stages. Sane made little impact up front, reflecting an inconsistent first season for Bayern Munich where the flashes of brilliance were all too few and far between. When Sane failed to convert a chance from a corner against Hungary, whistles echoed around Munich’s Allianz Arena on Wednesday. Former Germany midfielder Stefan Effenberg says Loew must react by dropping the 25-year-old for the England showdown. “Loew shouldn’t start Sane, he is not doing the team any favours, but neither is Sane himself,” Effenberg told t-online. “He (Sane) lacks self-confidence – and that means that he can’t use his fantastic abilities.” Both Effenberg and Germany legend Lothar Matthaeus urge Loew to reconsider his midfield options and turn to players from Bundesliga powerhouse Bayern Munich. “Jogi (Loew) trusts the wrong players. Above all, it was the Bayern players who pushed us through,” said Matthaeus.
