A new security outfit deployed in Anambra to crush cultists and other criminals has allegedly killed six suspects. The unnamed outfit arrived in Awka, the state capital, on Saturday, and is likened in style to Bakassi Boys, an unorthodox group known for jungle justice in the state over two decades ago. The first six victims were burnt on Monday. No one seems to know who sent them or how they are to approach their duty, but they are not policemen. Police spokesman Ikenga Tochukwu said he had no information on them, but a senior officer confirmed that they arrived on Saturday. The officer provided no further information. “That’s the only thing I can tell you for now, let’s see how things work out in days and weeks to come,” he said. “If they engage in jungle justice, nobody will talk, especially the lawyers and human rights groups, but when police engage in such, the whole world will tumble and that’s what the state deserves at this moment, ” the source said. Awka has been terrorised by cultists without much resistance from police.
