The South East Governors’ forum has urged security agencies to immediately arrest those responsible for the murder of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak, an APC Chieftain. This is contained in a statement issued by the Chairman of the forum and Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi on Tuesday after a virtual meeting on the security situation in the zone.
The forum described the murder of Gulak, in Owerri, Imo, as a national catastrophe. “It is with a rude shock that we received the news of the unfortunate death of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak in the hands of the senseless gunmen. ”We, on behalf of the people of South East, condemn the act highly and we charge security agencies to immediately deploy their officers and men to arrest the perpetrators and make them face justice, we, however, pray to God to grant the deceased rest in eternity”. The governors condoled the Gulak’s family, the Adamawa Government and Nigerians in general. “We assure our fellow northern governors of our commitment to unravel all masterminds of the act. “The forum urges the public to exercise restraint and allow security agencies continue with their investigations while assuring that all those involved in the act will be brought to justice,” the forum said.
