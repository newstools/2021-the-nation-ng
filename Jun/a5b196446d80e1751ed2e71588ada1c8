The Federal Government on Tuesday presented the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu before Federal High Court in Abuja. Lawyer to the FG, S. M. Labaran, said Kanu was arrested through intelligence and collaborative efforts of security agencies. Labaran was silent on where and how Kanu was arrested. Following Labaran’s ex-parte application, Justice Binta Nyako ordered that Kanu, who was brought to court in handcuffs and hooded before the court’s sitting, be remanded in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS).
