A support group of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Legacy Awareness Campaign (APC-LAC) has challenged the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to present its achievements during its 16- year reign. The group alleged the 16-year rule of the opposition party was destructive, insisting that PDP has nothing to show for the years it was in government. The group, in a statement to highlight achievements of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration in Abuja on Wednesday, said, unlike the PDP, the APC government has succeeded in laying a solid foundation for the country in the last six years. The statement titled: “APC is laying the foundation for the greatness of Nigeria” was signed by Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi and Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman. While admitting that criticisms and opposition are essential in a democracy, the group stressed Nigerians are not short of memory of how destructive the PDP were as managers of Nigeria, insisting that APC is working to rebuild the country after years of neglect and destructions by laying the solid and sustainable foundation for the country’s greatness. The group maintained that Buhari’s administration has developed more infrastructure in the last six years than the entire sixteen years of PDP’s administration.
