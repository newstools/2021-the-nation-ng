Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has boasted that with his performance in office nobody will talk about the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. The governor spoke in Port Harcourt on Tuesday during commissioning of the construction of the Ogbum-nu-Abali/Eastern-Bypass Road project. Wike accused the previous administration of politicising the reconstruction of the road and failing to carry out the project. The governor said he looked beyond such politicking by interfacing with the people to understand the economic benefits of a dualised road in the city centre. He said with the level of infrastructural development around Ogbum-nu-Abali, there would be a spike in the value of property in the area. He said: “I know that the people of Ogbum-nu-Abali resisted the dualisation of this road because of lack of information. When I met with the community leaders, they said look, they have houses bequeathed to them by their grandparents. “I told them that whether they like it or not, if I don’t dualise it today, tomorrow somebody else will do it. And you don’t know who is coming. “So, it’s better done now that I am a governor than when you don’t know who is coming. And the economic benefit of this road is too much, which you may not understand now.” The governor stated that the entire Old Government Residential Area (GRA) had been given a facelift with quality road projects. He said: “This is the only place remaining. Old GRA cannot be like that and then we will leave this place. We have done the Rebisi flyover, the Oru-Abali flyover. There is no way this place will not be dualised at all. It’s not possible.”
