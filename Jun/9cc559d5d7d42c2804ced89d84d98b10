Thousands of stakeholders of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Awka South Local Government Area of Anambra state have passed vote of confidence on the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Victor Oye. The stakeholders, who met in Awka at the instance of the Majority Leader and member representing Awka South One Constituency in the House of Assembly, Dr. Nnamdi Okafor, also threw their weight behind Prof. Chukwuma Soludo as their candidate. In a communique by the party stalwarts in the area, the chieftains warned they would no longer tolerate those they described as ‘political wonderers’ bent on destabilizing the party, insisting they were solidly behind the Oye leadership. The communique partly reads: “The APGA stakeholders in Awka South Local Government Area are solidly behind the leadership of Dr. Victor Oye as the indisputable national chairman of APGA. “We vehemently reject in totality the political wonderers who claim to have an acting National Chairman of APGA in the name of Jude Okeke. We can no longer tolerate those who were bent on destabilizing the party. “The party’s constitution stipulates that the national Chairman of APGA can only be removed from office through a national convention but some imposters within the party did not do so in suspending Dr. Oye. “We are supporting Prof. Chukwuma Soludo as their candidate for the party’s governorship primaries that will hold on the 23th of June, 2021 in the state.” On his part, Transition Committee Chairman, Awka South Local Government Area, Mr. Leo Nwuba described Oye’s leadership as second to none as the party had witnessed tremendous change under his watch. Some of the stakeholders who signed the communique included Dr. Nnamdi Okafor, member representing Awka South Two Constituency, Hon. Chukwuma Okoye, Mr Leo Nwuba, Managing Director, Anambra Oxygen plant, Dr. Onyeka Ibezim, Dr. Simeon Onyemaechi, among others.
