Moses Simon has expressed his delight in returning to the Super Eagles fold for the team’s double header friendly against Cameroon in Austria. The Nantes winger had missed Nigeria’s 2020 African Cup of Nations qualifiers against the Benin Republic and Lesotho in March as his club would not release the 25-year-old due to COVID-19 travel restrictions imposed in France at that time. The former Levante star was replaced by Genk’s Paul Onuachu and the Belgium-based striker was brilliant, scoring two goals in both games despite coming in as a substitute. Simon posted impressive performances to help Nantes avoid relegation which earned him the Player of the Month award for May by EaglesTrackers.com, a website that monitors Nigerian players plying their trade abroad. “For me it is good, they welcomed me well, I thank my teammates for the welcome,” Simon said when asked how he feels re-joining the team. Simon admitted that the game with the Indomitable Lions would not be an easy game but believes Gernot Rohr’s side are suitably prepare for the clash, which would serve as an opportunity for the German tactician to assess new players ahead of the Liberia and Cape Verde World Cup qualifying games later in the year. “Of course we know Cameroon is not an easy team,” Simon said. “We have beaten them I think three or four times in a row so I know they will be well prepared but I believe we will be ready for them,” he added.
