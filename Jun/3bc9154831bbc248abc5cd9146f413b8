Former Secretary General of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Anthony Sani, has said those calling for the restructuring of the polity are naïve. He said any far-reaching restructuring of the country should pass through constitutional amendment. Sani, who supported President Muhammadu Buhari’s comment on restructuring, said advocates of the arrangement should take advantage of the current constitution review by the National Assembly to make their case. Speaking with The Nation, he said: “…Any far-reaching reforms of this country have to be undertaken through constitutional amendments, which is ongoing. “Such advocates are at liberty to take advantage of the public hearings and make submissions for effect. This is necessary, considering that the term ‘restructuring’ means different things to different groups and individuals. “To some groups, it is true federalism; whatever that means. To some others, it is fiscal federalism. There are other groups who see it as resource control or resource ownership. Yet, we have those who define restructuring as the return to the 1963 Constitution, while others see it as the introduction of state police. “Given the place of multiparty democracy, which allows individual political parties to represent distinct methods of solution, as contained in their manifestos used for canvassing electoral mandate needed for implementation, one would not be wrong to submit that the President merely reechoed the view that there are only two ways of making restructuring to come unto its own. “These are through the Legislature, which comprises representatives of Nigerians whose place in the order of our democracy is to make laws that can accommodate restructuring; and the political parties, which are at liberty to include their preferred version of the restructuring in their manifestos that would enable Nigerians make informed judgments during voting.”
