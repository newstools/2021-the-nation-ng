Ten days after the Salihu Tanko Islamic School children in Tegina were abducted, the Niger State government yesterday said it is doing everything possible to secure their release. The Tegina Islamiyya School children were abducted from their Islamic school in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State. The Deputy Governor, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Ketso disclosed this in a chat with reporters in Minna, the Niger State capital. Replying to criticism that has trailed the government’s silence over securing the release of the students, Ketso explained that everything is kept under wraps for security reasons. “The government cannot just sit down and feel apathy for the parents. Any responsible government cannot do that. “We are doing everything possible for their release,” he said. The Secretary to the Niger State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane further explained that there are certain issues about security that cannot be said in the public. He urged the people to believe in the government that the children will return safely. “We know it can get emotional and touchy. There are certain things the government cannot say about security. The government is doing whatever it is doing assiduously to deal with the security situation in the state.
