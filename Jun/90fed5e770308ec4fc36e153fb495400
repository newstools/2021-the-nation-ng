Charles Oputa aka Charlyboy has explained why he apologised to his lesbian daughter, Dewy Oputa after she accused him of neglect. Dewy had called out her father on Instagram when he revealed how he felt about her sexuality. Charly Boy had stressed that he is in support of his daughter, irrespective of her choice of sexuality. However, Dewy who didn’t seem pleased with her father’s statement accused him of being a ‘hypocrite’. Speaking in an interview, Charly Boy said he apologised to his daughter because he realised he was encroaching into her private life. “I apologised because I had the same clash with my father who was trying to doctor my life. ‘’I resisted and said no, I will tell my own story.” ‘His Royal Punkness’ continued: ”I did not realise I was encroaching. ‘’Even though initially when I heard; like any other parent; I was concerned but then I cannot be hypocritical because I have fought for LGBT rights and some many rights. So because of my daughter, I can’t change.” The ‘Area Fada’ further noted that he had to apologise to his daughter because the bond between them was beyond that of a typical father and daughter but that of close friends. He said: ”When I realised that, I apologised to her because we are friends. ‘’It is not a father-daughter relationship, we are the buddy and that is the special bond I share with all my children.”
