Christian Eriksen has reassured fans that he “feels okay” as he sent a new public message from his hospital bed in Copenhagen. Eriksen is currently recovering and undergoing further tests in Rigshospitalet after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first half of Denmark’s Euro 2020 Group B opener against Finland at Parken Stadium on Saturday evening. In an update posted to his official Instagram account on Tuesday morning, Eriksen, alongside a picture of himself smiling and giving the thumbs up, said: “Hello everyone, big thanks for your sweet and amazing greetings and messages from around the world. It means a lot to me and my family. “I’m fine – under the circumstances. I still have to go through some examinations at the hospital, but I feel okay.” In the message that was also relayed by the Danish FA on Twitter, Eriksen added: “Now I will cheer on the boys on the Denmark team in the next matches. Play for all of Denmark. Best, Christian.” Eriksen collapsed in distressing scenes shortly before half-time of Saturday’s match and received prolonged treatment from medics, who administered CPR, before being transferred to Rigshospitalet.
