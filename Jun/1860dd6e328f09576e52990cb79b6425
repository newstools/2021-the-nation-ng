The passage followed the consideration of the report of the Senate Committee on FCT, which handled the Appropriation Bill, 2021.  Committee Chairman Abubakar Kyari said from the total expenditure of N329,963,491,523.00, the sum of N74,323,382,813 is for Personnel Costs; N58,728,614,466 is for Overheads; and N196,911,494,243 for Capital Expenditure.

The legislation, titled: “A Bill for an Act to provide for a comprehensive legal and institutional framework for the recovery and management of proceeds of crime or benefits derived from unlawful activities, harmonize and consolidate the legal provisions on the recovery of proceeds of crime and related matters, 2021” was sponsored by Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North). In his lead debate, Abdullahi noted that the country had been striving to put in place an appropriate Proceeds of Crime legislation since 2007.
