Sergio Ramos was understandably in an emotional mood as he bid farewell to Real Madrid during a press conference on Thursday. The 35-year-old, who has spent the last 16 years at the club and became captain, used words to the effect of Zinedine Zidane when the coach left Los Blancos at the end of his first spell in charge, stating that it is a ‘see you later’ rather than a ‘goodbye’. “The moment has come, one of the most difficult in my life; the time has come to say goodbye to Real Madrid. I arrived hand in hand with my father…,” is all Ramos could say before bursting into tears. “It’s impossible not to get emotional. I would have liked to say goodbye in our stadium, at the [Estadio] Santiago Bernabeu. “Thank you, Real Madrid. I will always carry you in my heart. It’s the end of a wonderful, unique period in my life, and the beginning of a period of hope and future with a great desire to show my best for many years to come and to be able to add another trophy to my list of honours. “Thank you very much to everyone. This is more than a goodbye; it’s a see you later, because I’ll be back.”
