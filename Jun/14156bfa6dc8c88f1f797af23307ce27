The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) on Tuesday said telecommunication companies recorded a fall in subscribers base to the tune of over three million in the month in April According to the latest industry statistics released by the commission,  the subscriber base fell from 192,413,613 in March to 188,705,734 in April. Globacom recorded the highest figures for the month of April with a drop of about two million subscribers, MTN lost about a million while both Airtel and 9mobile lost less than 500,000 subscribers. MTN’s subscribers dropped from 75,927,231 in March to 74,819,864 in April. Globacom dropped from 52,918,718 in March to 50,598,855 in April. 9mobile dropped from 12,850,383 in March to 12,779,155 in April. Airtel dropped from 50,384,950 in March to 50,177,408 in April. The statistics also showed that broadband penetration dropped from 41.18 per cent in March to 40.66 per cent in April. This was attributed to the  loss of more than one million data subscribers by telecom companies in the month of April. The report indicated that no porting services were recorded for the month as has been the case since January. In December 2020, the sale and registration of new SIM cards was banned by the Federal Government and a December 30 deadline for people to link their National Identity Number with their SIM cards was set. This has since been moved to June 30 with a record of over 56 million Nigerians captured by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC).
