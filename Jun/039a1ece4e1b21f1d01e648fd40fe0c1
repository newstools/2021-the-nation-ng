Cameroon’s  Portuguese  coach Antonio Conceicao has lauded the indomitable Lions for showing the right mentality needed to record a historic victory over the Super Eagles. The Indomitable Lions secured a narrow 1-0 win over Nigeria in an international friendly match in Vienna on Friday thanks to Zambo Anguissa’s 37th -minute winning strike. It was Cameroon’s first triumph over the Super Eagles since their penalty shootout victory over their arch-rivals in the final of the African Cup of Nations in 2000 after full-time scores stood at 2-2. Nigeria won five of the six subsequent matches, including a thrilling 3-2 win at the quarterfinals of the AFCON hosted by Egypt two years ago. Cameroon will host the next edition of the continental showpiece and know they may have to overcome a few traditional favourites, including Nigeria, to lift the prestigious trophy on home soil. “This victory facilitates our work,” the head coach told Camfoot. “That is to say that we are on a good path. It is always much easier to work on victories than on more negative results. “It will go down in history, but the most important thing is to see the behaviour of my players both individually and collectively. “We took notes; we saw positive things. Logically we need time to improve. We are not yet perfect, but I am very satisfied with the attitude and professionalism of my players.” Cameroon and Nigeria face off again tomorrow  as both teams complete the second leg of their double-header friendly clash.
