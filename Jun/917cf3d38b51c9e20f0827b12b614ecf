Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo has said he is more motivated than ever to lead his country to back-to-back European Championship titles. Portugal won the tournament in 2016 and begin their title defence on Tuesday against Hungary, in Budapest, in their Group F opener. “I feel as motivated or even more than in 2004 when I played my first European tournament,” Ronaldo told Canal 11. “We are the defending champions, and we are part of a new group of candidates to win the trophy.” Portugal have one of the most talented teams in the tournament with the likes of Ronaldo, Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes and Manchester City’s Ruben Dias, who was voted as the Premier League’s best player of the season, among their ranks. “The Portuguese can expect the same as always, a national team with a lot of enthusiasm and ambition,” Ronaldo said.
