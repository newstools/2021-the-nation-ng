Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele, has advocated for a combined public-private work that will prevent future health crises from spilling over to the nation’s economy. He spoke during a documentary premiere on leadership, trust, and the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, held at the Performing Art Theatre Hall of the new campus of the Bayero University, Kano. The documentary, called ‘Unmasked’, was co-produced and directed by Femi Odugbemi, and presented by Kadaria Ahmed. While requesting useful information on healthcare to the general public, Mr. Emefiele also called for intensive research and development in the health sector. The CBN governor, in a keynote address he transmitted, disclosed that the “CBN notes a strong link between healthcare and economic growth,” as evidenced by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nigeria and the world. Emefiele said: “In order to prevent future health crises that could have spillover effects on our economy, it is important that the public and private sector work to improve access to healthcare, support research and development in the health sector and find ways to disseminate useful information on healthcare to the general public. “On our part, the CBN remains committed to working with all stakeholders in improving access to finance and credit that would support the development of a viable healthcare infrastructure in our country.”
