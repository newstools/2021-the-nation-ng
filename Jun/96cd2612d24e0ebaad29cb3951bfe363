Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has disowned presidential campaign posters pairing him with a former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Charles Soludo as his running mate. The posters, which surfaced in Abuja on Monday, had Atiku and Soludo’s photographs side by side announcing an Atiku/Soludo ticket for the 2023 presidential election. In a statement released by his media office and signed by his media aide, Paul Ibe, Atiku said he knew nothing about the posters or those who may have promoted it. The former Vice President pointed out that while he is still a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Soludo is presently an aspirant for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra state, on the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). The statement said: “Ordinarily, we would have ignored the reports, but for the interest of those who may be misled by the disingenuous plot. “It is obvious that this is a work of mischief. For the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar is of the PDP while Charles Soludo is of APGA. It is silly of anyone to attempt to drag the former Vice President into an election in Anambra which outcome will be determined by the people of the state. “Atiku Abubakar is presently preoccupied with joining hands with other well-meaning Nigerians to help in finding solutions to the myriad of challenges plaguing our nation such as insecurity and economic downturn marked by joblessness and extreme poverty. “That explains why last Monday, the Waziri of Adamawa commissioned the headquarters of Standard Micro Finance Bank and two manufacturing plants, promoted by him in Yola to provide much-needed jobs and opportunities. “We wish to restate that the purported 2023 campaign posters in circulation linking Atiku to Soludo, is the handiwork of mischief makers and should be ignored.”
