Nollywood star Mercy Johnson-Okojie has surprised fans with a new hairstyle. The versatile actress, who is known for sharing videos of amazing family moments on her social media, unveiled her new full blonde low haircut. Mercy Johnson had in the past adorned a couple of bold looks for her various movie roles. This time, the new haircut seems to have been born out of a personal decision to rock a totally different look. The actress, who is shooting the second season of her cooking show, “Mercy’s Menu”, showed off in an Instagram post where she rocked a nicely sown ankara dress and crowned it with the blonde haircut as she also displayed a beautiful smile to seal up her new look. The mother of four captioned the photo:“ My new hair cut.”
