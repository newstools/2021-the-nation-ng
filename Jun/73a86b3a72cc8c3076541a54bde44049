Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has called on journalists not to fan the embers of discord owing to the security challenges facing the country. Akeredolu urged journalists to uphold the truth and promote positive values which he noted are essential for nation building. Akeredolu who spoke in Akure after he was presented with the ‘Man of The Decade Award’ tasked the Nigeria media to set the agenda for the nation through robust professionalism without fanning the embers of discord and disunity in the polity. The Ondo Governor said it was important for the Fourth Estate to be fearless and be a credible watchdog that must abhor sensationalism and yellow journalism. He said, “No matter the economic and environmental challenges, the Journalist must remain unbending and unyielding in his crusade for a sane society. All of these require strict adherence to ethical standards for which the truth remains sacred while comments must be identified in its true state as opinion. “Nobody can explain the killings in Owerri. The challenge is heightened the more. Journalist must support good ideas. Journalists have great task. How do we continue with this senseless killing and kidnappings? We are in trouble in Nigeria. There must be a collective engagement. Everybody is involved “The press has a duty to uphold the truth. The press holds the highest responsibility of setting agenda for the Nation today. Journalists have to set the tone. This country is resolute to be together.”
