The Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, has attributed the unpleasant circumstances surrounding exits of his predecessors to ‘corruption fighting back’. Bawa stated this on Thursday while speaking during the weekly Ministerial Briefing organized by the Presidential Media Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Asked if he was not concerned how his predecessors were removed from office, the EFCC boss said there are reasons why occupiers of the office will be considered as enemies by persons whom they had denied the enjoyment of an illegally acquired wealth. According to him, such persons who had been stopped and made to relinquish illicitly acquired assets always go out to embarrass and get their pound of flesh from the official deemed to have been their nemesis. He also disclosed that some persons had already started a move to tarnish his image, moving round and securing services of media outlets to execute the plot against him.
