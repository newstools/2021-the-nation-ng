After losing their group opener to host Lithuania on Tuesday, Nigeria yesterday bounced back with a convincing 3-0 win over Kosovo in Group C at the Billie Jean King Cup by BNP Paribas Europe/Africa Group III taking place at the SEB Arena in Vilnius, Lithuania. The opening tie against Lithuania saw Nigeria’s trio of Oyinlomo Quadre, Sarah Adegoke, and Adesuwa Osabuohien giving their opponents a good fight. According to the organisers, hosts, Lithuania might have overcome Nigeria 3-0, but the tie was harder than the scoreline suggests as Lithuanian No. 2 singles player Iveta Dapkute had to come back from a set down to defeat Osabuohien 4-6 6-2 6-4 and the doubles match was a narrow 6-4 7-5 win for the hosts. But yesterday, the Nigerian ladies put the defeat to Lithuania behind them to show their worth against Kosovo. It was Osabuohien that started the onslaught against Kosovo’s Donika Bashota and comprehensively gave Nigeria a 1-0 lead after winning the match at 6-1, 6-4. In the second match, Quadre was stretched by Adrijana Lekaj that after winning the first set 6-2 easily, she was forced to fight back following the second set 6-4 win by her Kosovo opponent. To affirm her superiority in the match, Quadre wasted no time in dismissing her opponent in the third set with a 6-0 win to give Nigeria a 2-0 lead. In less than an hour, the pair of Osabuohie and Quadre completed the rout against Kosovo after beating the duo of Lekaj and Bashota 6-2, 6-1 to hand Nigeria its first group win of the tournament. Regardless of the outcome between Lithuania and Kosovo, Nigeria has missed out from the promotion play-off while they will now be aiming to finish in a good position to prevent their drop to Group IV next year. Winners from each group are expected to contest a play-off draw to determine the two teams that will be promoted to Group II next year while the bottom teams will drop to Group IV.
