Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has said he refused to stay in the multi-billionaire naira governor’s lodge built by former Governor Olusegun Mimiko because it had structural defect. Akeredolu said the former governor’s lodge built by the colonial officers and used by late Dr. Olusegun Agagu was termites infected. Akeredolu who spoke in Akure at the ground breaking of the building of a new Governor’s lodge said Mimiko did not fix the defect before leaving office. The Ondo Governor said it was a wrong assertion that the Mimiko’s administration built a Governor lodge. He said former Governor Mimiko converted an office into a lodge adding that it had structural defect that it would take a super man to live in. According to him, “This state deserve a Governor lodge to be a pride to all of us. When Mimiko was handing over, he mentioned the defects and promised to fix it but he didn’t. “I called my engineer to look at it and I was told to either bring down the building or part of it. Then we all knew we are going to need a new Governor lodge. “What we had was a modest three room duplex built by the colonial officers. It was termites infested. It was not suited for anybody to live. My consultant said I should not attempt to remodel it. “Those who want to build for us today are qualified building experts. We are building a government lodge of a status befitting of the Governor of Ondo State.” Akeredolu ordered the contractor to build an helipad saying that new lodge would be fitted with a swimming pool, outdoor kitchen, bedrooms and a good banquet hall. The contractor, Architect Olufemi Bello, said the old building was inspected but discovered that it was not worth renovating. He said, “This building is a legacy projects. It is a building intended to stand like the White House. It will be used for over 30 years. The project will last many years.”
