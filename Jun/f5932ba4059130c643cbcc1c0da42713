After failing to meet the qualification time for the relay events of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games during the National Olympics trials at the weekend, Nigeria continues its chase for the tickets at the Lagos Athletics Championships scheduled for Thursday, June 24 at Teslim Balogun Stadium. However, athletics buffs have expressed concern that the slowness of the track may hamper the team’s chances of meeting the qualification time. According to the Chairman of the Lagos State Athletics Association, Dayo Alao, the tournament is aimed to help Nigeria athletes and others to pick their tickets to the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. “Apart from the opportunity to earn some prize monies, this event will also serve as a Tokyo Olympic qualifying event. Luckily we have a large pool of both foreign and home-based athletes available for the competition,” Alao said. Events to compete for include 100m, 400m, long and high jumps, shot put and relays – 4X100m and 4X400m, while there will be an inter-secondary schools relay for boys and girls as well. According to Alao, the top three finishers in each event would mouth-watering prize while 24 states are already in Lagos for the meet. “The LSSAA in this new term has an eclectic mix of seasoned administrators, technically savvy, highly motivated, and committed to delivering on its mandate,” he assured.
