Speaker, Anambra State House of Assembly, Hon. Uche Okafor has expressed worry over indiscriminate erection of structures in areas meant for recreation in the state. Okafor blamed such conversion of recreational facilities to residential buildings to ignorance of concerned persons or organisations to the significance of nature and environment. Speaking during a tree planting exercise by General Site Solutions (GSS) Group, in commemoration of World Environmental Day, themed, “Ecosystem Restoration,” the Speaker warned residents of dangers inherent in such actions. He also underscored the place of periodic tree planting to check erosion menace in the state. He said, “One of our major problems  in the state is recreation. People don’t appreciate nature and the environment. That’s why you see people building houses where recreation centers are supposed to be. “The Obiano-led administration has invested hugely to fight erosion and flooding in the state as well as creating agencies saddled with the responsibility of checking the menace. “We need to keep sensitizing our people in planting trees and creating parks to preserve the environment which is everyone’s business. Sustainability is all about preserving what we have, including periodic planting of trees.” Managing Director, Clear Drainage and Forest Preservation Agency, Mr. Chido Obidiegwu, said the event was an opportunity to reflect on residents’ actions and inactions towards the environment and its consequences. Earlier, Chairman, GSS Group, Arch. Chukwudi Ezenwa, said his firm awarded a N300 million contract for construction of a 2kilometer access road, bridge and drainage from the major highway, as well as internal pathways and perimeter fence round the estate for security.
