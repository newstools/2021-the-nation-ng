Ahead of the kick-off for the 2022 session of the MultiChoice Talent Factory Academy, MultiChoice has announced the call to entry for the film and TV training programme. The call, according to Multichoice, is open to all emerging filmmakers with either some industry experience or a relevant post-school qualification in film. It was further stressed that the application to MTF West Africa is open to only Nigerians and Ghanaians from June 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021. “The MTF Academy is our commitment to the future of our Industry and gives young Nigerians the chance to hone their television and film production skills through a world-class training programme. After two successful years, we are proud to announce a new call-to-entry and look forward to meeting the next generation of filmmakers,” says John Ugbe, CEO of MultiChoice Nigeria. Launched in May 2018, the MTF Academy has so far given 40 students the chance to harness their expertise in film and TV, molding them into skilled industry professionals. The Class of 2020 set a precedent as the first cohort of students to work during a pandemic. As a result, the programme was extended from 12 to 18 months. This additional time allowed the students to graduate with two qualifications as opposed to one.
