The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has unveiled new Polling Units, bringing the total number to 176,846. The feat was achieved after 25 years of futile attempts to expand the Polling Units. INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, said the expansion was carried to guarantee unencumbered access to Polling Units during elections. He disclosed that 749 Polling Units were relocated from private properties, Palaces and worship centres. Details shortly..
