AYINLA, and Lockdown Heat, the joint efforts between Tunde Kelani, Jade Osiberu, Samuel Bigsam Olatunji, and Seun Oloketuyi will premiere today, Sunday, June 13, 2021. Osiberu and Oloketuyi, who serve as producers for Ayinla and Lockdown Heat respectively, confirmed that invited guests will see the films, which were directed by Kelani and Olatunji, respectively. In a phone interview, Oloketuyi said the premiere of Lockdown Heat, which features Efa Iwara, Mary Lazarus, Omowunmi Dada, Bolanle Ninalowo, Mr Macaroni, Ada Ukoh, and Gbenga Adeyinka 1st, is dear to him because it coincides with the one-year anniversary of phase two of the 2020 lockdown in Nigeria. In the same vein, Osiberu announced that the premiere of Ayinla will hold at EbonyLife place on Victoria Island. For Osiberu, the excitement is the unprecedented collaboration between two generations of filmmakers to bridge the gap between generations of audiences. While ‘Ayinla – The Movie’ tells the story of Nigerian musician, Ayinla Omowura, who used Apala music to address issues of the contemporary society – commending and criticizing various governmental and individual acts to gain fame and fortune, ‘Lockdown Heat’ follows the story of two, young, attractive neighbors of opposite sexes who find themselves embroiled in a shotgun romance as a result of the COVID-19 inspired lockdown.
