 The Acting Director, Directorate of Information Communication Technology ICT, Lagos State University (LASU), Dr. Toyin Enikuomehin, has enjoined students of the institution to take advantage of the free security monitoring application- LASU MONITOR APP- to further guarantee their safety in and out of campus. In an interview with CAMPUSLIFE, he  noted  that the application was  free to download, install and use, and readily available on the Google Playstore. He said: “The  benefits of the app include Friend Walk which will allow a friend to track the user’s movement and location realtime. It also has other rich features including Emergnecy Alert icon that can alert the security department or the health centre in case of emergency. Students in distress can also contact the Guidance and Counselling unit from the  app.” The app, which was launched in 2019 by Department of Computer Science in LASU, has been upgraded to meet the needs of students of  the institution and other interested persons. Enikuomehin noted that with the  situation at hand, the app was a must for  students. He said it would also allow parents to monitor their wards whenever the need arises.
