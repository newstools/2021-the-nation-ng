Nollywood actor James Olanrewaju aka Baba Ijesha will be tried for five offences. A statement by the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Moyosore Onigbanjo, said the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) issued legal advice on Tuesday that a prima facie case has been disclosed against Olarenwaju. It was recommended he should be charged under the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.  The statement reads: “James is to be tried under section 135 – indecent treatment of a child- punishable by seven years imprisonment; section 137 – defilement of a child – punishable by life imprisonment; section 261- sexual assault by penetration – punishable by life imprisonment; section 262- attempted sexual assault by penetration – punishable by 14 years imprisonment and section 263 – sexual assault- punishable by three years imprisonment. “While the state would ensure James’ rights as enshrined in the constitution are upheld, the Ministry of Justice would not relent in its efforts at ensuring that whoever sexually abuses any resident of Lagos is speedily brought to book.” Baba Ijesha was charged for alleged sexual molestation of a minor. His case was transferred to the DPP on April 30.
