Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has explained why he was absent at the All Progressives Party (APC) Southwest leaders meeting which took place in Lagos on Sunday. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Yinka Oyebode and obtained by The Nation explained that the governor’s absence at the meeting was a result of a mix up in the invitation sent out for the meeting. Fayemi claimed that the invitation for the meeting which was said to have been sent via Whatsapp by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s aide, Tunde Rahman, never got to him. The statement reads in part, “Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, wholeheartedly supports the stance of the All Progressives Party (APC) Southwest leaders at their meeting that took place in Lagos on Sunday, May 23rd, 2021 despite his absence at the meeting. “Dr. Fayemi’s absence at the meeting was a result of a mix up in the invitation sent out for the meeting. “For clarity, the invitation for the meeting which was said to have been sent via Whatsapp by Mr. Tunde Rahman, an aide to Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu never got to Governor Fayemi. “The absence of an invitation for the Southwest APC leaders meeting prevented the Governor from attending the meeting, as he was not aware. “Governor Fayemi however sent an apology to the meeting through former Ekiti State Governor and Minister of Industries, Trade and Investments, Otunba Niyi Adebayo; as he was already scheduled to attend another engagement at the time he came to learn of the meeting. “Governor Fayemi, as a true democrat and Southwest leader who is committed to the welfare of the people, is however in total support of the decisions reached by the Southwest leaders at the meeting which include an endorsement of the positions earlier adopted by the Southern Governors’ Forum on the ban on open grazing and the need for true federalism, among others,” the statement added.
