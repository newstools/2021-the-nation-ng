CLEEN Foundation in conjunction with the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has taken its case to Hon. Mojisola Alli-Macaulay, a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly and Chairperson, Committee on Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Lagos State House of Assembly. This was as CLEEN also held a Two-day Capacity Building Workshop for Community-based Women-led organisations in Lagos State at the R&A City Hotel, Ikeja. The visit to the Lagos lawmaker was in furtherance of the two organisations’ battle against human trafficking and forced labour. CLEEN, represented by its Assistant Programme Officer, Segun Ayodele, listed some of the challenges of the battle to include funding, with specific reference to Victim of Trafficking Trust Fund; Laws and Policies, with particular reference to enforcement; and Referral Mechanism. The NAPTIP Lagos Zonal Commander, Ganiu Aganran, also listed some of its activities in the state designated as a transit state, even as he apprised the legislator with its activities in the battle. Responding, Mrs Alli-Macaulay appreciated the effort of the two organisations and pledged her support, even as she pointed out that the team’s first port of call should have been the office of the Commissioner for Women Affairs and First Lady of the State. Facilitators at the capacity training included Afegbai Omolere and Hajara Osho-Tunde, who represented the Lagos NAPTIP Zonal Commander.
