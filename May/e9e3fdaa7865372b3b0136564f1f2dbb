THE Lagos State Education Commissioner, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, has announced plans by the Ministry of Education to establish an Education Radio Station solely dedicated to educational content. She spoke yesterday during the 2021 ministerial press briefing to mark the second anniversary of the Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration. Mrs. Adefisayo, who said the state had filed for licensing of the radio station, added: “It would serve as a channel for educational and training content for pupils and teachers. It is a long process because approval has to come from Abuja, but we have started the process and I think we are getting close to approval.” The commissioner also hinted of plans to establish special skill-based schools (mono-academies) that would appeal to specific interests of learners; and the establishment of six mathematics laboratories in each of the six education districts. Special Adviser to the governor on education Adetokunbo Wahab, who also gave an account of his office in the last year, said the state plans to convert its colleges of education and polytechnic to universities. He said: “In the past few months we have had discussions on the future of our colleges of education. At the EXCO level, we have resolved to upgrade our colleges of education – Michael Otedola College of Primary Education and the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education – into universities of education. The same will apply to our polytechnic at Ikorodu.”
