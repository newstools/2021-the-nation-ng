Paul Onuachu dropped the biggest hint yet that he is leaving Racing Genk in the summer transfer window after accidentally revealing that it will be difficult for him to repeat his goal scoring exploits of the 2020-2021 campaign ‘where he is going’. The Nigeria international had a sensational campaign, plundering an impressive 35 goals in 41 games for Racing Genk in all competitions, which helped the Limburg club finish second in the Belgian First Division A and win the Belgian Cup. On Monday, he went home with the Player of the Year and Golden Boot at the Belgian Pro League awards held in Brussels. Having put himself in the shop window, a transfer is certainly in the offing and already he has been linked with possible moves to the Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1. Speaking to Genk’s official YouTube page, Onuachu said : “For me you never know what the future holds but I think scoring a lot of goals this season for KRC Genk and of course my career is going to be one of the most important periods for me. “It is going to be difficult to say I’m going to repeat it where I am going but I think the players we have in this team really make all this possible for me, but like I said earlier you don’t know what the future holds. “As it is now I think I’m really happy for the figure I have in the league and of course for KRC Genk”. The former FC Midtjylland man has a contract with Racing Genk for three more seasons.
