American rapper, Rakim Athelaston Mayers, popularly known as A$AP Rocky has officially confirmed his romance with singer, actress, fashion designer and businesswoman, Robyn Rihanna Fenty, popularly known as Rihanna over a year after dating rumours first swirled. In an interview with GQ for the magazine’s June/July 2021 cover story, when asked what it feels like to be in a relationship, A$AP Rocky said, “So much better. So much better when you got ‘the One.’ She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones. “I think when you know, you know. She’s the One,” he added. The 32-year-old rapper also shared his thoughts on starting a family, saying “fatherhood is “in my destiny, absolutely.” He continued: “I think I’m already a dad! All these motherfuckers are already my sons, whatchu talkin’ ’bout!” while laughing as he answered the question. “Rocky also expressed how much he prefers being in a relationship rather than being single.” Also in the cover story, the artist said that he and Rihanna went on a cross-country road trip together in a tour bus during quarantine. He also said Rihanna has “absolutely” inspired some of his upcoming new music — and that she offers feedback on his projects. The couple had sparked romance rumors since Rihanna split from her boyfriend of three years, billionaire Hassan Jameel, in January 2020. In July last year, Barbadian singer featured A$AP Rocky in her Fenty Skin campaign, and the duo did several interviews together to promote the collaboration. According to reports, the duo was spotted furniture shopping together on May 13 at Bend Goods on Melrose Ave. The 33-year-old “Rude Boy” singer also recently purchased the home next door to her Beverly Hills mansion.
