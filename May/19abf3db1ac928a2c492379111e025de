Max Air’s Abuja bound aircraft yesterday suffered a bird strike 10 minutes after take-off at the Aminu Kano International Airport, (MAKIA) Kano. The aircraft, according to sources, was forced to return to Kano. The Max Air B737 plane with registration number VM1645, which was slated for take-off at 1.30 pm had about a 30-minute delay. The aircraft later took off around 2:00 pm with full passenger load. A source close to the airline  confirmed the incident. He disclosed that the aircraft engine was hit by a bird during take-off, affecting some of the blades of the aircraft engine, forcing the captain of the aircraft to make an air-return, a standard practice in aviation to forestall an accident.
