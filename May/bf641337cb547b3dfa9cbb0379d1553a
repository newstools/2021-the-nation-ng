The Federal Government has kicked against the bill seeking to scrap the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). It assured that it had begun moves to reform the scheme. The Nation reports that the scheme recently came under heavy criticisms following the deteriorating security situation in the country. The Bill, sponsored presented last week by a lawmaker from Rivers State, Awaji Abiante, has reached the second reading in the House of Representatives. Abiante is proposing to use the Bill to amend Section 315 (1)(a) of the 1999 Constitution. The lawmaker argued that NYSC should be scrapped because the scheme has failed to address the essence of its establishment.  But Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, in a post on his official Twitter page, said the NYSC is one of the greatest tools for national development among Nigerian youths. Dare assured the nation that the Federal Government was undertaking dynamic reforms and initiatives to match the scheme with current realities, adding that the Muhammadu Buhari administration remained committed to sustaining it. “The NYSC scheme remains one of the greatest tools for national development for our youth.” “The commitment of the government to sustaining the NYSC scheme remains. Dynamic reforms and initiatives towards current realities are ongoing. Nigeria will stand with her youth,” he tweeted.
