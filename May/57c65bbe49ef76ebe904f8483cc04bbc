NIGERIA’S multiple award-winning crossover music star, Seun Bankole aka SB Live, is set for the 2021 U.S summer tour. Last year, the Lagos-based musician was scheduled for sold-out dates in America, Portugal, Spain, and France. But as he was about to start his tour in early 2020, COVID-19 broke out, and with the global shutdown, all the shows were canceled. Rather than be disappointed that he could not take to the stage to perform live for his numerous fans, SBLive and his band turned to zoom, sang their hearts out to millions of fans, digitally reached out to the public, and even gained a newer audience. But with the ease in restriction in many Western countries, SB Live – and his full band – is ready to return to the concert circuits in America and Europe. SBLive has concluded plans for his 2021 US Summer Tour that will run between July and October 2021. During the tour that will take the singer and his band across over 20 major US cities, he will be on stage at many concerts and VIP-studded private parties in cities like Rhode Island, Boston, Houston, and Dallas Texas, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Boston. In between the Summer Tour, SBLive will also be visiting Nigeria to honour already line-up private gigs and return to the US for the completion of his tour. After unarguably emerging as the most engaging act with an overwhelming stage presence, the suave singer has continued to dish out tunes after tunes to the delight of his fans who are yearning for his presence in the United States of America. SBLive – listed among the Top five Live Band Musicians in Nigeria – has turned into an embodiment of musical dexterity and skill.
