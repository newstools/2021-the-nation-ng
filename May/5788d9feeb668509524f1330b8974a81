Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Tuesday eulogised Pa Reuben Fasoranti, describing him as a great asset to the Yoruba and Nigerian nation at large. Akeredolu stated this in Akure at the dedication of Anglican Grammar School, Iju/Ita Ogbolu, renamed to honour Pa Fasoranti on his 95th birthday by the old students. The governor, represented by his Deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, said that the nonagenarian was part of those who fought for Nigeria to have democracy. He said the labour of heroes like the nonagenarian must not be in vain and called on everyone to rise up to keep Nigeria together. “The detail of the life history of baba is most typical of Yoruba men born in the 1920s. They all went through the educational system in and out of the country and came back home to help build the country. “He has fought a good fight of faith. He is a great asset to Yoruba nation and for some of us coming from behind, the labour of our heroes like this must not be in vain,” he said. Bishop of Akure Anglican Diocese, Rev. Simon Borokini, during sermon praised Pa Fasoranti for his dedication and doggedness. Borokini urged the congregation to live in peace with one another, adding that their minds must be devoid of hatred. He added that all hope was not lost as peace would return to Nigeria to be free from kidnapping and banditry, (NAN)
