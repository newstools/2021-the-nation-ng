Popular Nollywood actress, Iyabo Ojo has vowed to get justice for the 14-year-old allegedly molested sexually by embattled Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju James, aka Baba Ijesha. Iyabo Ojo said this in reaction to bail granted to Baba Ijesha by the Lagos State Police Command. Baba Ijesha, who has been in detention for weeks after he was arrested for alleged sexual molestation of a 14-year-old girl, was granted bail by the police on Monday. His Lawyer, Adesina Ogunlana said he was granted bail on health grounds. He explained his client was granted administrative bail by the police in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties. “The terms of the bail include two reliable sureties- a blood relation and a level 10 civil servant,” he said. Reacting in a video shared on Twitter, the popular actress slammed Nigerians, claiming the citizens are the problem of the country and not the government. According to the mother of two, Nigerians are not bothered about others and the country will only get better when people are concerned about others. “I used to think the government was our problem. I have come to understand that we are our own problem not the government. “The way we are wired, the way we think, it’s always all about us. Oh! She is not your child, why are pained about it? That’s the same problem we have in Nigeria.” “When someone like that gets to a place of power, they think about themselves and their people.” “We are the problem of Nigeria, the day we begin to take up issues that do not concern us and treat it like it is our own problem, Nigeria will begin to get better.” “I am that mother that will stand for that girl till the end. I am not backing down, justice will be served, thank you,” she said.
