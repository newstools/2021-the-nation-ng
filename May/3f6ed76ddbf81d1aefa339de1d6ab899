Two prominent Emirs of Katsina and Daura Alhaji Abdulmumi Kabir Usman and Alhaji Farouk Umar Farouk respectively have ordered cancellation of the Sallah Durbar procession also known as Hauwan Sallah, citing security challenges. A statement from the Secretary to the Emirate Council, Alhaji Bello Ifo, explained: “His Highness, the Emir of Katsina, (Dr) Abdulmumin Kabir Usman has asked me to notify you and the rest of people of Katsina State that due to security challenges in which our Muslim brothers in parts of the state are kidnapped or killed; and following advice from the State Government, security and the ministry of health; the Emirate has decided not to hold the Hauwan Sallah and other related ceremonies. “But as is tradition, people are allowed to go to the mosque for the Eid prayers, and supplications would be made for peace to reign in Katsina state and the country in general.” But a cross-section of the citizens, including prominent government officials, who pleaded anonymity, however, disagreed with the two monarchs on security. They told The Nation despite isolated cases of banditry attacks, the state had enjoyed relative peace in recent months. The Emirs however directed prayers for peace of Nigeria and Katsina should be held in mosques across the Emirates.
