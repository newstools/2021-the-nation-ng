The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is to make a total of 4,104 polling units available in Adamawa State for the 2023 elections. The new total will comprise existing 2,609 polling units and 1,495 voting points being converted into polling units. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) gave the indications on Wednesday, saying the conversion of the voting points to full-fledged polling units is ongoing. Adamawa Resident Commissioner of INEC, Kassim Gaidam, at a stakeholders’ interactive session in Yola, said converted VPs would be moved from the vicinities of PUs where they currently exist to outer locations where they would serve residents better. He explained conversion of VPs and relocation especially to new settlement areas was meant to enhance booth-level voter access. He said: “In Adamawa State, there are 1,495 VPs to be converted to PUs. The objective is to decongest booths with many VPs and address the big challenge of poor turnout or voter apathy during elections by locating such PUs in public buildings nearest to the people who are either unserved or underserved.” According to him, after all, VPs have become PUs, “focus will be on commencement of the continuous voter registration scheduled for June 28.” He assured all plans for the registration exercise are completed and urged those who have reached 18 years or transfer their registration, those with mutilated PVCs and those who have never registered before, to be ready for registration.
