President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ayuba on Tuesday dared Governor Nasir El-Rufai as he led the second day protest. The NLC President led the labour unionists on the day-two protest from NLC Secretariat at Golf Course road to NEPA Roundabout on Ahmadu Bello Way through Independence Way to Muhammadu Buhari Way. Meanwhile, when the protesters gathered at the NEPA roundabout, where the NLC president spoke on the state of workers in Kaduna state, armed thugs wielding matchets and sticks numbering over 50, disrupted the protest by throwing stones and other dangerous items at the Labour unionists. Police and other security personnel guarding the protesters were however able to repel the thugs with tear gas and one of them was later nabbed by the protesting workers and handed over to the Police. The protesters however retreated back to their secretariat after the invasion by the thugs to prevent further breakdown of law and order. Earlier, the Congress President, Comrade Wabba said he was daring Governor Nasir El-Rufai to arrest him. Wabba said the protest was not about him, but about the welfare of the generality of the workers, “So, we are here and waiting for them,” he declared.
