Victor Osimhen will work under new manager at Napoli next season after club president Aurelio De Laurentiis confirmed that coach Gennaro Gattuso will leave the club after failing to qualify for the Champions League. The southerners finished fifth, one point behind fourth-placed Juventus, after a 1-1 draw at home against Hellas VeronaÂ A win would have guaranteed a top four finish, but Napoli missed out on a second season of Champions League football. “Dear Rino, I am happy to have spent almost two seasons with you,” De Laurentiis wrote on Twitter. “Thanking you for your work, I wish you success wherever you go. A hug to your wife and children too. Aurelio De Laurentiis”. The relationship between the pair had been tense with the club having imposed a media boycott for months. Former AC Milan coach Gattuso took over after Carlo Ancelotti was sacked in December 2019. The 43-year-old also missed out on a Champions League return with AC Milan in the 2018-2019 season by just one point. The Italian 2006 World Cup winner as a player has been linked with clubs including Fiorentina and Tottenham.
