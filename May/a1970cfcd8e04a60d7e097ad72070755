Community leaders in Iba Local Council Development Area, Lagos, have appealed to the leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to field a former Sole Administrator of the council, Abiola Yisa as the party’s candidate in the forthcoming council poll. According to them, Yisa’s short stint as the council chief, attracted development to the LCDA. The Onu Igala of Iba, Zekeriyau Ata Odoma, said Abila as Yisa is fondly called, performed creditably and was detribalised during his reign at the council. “He helped the less privileged people a lot. That is why I can vouch for support from all Igala sons and daughters residing in Iba for him. I’m appealing to the APC to make him their candidate,” he said. An Igbo leader, Emeka Akparaegbum, said Abila brought Igbo together under one body when he was the council chief. Secretary of League of Chief Imams in Iba, Imam Najimudeen Aminullah, urged APC to give him the ticket. “People are saying many good things about him. He is gentle, God-fearing and that’s why I support him. Christian Association of Nigerian (CAN) Chairman in Iba, Reverend Esther Michael (JP), described Abila as a humble person. “Ever since I knew him, he doesn’t look down on anyone. He’s not a proud person. I urge all the Christians in Iba LCDA to support Abila. He will develop Iba when he gets there. I will advise the APC members in Iba to give him the mandate because he can do it and he will not disgrace APC,” she said. Secretary to Iba LCDA Alhaji Niyi Alape said Abila doesn’t discriminate against anybody. “I want to implore all party members to vote for Abila during primary. He’s a person we can trust. He performed well as a Sole Administrator. His doors are wide open for everybody. Iba will witness more development if Abila is eventually elected as the council chairman,” he said.
