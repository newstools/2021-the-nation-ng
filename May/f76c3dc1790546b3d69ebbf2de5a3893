Gunmen have abducted unspecified students of Abia State University (ABSU) Uturu. But The Nation learnt two of them escaped from the abductors. It was gathered the victims were seized from a mini bus heading to Uturu from Okigwe in Imo State. The incident, which has thrown the ABSU community into anguish, occurred between 7-8pm on Wednesday. Commissioner of Information, John Okiyi-Kalu, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. He said the students were attacked by gunmen in Imo State and not Abia State as being speculated on social and by mainstream media houses. Okiyi-Kalu, who said the Abia Government is monitoring development on the incident, said the two students were able to escape from their captors when they were marched into a nearby forest alongside other travelers. “When they ran into the armed gang who marched them into the nearby forest along with other yet to be identified travelers. “Two of the students managed to escape from the hoodlums while others are still being held at a yet to be identified location. “We are working with the government of Imo State and relevant security agencies in both states to ensure the rescue of the abducted students and others. “Members of the public and ABSU community are advised to remain calm as we will spare no resource in ensuring the safety of the victims. “No criminal operating within our environment will be allowed to escape justice as we take the job of protecting lives and property of Abians and visitors to the State very seriously,” he said.
