  United Bank for Africa (UBA) has rewarded 10 of its loyal customers with N10 million in the quarterly draws of its ongoing UBA savings promo. The quarterly promo is to appreciate loyal customers who have stayed with the bank over the years, and offer fresh opportunities for potential and intending customers to join the growing number of UBA millionaires. The virtual electronic draw which held at the weekend, was transmitted via zoom and facebook. UBA’s Head Personal Banking, Osita Ede, said there was no better time to give back and delight customers than this challenging economic period where people need all the support they can get to make life more meaningful. He said: “As a bank, UBA has been rewarding customers; we have been doing this for several years now; from the Wise Savers Promo, Bumper Draws, and now this. We have been doing this to touch lives and to show appreciation to our customers; to tell them we are grateful for their business. This is also an opportunity to reward them for their loyalty to the bank.” Ede added that the promo is also a way of encouraging savings towards promoting financial inclusion, as statistics show that a lot of Nigerians are still largely underbanked. “Our key objective is to encourage our customers to save regularly. We are here to support them and encourage them to save and ultimately grow as well, because we are aware that they are invaluable to all that we do,” he added. The winners are Emeka Onyemauche; Ezeigbokwe Oluebube Purity; Omoniyi A Jaiyeola; Olawale Omotayo Idowu; Zaharadeen Yandaki Umar; Aliyu Yaro Bakari; Samuel Enan Esua; Joseph Eze; Deborah Folusho Adebayo and Lucia Chinyere Adim.
