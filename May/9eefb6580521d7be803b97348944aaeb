The police in Akwa Ibom on Thursday dismissed the rumour that Mr. Uduak Ezekiel Akpan, the suspected killer of Miss Iniubong Umoren committed suicide in its police custody. Social media has been awash with news that 20-year Akpan, who allegedly lured Miss Umoren with a job offer and subsequently raped and killed her, has killed himself. It was reported on social media that the suspect hung himself with his trousers tied to metal after having his meal. Following reports of the suicide, some individuals and groups had accused the police of foul play and attempt to cover up the crime. But the State Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme dismissed the suicide rumour, describing it as the handiwork of mischief-makers. He told the Nation on the telephone, ”It is not true that Uduak Akpan has committed suicide. The suspect is in our custody. Maybe he committed suicide in the bedrooms of those peddling the rumour.”
