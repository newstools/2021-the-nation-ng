The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep Ahmed Idris Wase, has urged Muslims in the country to use the period of the Eid-el-Fitr to reflect on their spiritual lives as individuals. He also urged Muslims to reflect on how they can contribute more meaningfully towards the unity, stability and progress of Nigeria. The Deputy Speaker also urged Nigerians to be conscious of their health by strictly adhering to the COVID-19 protocols. He further stated that the recent outbreak of the third wave in some countries is a source for concern for all Nigerians. In a Sallah message issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Umar Muhammad Puma, Wase called on all Nigerians to be more dedicated to the Nigerian project. He said with unity of purpose, building a virile and strong nation is achievable. The Deputy Speaker said despite the serious security challenges confronting the nation, the determination of Nigerians to see their country return to peace has never been in doubt. He said leaders at all levels must close ranks and work for the unity and progress of the nation. He urged all Nigerians to always remember the less-privileged at all times. “I implore us to apply those attributes learnt during the holy month in our engagements after Ramadan. Only by so doing we can truly say we have imbibed the teachings of the Holy month into our everyday lives,” he said.
