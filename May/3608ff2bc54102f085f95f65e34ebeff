Moses Simon and his club FC Nantes will play in the French Ligue 1 again next season despite losing 1-0 at home to Toulouse in second leg playoff and a major controversial call. Nantes won the first leg of the playoffs 2-1 at Toulouse and that was what proved their saving grace as that meant they scored more away goals than their opponents. ‘The Canaries’ were further saved the shame of demotion when the referee did not award a penalty against them nine minutes from full time for a glaring hand ball inside the box.
