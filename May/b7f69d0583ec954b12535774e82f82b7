President of the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC), Peter Timothy Igbifa, has escaped following an accident that occurred along the Mbiama axis of the East-West on Sunday. It was gathered Igbifa was on his way to Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, to join celebration of the famous Boro Day when his vehicle plunged into a big pothole and tumbled three times. The vehicle, Toyota Camry, reportedly landed in the bush and was damaged beyond repairs. But Igbifa and other occupants of the vehicle, including his orderly were said to have escaped unhurt. The IYC boss confirmed the development and gave God the glory for saving him.
