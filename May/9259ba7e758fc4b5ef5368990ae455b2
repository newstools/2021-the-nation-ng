Kelechi Iheanacho’s goal against Crystal Palace has won Leicester City’s goal of the season, but the striker misses out on the player of the year award. Iheanacho’s brilliant left-footed finish after receiving a pass from Jonny Evans gave the Foxes a 2-1 win over the Eagles. Leicester City chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha and head coach Brendan Rodgers presented the Nigerian striker with the award. However, Iheanacho missed out on the players’ player of the year award and supporters’ player of the year award, which both went to Youri Tielemans. Iheanacho was one of Leicester’s best players this season. The 24-year-old has scored 19 goals and provided seven assists ahead of the final game of the season on Sunday. The ex-Manchester City man was key to Leicester’s first FA Cup title, scoring against Brighton, Manchester United and Southampton. This season, no player has a better goal per game ratio in the Premier League than the Nigerian international.
