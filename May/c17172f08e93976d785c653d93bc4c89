Barcelona and Atletico Madrid handed Real Madrid a LaLiga title race advantage after seeing out a stalemate at Camp Nou on Saturday. Should Los Blancos beat beat fourth-placed Sevilla on Sunday, they will move top of the table – level on 77 points with Atletico – but into first place given their superior head-to-head record with just three games to play. Barca moved up to second place on Saturday with 75 points, and defender Gerard Pique insists the Blaugrana are still in with a chance of the title. “We’re still in the mix. La Liga’s still wide open, three games is a lot even if we know it’s not in our hands anymore,” Pique said.
