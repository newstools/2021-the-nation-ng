 FAST-RISING gospel act Peterson Okopi has recently unveiled the art cover to his debut gospel album under a new recording label TWC records. After signing the dotted lines with the record label a year ago, Okopi unveiled his debut album entitled ‘Osuba.’ During a media chat and album listening session, Okopi revealed that the album has 13 tracks and they include Osuba, Nobody, and Ibibio Medley. Explaining how he began his musical journey and the inspiration behind his album name, the music minister said “Music has been a thing from birth, there has always been a sound hidden in me and it just needed time to manifest. We were all born with a gift so I will say since when I was born. Choosing Osuba (Praises of God) as the title of this album is an experience, it is not just a song and bedsides I am not from the west I am from Benue State, but then we go the way the Lord wants us to go and Osuba has been in motion in this very season of ours and so that is why we want people to be able to relate that this song also birthed other songs”, he said. Speaking on challenges as an up and coming act in the gospel industry and funds to promote his song, he noted that “The Lord ordered my steps here and we will only do the bidding of the Lord which is to propagate the goodness of God in the land of the living. So, I don’t believe money will be a problem for us because we have Jesus we have all. I didn’t come here with the mindset of business, I came here with the mindset of the kingdom of God and that is what has been happening. The gospel will thrive as the Bible says and nothing can take its place.”
