Soldiers have returned to the military base in Allawa and Bassa communities in Shiroro local government area of Niger state one month after the bandits attack. It would be recalled that the attack on the military base had resulted in the death of five soldiers and a mobile policeman. The soldiers arrived at the communities in a military convoy that had 10 Hilux vans and 100 motorcycles. The Nation learnt that there was jubilation and excitement when the soldiers arrived as people came out of their houses to wave and greet them. There had been frantic calls for the return of the soldiers who were withdrawn due to the attack on the military base. During the withdrawal of the soldiers, the banditry attacks on communities around the area increased as the bandits operated unhindered.
