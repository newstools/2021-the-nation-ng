Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer accepts this season has not been a success for Manchester United but believes his squad has the right characters to do better next term. United lost to Villarreal in the Europa League final after David de Gea’s spot-kick was saved in an epic shootout. The Red Devils finished second in the Premier League but have not won a trophy since 2017. Asked if this season had been a success, Solskjaer said: “No. Speaking to BT Sport, he added: “We need to get better, simple as. “We’ve done really well this season coming through. The start was difficult. We had no pre-season and lost three of the first six. “We pushed in the league, maybe got closer to the top than we thought and we got to a final. But you need to win the finals to make it a good season.” Former United midfielder Paul Scholes, speaking as part of BT Sport’s punditry team, questioned whether United’s players hurt enough after a defeat. But Solskjaer stood up for his team and believes they possess the right character to respond positively to Wednesday’s defeat in Gdansk. “We have a strong, competitive squad. The spirit in the squad is good. They’re gutted in there,” he said. “Now is not the time to point the finger at what I’d have done differently. But when you come out without the trophy you haven’t done everything right. “We’re getting closer and closer and better. We were one kick away from a trophy and a good night. “We have to have the desire to come back next year and improve. The only way to get the margins your side is to work harder and better.” BBC
