As part of its commitment to advance the Central Bank of Nigeria’s backward integration programme to enhance capacity and boost local milk production, CHI Limited has made substantial progress in massive infrastructural development, co-ordination of local farmers/herders and procurement of 300 hybrid cows (heifers) for cross breeding at the Bobi Grazing Reserve, a pilot grazing reserve in Mariga Local Government, Niger State. To this end, CHI Limited has virtually concluded (90%) of the feeder road construction leading to its site at the reserve and rehabilitated/reconstructed the dam with a size of 250m by 1200m by 4m with an average depth of 12,000,000 cubic meters of water. The CBN fact-finding committee adjudged this dam as the best in the grazing reserve. To improve human capacity skills at the reserve, CHI Limited is partnering with Sahel Group (ALDDN), on future training of local farmers in Bobi and mapping of local dairy production in Ogun State as an additional initiative to bolster milk production opportunities. In the short term, the company is also finalising arrangements with the management of Maizube Farms to process milk at their plant. CHI Limited Managing Director, Mr. Deepanjan Roy, stated that the company’s massive investment in infrastructure and human capacity development at the Bobi Grazing Reserve will ensure a boost in local milk production. “We want to reiterate our commitment to strengthen the backwards integration policy to boost dairy production in the country with the massive investment in infrastructural and human capacity development at the Bobi Grazing Reserve.  In partnership with the Niger state Government, we will be driving the project as a model for backward integration on a commercial scale,” he said.
