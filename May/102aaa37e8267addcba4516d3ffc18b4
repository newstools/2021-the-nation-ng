The crisis rocking the Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State (FUOYE), seems to have worsened, following the suspension of the Bursar, Mrs. Bolatito Akande. The suspension, contained in a letter dated May 5, 2021 and signed by the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Abayomi Fasina, happened a few days after the Registrar, Mr. Olatunbosun Odusanya, was sacked over alleged infractions. According to the letter titled ‘Suspension from the University’, Mrs. Akande was suspended by the Governing Council at its 4th extraordinary meeting held on April 27. It added that she was suspended to allow investigation into the allegations of gross misconduct levelled against her by the unions in the university. Addressing reporters on Sunday in Ado-Ekiti, Akande described her suspension as unconstitutional and illegal, saying she had not committed any offence that could warrant her suspension.
