The dream to have the national teams return to action either at the Surulere National Stadium or the Moshood Abiola National Stadium Abuja may soon become a reality as construction work at the two stadia have reached advanced stage. The planting of the hybrid Bermuda grass at the National Stadium Surulere is in the final stage , just as that of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. Said one of the site engineers: “We are in the final stage of construction, as I speak to you we are planting the grass to ensure that before the end of June/July, the stadium can be ready for international matches. There’s no better way to appreciate the Sports Minister, Mr. Sunday Dare other than to complete the job on schedule. “The Minister has been on our neck with proper monitoring with the mandate that we must get the stadium ready in due course.” The site engineer saluted the efforts of the minister and assured that the project will be completed on time.
