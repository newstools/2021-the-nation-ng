Chelsea will meet Manchester City in the Champions League final on May 29 after goals from Timo Werner and Mason Mount secured them a 2-0 victory over Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge to seal the tie 3-1 on aggregate. Christian Pulisic’s away goal in the 1-1 first-leg draw in Madrid gave Chelsea the advantage heading into the second leg, and Werner’s first-half header put them on course to a second European Cup final in two years for Thomas Tuchel, whose PSG were beaten by Bayern Munich last season. Zinedine Zidane’s Real could not deal with Chelsea’s quick counter-attacking, and the only reason the Spanish giants were not humiliated in west London was the astonishing amount of second-half chances the Blues missed.
