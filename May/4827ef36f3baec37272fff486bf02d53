A teacher, Mr. Ejovi, has died in a road accident along Airport road in Effurun, Uvwie council area of Delta state. The Nation gathered the incident occurred around 4pm on Wednesday in front of a first generation bank, near DSTV office. It was learnt the deceased was in a tricycle, alongside four others, including the rider, when a truck loaded with blocks rammed into them, pressing the Keke NAPEP against a stationary heavy duty vehicle left on the side of the ever-busy road. Witnesses said two of the passengers jumped out, another two struggled out but it took a while for the deceased to be pulled out by sympathisers. His face was reportedly badly injured as he was said to have hit his head on the stationary vehicle. According to reports, a sachet water distributing truck, which was driving against traffic, caused the accident. “The block driver was on speed. So they (block and sachet water drivers) met at the point where the stationary vehicle part was parked. “As the block guy tried to give room for the incoming vehicle, he just hit the Keke Napep, pressing it to the parked trailer part,” a witness, who gave his name as Paul, narrated. He added the deceased was rushed to a hospital but later died. Ejovi, who was described as a loyal, jovial and easy-going person, was an Agricultural Science teacher at Basic College, Edjeba in Warri South council area. When contacted, the Delta State Police Command, through its acting spokesman, DSP Edafe Bright, said it was unaware of the incident.
