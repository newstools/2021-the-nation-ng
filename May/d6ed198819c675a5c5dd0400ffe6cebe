Nine-time African champions Nigeria will face World champions USA in an international friendly tournament in Austin, Texas next month. The match, which will take place at the brand-new, Q2 Stadium, as part of fixtures of this year’s WNT Summer Series Invitational that will also have Portugal and Jamaica in attendance. The tournament, which was also held in 2017 and 2018, will run between 10th – 16th June and will see the Super Falcons clashing with their Jamaican counterparts in Houston on the 10th before taking on Portugal three days later at the same BBVA Stadium. The African champion final game will be against the USA squad, who are four-time winners of the FIFA World Cup and four-time winners of the Olympic football gold, at the Q2 Stadium on 16th June. The match will be the Falcons’ first time to play against the USA outside of a world championship and first time since Abby Wambach’s only goal gave the Americans a narrow 1-0 win over the Falcons at a FIFA Women’s World Cup Group D match in 2015 in Canada. Both teams have met five times previously, with four coming at the FIFA Women’s World Cup, and one in the Women’s Olympic Football Tournament. Meanwhile, Falcons’ coach, Randy Waldrum says the Summer Series will be a great way for the team to continue their preparations for next year’s Women Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco. “The Summer Series is an interesting event and the teams featuring are of very high quality,” the ex-Trinidad and Tobago manager said. “It is a great prospect for us as we continue to build ahead of the qualifying games for next year’s Women Africa Cup of Nations.”
