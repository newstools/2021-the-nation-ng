Nigerian equities closed weekend with a net capital depreciation of N416 billion as low demand amid profit-taking transactions left most quoted equities at lower prices. Investors took flight to safety to the banking sector, with increased demand for top-tier banking stocks. Benchmark index for the Nigerian stock market, the All Share Index (ASI0 of the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited, indicated average decline of 1.60 per cent at the weekend. The steep decline during the week pushed the negative average year-to-date return for Nigerian equities to -2.66 per cent. Against the background of the negative market position, increased demand for leading banking stocks drove the benchmark index for the banking sector up by 0.62 per cent. Transactions in three tier 1 banks – Access Bank Plc, FBN Holdings Plc and Zenith Bank Plc – accounted for nearly half of the total turnover for the week. Analysts were dividend on immediate to short-term outlook for Nigerian equities as investors weigh returns in the fixed-income market against the risks of publicly quoted shares. While some analysts expected a rebound in the days ahead on the back of bargain-hunting, others said there were no strong triggers to drive broad price appreciation in the immediate period. The ASI closed weekend at 39,198.75 points as against its week’s opening index of 39,834.42 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NGX depreciated from the week’s opening value of N20.847 trillion to close weekend at N20.431 trillion. The overall decline was exacerbated by the voluntary delisting of a major downstream oil and gas company, 11 Plc, at the weekend. Adjusted for the delisting, net depreciation due to share prices movements stood at about N333.6 billion. Also, at the NASD OTC Securities Exchange, the over-the-counter platform for trading in unlisted public securities, the NASD OTC Securities Exchange Index (NSI) declined by 1.50 per cent to close weekend at 778.03 points as against the week’s opening index of 789.89 points. Investors at the NASD lost N8.43 billion as the NASD OTC market capitalisation droped from its opening value of N561.46 billion to close weekend at N553.03 billion. Analysis of share price movements at the NGX showed that the negative overall market position was largely driven by selloffs among large-cap stocks, especially in the highly influential industrial goods sector. The NGX 30 Index, which tracks the 30 largest stocks at the Exchange, recorded above average decline of 1.94 per cent. The NGX Industrial Goods Index dropped by 1.60 per cent while the NGX Insurance Index dipped by 2.20 per cent. Meanwhile, the NGX Oil and Gas Index recorded impressive gain of 5.98 per cent while the NGX Consumer Goods Index and NGX Banking Index rode on the back of increased demand to close with a gain of 0.62 per cent each. Total turnover at the NGX during the four-day trading week stood at 1.419 billion shares worth N15.918 billion in 18,459 deals as against a total of 1.441 billion shares valued at N10.883 billion in 19,614 deals recorded in the previous week. The bank-led financial services sector remained the most active with a turnover of 1.069 billion shares valued at N9.531 billion traded in 10,907 deals; thus contributing 75.34 per cent and 59.88 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value. The industrial goods sector followed with 60.762 million shares worth N2.005 billion in 1,070 deals while consumer goods sector placed third with a turnover of 57.023 million shares worth N1.029 billion in 2,831 deals. Trading in the top three equities, namely Access Bank Plc, FBN Holdings Plc and Zenith Bank Plc, accounted for 609.988 million shares worth N6.593 billion in 4,870 deals, contributing 43 per cent and 41.42 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value “In the coming week, we anticipate a rebound as investors take advantage of bargain hunting opportunities,” analysts at Afrinvest Securities stated. Analysts at Cordros Securities said there might be more price depreciation than appreciation as yields at the fixed income markets are expected to moderate equities pricing. According to analysts, with the end of first quarter 2021 earnings season, there would be a “choppy theme” as investors keep their gaze on yield movements in the fixed income market. “The bears will likely maintain dominance as the absence of positive triggers will limit buying interest from the bulls.  Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated. The negative performance of the Nigerian equities bucked the global optimism that greeted improved global economic recovery. From America to Europe, Asia and Middle East, most stock markets closed on the upside. United States’ Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S & P rose by 2.0 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. In United Kingdom, the FTSE 100 Index appreciated by 1.9 per cent. The STOXX Europe, which tracks European markets rose by 1.1 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 appreciated by 1.9 per cent.
