A support group, Buhari for All, has donated 7,200 bags of rice to Adamawa Muslims. The national chairman of the group, Hon Aminu Sani Jaji, said the gesture was to identify with Muslim faithful during Ramadan fasting. He said at a hotel in the Adamawa State capital, Yola where the distribution of the rice was flagged off that similar gesture would be extended to Christians as support during the Christmas period. Jaji, who said the rice would be shared across the 21 LGAs, urged stakeholders to be just in the distribution to ameliorate the suffering of the masses. Adamawa caretaker chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Ibrahim Bilal, thanked the group for coming to the aid of the less privileged in the state. He commended them for distributing the items through a committee led by Sen Aishatu Binani, the senator representing Adamawa Central zone in the National Assembly. He noted with such a notable personality, he is confident the rice would reach those for whom it is intended. Bilal clarified the donation is not meant for only APC members but for all Muslim communities across the state.
