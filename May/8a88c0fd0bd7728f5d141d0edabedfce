The French Embassy in Nigeria has called on stakeholders and Lagos residents to join the conversation on tackling climate change. A discourse the embassy is holding with the theme, “Dialogue in Lagos: Are we doing enough in the fight against climate change?” will also deliberate on how to improve environmental cooperation between Nigeria and France. It is scheduled to take place tomorrow at 2p.m. at the Alliance Francaise, Mike Adenuga Centre, 9 Osborne Rd, Ikoyi, Lagos. The ideas and opinions developed at the conversation will be shared with the participants at the New Africa-France Summit in Montpellier holding in July. The organisers said the event will be a unique opportunity for youths from all over Africa to exchange with the French President Emmanuel Macron, without taboo, about topics engaging France and Africa together such as climate change, innovation, health, restitution of cultural heritage and contemporary creativity. The panelists will include: Muhammad Buhari, Inter Campus Alliance for Sustainable Cities (ICASC); Rachel Ikemeh, South West Niger Delta Project; Amara Nwankpa, Shehu Yar’Adua Foundation; and Tosin Kehinde Oshinowo, architect, director of the CmDesign Atelier. The moderators are Prof. Chinedum Nwajiuba, Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team and Dr. Tancrède Voituriez, senior researcher at the CIRAD.
