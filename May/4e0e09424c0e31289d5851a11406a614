Kelechi Iheanacho has become the first player in Premier League history to score a goal on all seven days of the week within a single season. The striker was on target for Leicester City in a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in Tuesday’s league encounter. Furthermore, the 24-year-old now boasts 12 goals in 24 outings so far in the 2020-21 campaign. Overall, he is Leicester’s highest goal scorer in all competitions this term with 19 goals – four more than veteran Jamie Vardy. Iheanacho’s brilliance this year has been rewarded after he was named the Premier League player of March. He is equally in line to be recognised as the league’s best player for April.
