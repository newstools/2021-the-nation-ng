There was uneasy calm at the Defence Headquarters, Friday, as the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff, Major General Farouk Yahaya, assumed Command of the Nigerian Army. A handful of Army Generals received the Army Chief at the Quarter Guard, where he inspected a Guard of Honour. Although there was no formal handing over, the Chief of Army Staff met with the Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor, behind closed doors. Shortly after the meeting with the CDS, Yahaya went into another closed door meeting with Principal Staff Officers (PSO) and Commanders. At the meeting were the Army Chief of Policy and Plans Major General Benjamin Ahanotu and other members of Course 35 and 36. The new Army Chief is a member of 37 Regular Course. It was reported that serving members of Course 35, 36 and 37 may be asked proceed on compulsory retirement. Shortly after the meeting with the PSOs, Yahaya drove out of the Defence Headquarters.
