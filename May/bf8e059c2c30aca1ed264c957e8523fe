Super Eagles striker Paul Onuachu has been named among the three finalists for the 2020/21 Pro Footballer of the Year award, after enjoying a stunning season with KRC Genk. The other two nominees are Club Brugges Dutchman Noa Lang and Beerschot’s forward Raphael Holzhauser. Lang, who only arrived from Ajax in the summer, is the elegant 21-year-old attacking midfielder whose 16 goals and 11 assists in all competitions powered Brugges to the league title. Holzhauser was the architect of newly-promoted Beerschot’s incredible rise to the top of the league during the first-half of the season with the Austrian eventually contributing 16 goals and 16 assists in 34 matches. Genk’s Onuachu, though, is the favourite for the prestigious honour. The former FC Midtjylland star made the headlines almost every week as he smashed 33 goals to help Racing finish runners-up on the First Division A table. The Pro League will present the prize to the winner on Monday at a traditional gala to be hosted at the JAM hotel in Brussels.
