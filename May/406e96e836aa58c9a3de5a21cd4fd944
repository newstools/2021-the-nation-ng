Several students have been feared abducted in an Islamiyya school at Tegina in Rafi local government area of Niger state. Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School was built by a retired immigration officer in Tegina town. The school is located close to the Tegina police station. The abduction came some months after 27 students, 3 staff and 12 members of their family from Kagara Science College, Kagara in the same Rafi local government area, were kidnapped. The Nation learnt one person from the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) was shot dead in the attack that left several others injured. The attack started around 3:45 pm when bandits invaded the town, shooting sporadically and forcing residents to take cover. The Nation learnt the bandits separated smaller and weaker students from elderly and strong ones before taking them away. Director General of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ibrahim Ahmed Inga, confirmed the incident. He however said details were not known yet. Sources hinted the abducted students could be as many as 200 but The Nation could not confirm this. Niger Government also confirmed the attack but said the number of abducted students were yet to be known. Chief Press Secretary to Niger Governor, Mary Noel Berje, in a statement said: “A number of conventional Islamiyya students of Salihu Tanko Islamic School Tegina in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State have been abducted. “The number of abducted students of the Islamiyya is yet to be confirmed as the very little ones that cannot go through the bush path were released “However two people were shot in the cause of the attack with one person confirmed dead while the other person is critically injured. “The State Government is still gathering detail security report on the attack so as to take necessary measures to secure the release of those kidnapped.” Niger Police spokesman DSP Wasiu Abiodun said a statement would be issued soon on the incident.
