Super Eagles remain the 32nd  best team in the world and third-best in Africa in the latest FIFA Ranking as the top 50 teams retained  their last month’s positions. With Belgium still topping the ranking, Senegal remains Africa’s best-rated team in the world occupying 22nd in the ranking. Tunisia held on to their second spot in Africa and rated 26th in the world ranking. The Coach Gernot Rohr-tutored side occupies 32nd place in the world and the third-best team in Africa and Nigeria is closely followed by African champion Algeria who are 33rd in the world ranking. With next week’s friendly match against Cameroon in view as well as the tie in the faraway United States of America against Mexico in readiness for the Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers, the Eagles may gain some points for the next ranking. According to FIFA, only one match played since the last edition was published – a Ukraine-Bahrain friendly that ended all square (1-1) – the Top 50 remains unchanged, with Belgium leading the way from France and Brazil.
