 As part of his Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR), Nigerian-American rapper, King Joel has offered to celebrate Mothers’ Day with N2.5m Naira giveaway. According to Joel, there is a need to appreciate mothers for their impact on every child’s upbringing. “The role of a mother in a child’s life cannot be overemphasised as they are responsible for the proper molding of whatever a child becomes in future; hence the need to always appreciate them is important,” he said.  Continuing, the rapper said, “mothers need to go to my page on Instagram and drop a comment and a winner will be selected and announced in a week. A cash prize of N1 million will be presented while the three other lucky mothers will get N500,000 each.” The rapper, however, promised to return to the Nigerian music industry with his upcoming project.
