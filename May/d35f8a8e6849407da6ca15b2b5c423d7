Mexico’s leading goal scorer, Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez, will not take any part in the Tricolor’s friendly match against the Super Eagles in Los Angeles on July 3. Team coach Tata Martino also opted to leave the former Manchester United striker from the team’s roster for its upcoming CONCACAF Nations League Finals, explaining that the team has enough firepower in the attacking department with the likes of Napoli’s Hirving Lozano and Sporting Kansas City’s Alan Pulido making the team. The LA Galaxy forward tops Mexico’s scoring list with 52 goals in 109 games but has not played for the North Americans since  a 3-0 win over the United States in September 2019.  He had been on a poor run of form for the forward, first in Spain with Sevilla, where he only played nine matches in the first half of the season and scored once. He then moved to southern California to join the Galaxy, but scored only twice in 12 games in 2020. The former  Real Madrid loanee has been in a rich vein of form this year, scoring seven goals in five games to start the MLS season.
