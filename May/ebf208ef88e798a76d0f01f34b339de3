  The Diocesan Bishop of the Diocese of Lagos West, Rt. Revd Olusola Odedeji has called for an amendment to the 1999 Constitution to recognise state police and regional security outfits. Speaking during the church’s synod, he called for the declaration of a state of emergency on insecurity without further delay. He said this should include wholesale security reforms, and instituting necessary measures towards running an inclusive government. He said: “All over, the threat level is rife. It will be dangerous to allow Nigeria to slide into war…whereas it is already in a war situation, even if it is not yet a full-blown war.  “The nation is bleeding; blood is flowing here and there. People are living in palpable fear. Several factors are to blame, most of them self-inflicted. “The President must clamp down on this anomaly decisively; Nigeria is now experiencing failed institutions, weakened national cohesion and hegemonic stance as fallouts of insecurity.” Bishop Odedeji added that “some sections of the South now view the presence of armed pastoralists as a ‘Fulanisation’ plot aimed at land grabbing”. He called for an amendment to the Constitution to accommodate regional security outfits such as Amotekun in the Southwest and Ebube Agu in the Southeast.
