Former Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar(Rtd) has advised the Federal Government to forget every infrastructural development and divert all necessary fundings to secure peace across the nation. According to Abdulsalam, if there is no peace, there cannot be a country. He appealed to the Federal Government to stop every unnecessary development and focus on security. Abdulsalam spoke when Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, visited him to commiserate over the death of father of Senator Sani Musa, the Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District. He said: ” My suggestion is that due to the overstretching of our security forces, I think, all the necessary fundings should be given to the security forces. “I suggest that we look at the unnecessary development issues in the country and do the needful to make life bearable and let us face this insecurity by diverting the necessary fundings to secure peace in this country. If there is no peace, there will be no country.” Abdulsalam further prayed those making life difficult for Nigerians will give peace a chance. Lawan appreciated advice of the elder statesman, saying the courage, resolve and determination of Nigerians would help the nation surmount its current challenges. The Senate President said majority of Nigerians still want Nigeria to remain one, stating those calling for segregation of the country should be properly guided.
