There is palpable tension in Ifite Isuaniocha community, Awka North Local Government Area of Anambra state following alleged importation of suspected herdsmen in the area. Some residents were said to have abandoned their homes and fled the area following a viral rumour on the social media alleging arrival of a vehicle loaded with herdsmen in the community. The report purportedly issued by the President General of the community, Amb Frank Mkpume, revealed the vehicle zoomed off immediately after dropping the suspected strange elements, enjoining residents to be careful and vigilant. A resident of the area,who preferred anonymity, said the report threw the entire community into confusion and jittery as many hurriedly fled the area while others kept vigil the day the message got to them. He said: “Last night was one of the longest nights I have ever had as a human being. The message came in very late at about 11:30pm about the allegedly armed Fulani men, who were brought into a forest near a vast fallowed land purchased by INEC staff at Isuaniocha. “It was vigil last night for everyone resident in Isuaniocha and nearby Mgbakwu (where I live). As I speak, many families have moved to Awka, abandoning their homes. “Please I join the PG to call on the government to investigate this matter to prevent any possible attacks on the people, as is being feared. Urgent step needs to be taken now please.” Reacting, Police spokesperson, Ikenga Tochukwu said the the Command had since deployed Police team, calling on residents not to panic but to remain calm. He said: “The command has since deployed Police team on the receipt of this information and while noting the area is calm, urges the good people of Anambra especially those in the area not to panic but work with the Police and other security agencies in identifying the bad elements among them.”
