The clan head of Ikot Offoing Ambi in Akpabuyo Local Government of Cross River State, Etinyin Akamba 1 Effiom Eyo Okon, has said he has been vindicated by subsequent development after the destruction of his property on the allegation that he aided and abetted kidnapping. The 90-year-old monarch, whose bungalow and other valuables were destroyed by the joint security task force of the state government code- named Operation Akpakwu, said four days after the attack, “there is a claim now that I have been dethroned as the clan head and the man who has been battling with me over land in the community is purported to have replaced me without any indictment or conviction against me by any court.” He added: “The destruction of my property was based on false information. It was premeditated. I petitioned the governor that some persons were looking for a way to get rid of me, or occupy my position, or settle old scores.” The nonagenarian cried out that he is homeless, as invaluable items, including historical documents, were set ablaze while destroying his property. “Imagine, they came to my house, they found nothing incriminating, yet they destroyed my property and set ablaze historical documents. Four days after, they held a meeting at the Council of Chiefs Chambers in Calabar. I was not invited. No finding has been made, yet they claimed that I have been dethroned and the person who is court with me over land matter in our community is the one that is said to have been made the new clan head.”
