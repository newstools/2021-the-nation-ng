The Ondo State Security Network Agency codenamed Amotekun Corps has evicted another 137 illegal occupants of forest reserve across the state. Those evicted were suspected to constitute security threats to the state. They were picked at Elegbeka forest along the Akure-Owo-Ifon road few days after they arrived the state. Last week, 42 persons were arrested and sent back to their home states after they could not give satisfactory answers on their mission to the state. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu vowed to evict occupants of forest reserves who fail to register with government. Ondo Commander of Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said the 137 illegal occupants would be escorted out of the state to where they came from. “We got an Intel that very many people bombarded (forests at) Elegbeka–Ifon area in the state. “We moved in and on questioning majority of them said they were from the northern part of the country and others said they are from Ogun state. “We asked for their mission and they were not able to give us a clear cut of what they are here for. We brought some of them (to Akure) and there sponsors here to the headquarters (of Amotekun) for proper investigation. “We profiled them and we found out that they were conniving with some persons in Ose to be given space for settlement in the government’s forest reserve which makes them illegal occupants of the forests. “We are sending them back to where they claimed they came from,” Adeleye said.
