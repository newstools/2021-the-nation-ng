In the meeting held at the command headquarters, the CP said it was in pursuance of the recently launched Operation Restore Peace in the Southeast Geopolitical Zone by the Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Baba Usman. He spoke to the leaders and other law-abiding citizens of the state, on the need for sustained support to the command, in its bid to professionally stabilize security order in the state through the operation.
