The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has set agenda for the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Major General Farouk Yahaya. It asked him to ensure inter-agency collaboration in resolving the lingering security challenges in the country. APC Secretary Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanduoehehe, in a statement in Abuja on Thursday, urged the new Army Chief to consolidate on the successes recorded by the military in tackling all security threats. Akpanduoehehe charged him to be more vigilant, ensure increased cooperation and support through sharing information that can pave way for faster mopping up the remnants of the insurgents and ending banditry and kidnapping in parts of the country. The party said: “This could be achieved and deepened sustainably through increased collaboration among the security services and communities. “More vigilance and increased cooperation and support through sharing information can pave way for faster mopping up the remnants of the insurgents and ending banditry and kidnapping in parts of the country.” The party told him to justify President’s confidence in him by doing everything to stem the tide of insecurity. It maintained “the success of the military is our collective success as a party and nation. “The APC as an institution congratulates the new Chief of Army Staff and wish him success in his new, important and strategic national assignment.”
