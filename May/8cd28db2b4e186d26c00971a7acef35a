The Chief Executive Officer of Henry Montego Homes, Henry Ebuluofor has offered business grants to 13 Nigerian Small and medium-sized enterprises(SME’s) to start up their businesses. Each beneficiary received N200,000 to expand their business and create four jobs for others. While addressing the beneficiaries at the presentation of cheques at his office in Lagos, Ebuluofor said through the initiative tagged ‘Henry Gives’, he aimed to touch many lives and help others reach their potential in business so as they grow, the multiplier effect will translate to a reduction in unemployment in the society. Ebuluofor said the gesture was borne out of his struggle to start a business some years ago with N35,000, noting that when he tried to expand the business, he was unable to secure loans. The real estate guru noted that he started a business to make a change adding that the company is the first real estate firm in the country to introduce payment plans that allow Nigerians to move into their homes while they are still paying up to five years. Speaking on how beneficiaries were selected, Ebuluofor stated that they invited people on social media to indicate interest and after screening applicants, the finalists were selected who meet certain criteria. He assured the beneficiaries that if they diligently use the grant to improve their businesses, the firm will support them to grow into astounding success stories. One of the beneficiaries, Linda Ogana said she learned about the initiative via Mr Henry’s Instagram after losing her job in the banking sector during the pandemic.
