 The Lagos State government yesterday announced its readiness to put in place a State Electricity Policy that will serve as a blueprint for the attainment of a universal access to electricity in the State. The Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Olalere Odusote, who spoke at Alausa, Ikeja, during  the Ministerial Press Briefing to mark the Second  Anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu Administration said when the electricity policy becomes functional and fully implemented, it will also accelerate the “Light-up Lagos” power programme, which the state government had embarked upon. He said: “The Lagos Electricity Policy is vital in achieving the T.H.E.M.E.S. agenda of this administration and will serve as a key driver for the social and economic development aspirations of the State in consonance with Government’s 30-year Development Plan (2021 – 2051) being developed.”  Odusote added that the governor approved the procurement and installation of 20,000 units of prepaid energy meters for communities in the state to improve electricity supply in the affected communities. The commissioner also said the government had concluded arrangement with a leading smart metering solution company, Elsewedy Electric, on meter supply to target low income communities and also identified transmission infrastructure challenges across the State. Odusote also recalled that a programme entitled: Smart Hackathon 2020, was launched last July by Mr Governor, which he said, was to design, produce and mass-distribute affordable and reliable smart meters in Nigeria.
