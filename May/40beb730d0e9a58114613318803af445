Roberto Firmino scored twice as Liverpool boosted their hopes of finishing in the top four of the Premier League by beating Manchester United at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes curled in an early opener before Diogo Jota flicked in a clever equaliser. Firmino scored twice either side of half-time, heading home a second before tapping in a third for his side. Marcus Rashford swept in to make it 3-2 but Mohamed Salah got a late fourth. Victory means Liverpool are up to fifth and four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea with a game in hand, which is an away trip to already-relegated West Brom. BBC
