Popular Nollywood Actor Yomi Fabiyi has called on the police to release his colleague, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, aka Baba Ijesha, who was accused of molesting a minor. He demanded the release of Baba Ijesha from detention before Wednesday, May 12th, 2021 following which he will mobilise Nigerians for a protest. Fabiyi, who has been supportive of Baba Ijesha, said on his Instagram page the continuous detention of the actor without trial is a violation of his human rights. Fabiyi wrote: “PEACEFUL PROTEST on Human Rights, Illegal Detention by Police coming up on Wednesday if the Police refuse to do the right thing and grant BABA IJESHA administrative bail which is his fundamental rights. “Any progressive state and society MUST respect the RIGHTS of others as enshrined under the law. “If you refuse to be concerned now, remember it could be you. FORCEFUL ARREST, ILLEGAL IMPRISONMENT is a major tool of OPPRESSION and POLICE BRUTALITY. We must protest against this vehemently. “STAND BY WHAT IS RIGHT. #RELEASEBABAIJESHAONBAIL #SAYNOHUMANRIGHTSVIOLATION.”
