Four persons have been feared killed and many others injured in the ongoing crisis in Ikare Akoko over the Olokoja chieftaincy dispute. Chief Ogunye ldowu and Chief Sunday Bada have been fighting over the rightful Olokoja of Okoja, a village in Ikare. Both men are loyal to two warring monarchs in Ikare, the Olukare of Ikare and Owa Ale of Ikare. Chief Ogunye was dethroned as the Olokoja by Oba Akadiri Saliu Momoh, the Olukare of Ikare, for absenteeism from meetings, disloyalty, refusal to obey his directives and being loyal to the Owa Ale. The coronation of new Owa Ale, Oba Adeleke Adedoyin, is expected to take place on May 15th. Oba Momoh, in February, installed Chief Bada as the new Olokoja and attempts by Bada to call for a bi-weekly town meeting caused the recent crisis, which began on Monday. Sources in the community said several houses and vehicles have been destroyed while shootings continued as at press time. The heavy presence of security personnel did not stop the warring factions from shooting and attacking each other. It was learnt the fighting has shifted from the Olokoja village to the entire Ikare between forces loyal to the Owa Ale and Olukare. Olukare is listed as a First Class monarch while the Owa Ale is listed as Class C monarch in the State Government directory. A newspaper vendor, who gave his name as Fatai, said sporadic shootings were still going on in the central parts of the town. Fatai said business activities have been shut down as many residents stayed indoors to avoid being hit by stray bullets. He said vehicles distributing newspapers in the area could not enter the community as markets, banks, schools and motor parks were shut down Fatai stated places like Central Mosque, Post Office, Old Motor Park, Osele market and Oloko areas usually beehive of commercial activities were deserted. Sources however said the State government has intervened by inviting both parties to Akure.
