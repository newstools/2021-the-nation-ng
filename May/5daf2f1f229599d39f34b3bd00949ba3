Kano state Rugby Association’s chairman, Martins Crawford, has urged  Minister of  Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare to reverse the dissolution of Nigeria Rugby Football Federation (NRFF) to evade the eminent backwardness faced by the suspension of NRFF by Rugby Africa. Crawford said the dissolution of the board of the federation by the sports minister infringed on  the provisions of the constitution of the federation, prompting the African governing body to suspend Nigeria  from participating in all its activities. He added that the suspension of Nigeria by the rugby governing body  will depreciate its global and continental rating, a feat that may not be hurriedly  regained by the country, considering the time frame and huge talent and resources that will be required to launch Nigeria back  to its current stats. Crawford lamented that the suspension has already transmitted into unaccountable losses to Nigerian sports sector, he noted that Nigeria will not compete in the Rugby Africa Cup Repechage slated for Burkina Faso next month,  “Rugby Africa was to be responsible for all the bills from taxi fares to air tickets, hotels bills  and other logistics” Meanwhile, a member of the immediate past board of Nigeria Rugby Football Federation, NRFF, David Emeana lamented the poor handling of sports developmental and promotional issues, stressing that the economic sector of the industry has a dry future. He queried how government officers  charged with running sports affairs kept acting like bulls in a china shop,  ignoring the damages being inflicted on the  sector through their retrogressive actions.
