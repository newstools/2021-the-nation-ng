Ghanaian star actor Van Vicker has returned to the screens with his appearance as a lead cast in RedTV’s new series, Public Figure. Developed and produced in Ghana, the ‘Public Figure’ also features Dela Seade, Naa Ashorkor, Kingsley Yamoah, Benny Ashun, and Daisy Amankwah, in a story that revolves around power, marriage, politics, love, and the celebrity life. Scheduled to premiere on the RedTV’s platform on May 19, 2021, the platform’s Executive Director, Bola Atta who is also the Group Director of Communications at UBA says the choice of Ghana for the new series is a conscious step to create job opportunities in the creative industry across Africa. “We have had content from Cote D’Ivoire, Nigeria, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and a couple of other African countries and Ghana is on our road map. ‘Public figure’ was filmed in Ghana by a Ghanaian cast and crew. We will continue to create job opportunities in the creative industry across Africa,” Atta says. Atta also stressed the decision to encourage more people to explore their talents without the hesitation or fear of not being able to reach their potential in an industry that still has a huge amount of growth to do on the continent. ‘Public Figure’ joins a long list of exciting series on the UBA-owned RedTv platform that includes ‘The Men’s Club,’ ‘Our Best Friend’s Wedding,’ ‘Inspector K,’ ‘Assistant Madams,’ and ‘Hotel Boutique.’
