Foremost professor of Architecture, Professor Joseph Mgboyejugboh Igwe, has been honoured with a festschrift by the Architecture and Urbanism Research Hub, in appreciation of his forty years meritorious service to the University of Lagos (UNILAG). A book titled ‘Architecture Confluence – Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow’ was unveiled at the Julius Berger Hall, UNILAG, venue of the event. Many speakers at the event described Prof. Igwe, a seasoned scholar in architectural history, as an advocate of deep rooted cultural inputs in design conceptualization. His colleagues recalled his numerous contributions to the growth of his department, faculty as well as the entire university in his four decades of scholarly works. Speaking during the event, Prof. Igwe said; “In every sphere of our lives, architecture inclusive, we continue to make the same mistakes all year round. It is a colossal failure for an architect to design a house that the owner finds uninhabitable. It is a failure for leaders to lead a country the people find difficult to live in. We must learn to correct our mistakes using the knowledge of history as a tool. Those who do not study history suffered from a terrible type of amnesia. “We must not only take in delight in criticising, but must be ready to remember what we criticised and offer alternative ways of doing the same thing in future. That is the major path to development. Amnesia is a serious state of forgetfulness, and that is responsible for the many failures of Africans. We just don’t remember what we need to change.” Former governor of Ebonyi, Senator Sam Egwu, who chaired the event, described the book as a big honoured done Prof. Igwe in recognition of his many feats in the academia and architecture. He recommended the book for all, including professionals in architecture and history. Others at the event were Professor Igwe’s colleagues within and outside the University, as well as many of his mentees.
