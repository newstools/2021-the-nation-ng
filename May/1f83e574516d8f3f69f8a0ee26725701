A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Samaritan Mission to Africa (SMTA), has donated food items to 300 people in Ikorodu, Lagos. The food items include Rice, Garri, Onions, Groundnut oil, Chicken and bread. SMTA Lagos/Ogun state branch Coordinator, Mr Olarewaju Olufunmi, said the gesture was to make life easier for the beneficiaries. “Our target is to see how we can assist as many people as we can; you know you cannot satisfy all. What we are planning to achieve is to assist Africans when it comes to feeding and health care. We know everybody cannot afford regular meal and good medical care but anyone that SMTA can help, we will be glad to do as much as possible, that’s where we are now,” he said. He urged people to take their health issue serious, saying “Government cannot do it all; you’re the only one that can help yourself. The government can only try with the limited resources available. Look out for any legal means of income to sustain your family,” he advised.
