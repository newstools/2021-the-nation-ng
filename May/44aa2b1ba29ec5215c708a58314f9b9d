South Korea government has said it will expand the Nigeria – Korea Model School to six states to enhance education in the country. The Korean government already operates a $15 million dollars model school in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja through its agency – Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). KOICA is the agency responsible for the administration of aid programs for developing countries. The Republic of South Korea Ambassador to Nigeria, Kim Young-chae, said this in an interview with reporters to mark his 100 days in office. The envoy said KOICA is in touch with state authorities on how to implement the school project in the states. He said: “The Korean government spent $15 million dollars on the Nigeria – Korea Model School along airport road. It is not a small amount of money. “The Korean government provided the facilities for the school. The teacher quality is very high. “KOICA is trying to replicate the school in six states. They (KOICA) are in contact with state authorities to handle the project. “We are not building the school itself but we are going to provide equipment like computers, LCD screens and other ICT – related equipment. “The funding will be lower than the one in Abuja because we are having six states.”
