Leader of Oyo caucus in the House of Representatives, Hon Segun Odebunmi, has congratulated All Progressives Congress (APC) and ALGON on their well-deserved victory at the Supreme Court dissolution of council chairmen and councillors by Governor Seyi Makinde. Odebunmi who is also the Chairman House Committee on Information, National Orientation  Ethics and Values, described the judgement as victory for democracy and its adherents. The member representing Ogo-Oluwa/Surulere Federal constituency noted it is unhealthy for elected council chairmen to be dissolved. He applauded the resilience of ALGON under the headship of Hon. Abass Alesinloye all through the legal tussle. He observed that Friday’s Judgement will further strengthen the administration of local government in Nigeria and enrich the related jurisprudence. He advised everyone in authority to always act within the dictate of law rather than engaging in action that could cause anarchy.
