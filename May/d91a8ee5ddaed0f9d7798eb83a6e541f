Stakeholders in the maritime industry have stressed the importance of human factors to shipping. The stakeholders, who spoke with The Nation, said seafarers who move cargoes across the globe, need attention and protection by their employers. A stakeholder, Mr Kehinde Adefeji, said:”Employees are the most critical factor that determine the success of a firm. This is even truer in the maritime industry that is capital intensive and where safety is paramount, so constant training and development as well as welfare of workforce must be taken seriously.” Another stakeholder, Mr Aladejobi Ibrahim, urged African businessmen to pay great attention to workers’ welfare to compete favourably in the international market. He commended the International Labour Organisation (ILO) for the review of Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 2006 and advised that considerations should be given to peculiarities of the various geo-political areas of the world in the amendments of laws governing industry.
