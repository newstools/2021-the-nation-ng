Bauchi Emirate Council has suspended a member representing Bauchi Federal Constituency, Yakubu Abdullahi, who holds the traditional title of Wakilin Birnin Bauchi for allegedly disrespecting Emir of Bauchi, Dr Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu. The indefinite suspension was contained in a letter dated May 16, 2021, by Nasiru Musa Maidala, Secretary of the Emirate. According to the letter, the suspension became necessary considering some “unbecoming behaviour” of the lawmaker, which amounted to disrespect to the Emir of Bauchi, District, and village heads as well as other traditional title holders in the Emirate. The letter specifically made reference to an event at the Government House on Sunday during the annual Sallah Hawan Daushe held to pay homage to the Governor by the Emir of Bauchi and all the traditional rulers in the Emirate. The Emirate Council, which faulted his mode of dressing in the presence of the Emir, district and village heads as well as other traditional title holders, viewed it as grave misconduct and disrespect to constituted authorities. The letter reads: “After thorough deliberation by the Emirate Council on your actions which are disrespectful to the Emir of Bauchi, Dr Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu, you are hereby suspended as the Wakilin Birnin Bauchi indefinitely until further notice.” All attempts to get a reaction of the Wakilin Birnin Bauchi proved abortive as at press time.
