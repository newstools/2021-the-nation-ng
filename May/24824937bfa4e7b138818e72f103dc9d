 A woman, Olanshile Nasirudeen has been apprehended by police for stabbing her husband to death in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State. Olanshile, 47, who is a butcher, was said to have attacked her husband at the abattoir, where he also worked as a butcher, severing a vein in his body. The man was rushed to hospital but died while receiving treatment after losing much blood. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement yesterday, said the suspect was arrested following a distress call placed to the Divisional Police Headquarters, Ijebu Ode. Abimbola said an expectant mother’s visit to the deceased at the abattoir led to a heated argument between the suspect and the deceased.  “The suspect who is a co-butcher with the deceased, sighted a woman whom her husband recently impregnated at the abattoir, and she started questioning the woman about her audacity to get pregnant for her husband. “This led to a hot argument between her and the deceased, and as a result, the suspect picked a knife and stabbed the deceased in the left leg, cutting one of his veins. “He was quickly rushed to a nearby hospital for first aid, and later transferred to Ijebu Ode General Hospital where he eventually gave up the ghost while receiving treatment, due to excessive bleeding,” Abimbola said. Abimbola said the suspect was fourth wife to the deceased, whose remains have been released to the family for burial.
