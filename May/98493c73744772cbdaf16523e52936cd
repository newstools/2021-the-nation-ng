Barcelona are reportedly confident that Lionel Messi will sign a new deal to stay with the club, after his participation with Argentina at the Copa America. The 33-year-old is currently training with his national side, who are to host the tournament which kicks off on June 13 with a game in Buenos Aires against Chile. Messi is aware that the Catalan club could face a Champions League ban from UEFA, following their persistence to remain in the European Super League. However, according to the Daily Mail, Barcelona still expect the six-time Ballon d’Or winner to put pen to paper on a new deal, even if they are not competing in Europe’s elite competition next season. Barca also believe that the potential arrival of Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero, who is a close friend of Messi, can help persuade him to stay.
