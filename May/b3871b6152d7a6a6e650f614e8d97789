Kelechi Iheanacho had made one league start before Christmas. When January ended, he had more penalty misses (one) than goals (none) in the top flight. He finished February with a solitary league goal. And he goes into the FA Cup final as the hottest forward in the country. It is a remarkable transformation. Iheanacho has 10 goals in 11 league matches, 15 in 17 in all competitions. He was Leicesterâ€™s match-winner in the FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester United and then the semi-final versus Southampton. If Leicester belatedly lifts the FA Cup, 128 years after first entering it, Iheanacho may be the player of the competition. It would make him a Leicester legend.  He has not been as potent since he scored six goals and registered seven assists in the 2013 Under-17 World Cup; unsurprisingly, he was named the player of the tournament. Now he may be the player of the last third of the Premier League. Since Iheanacho sprang to life with a fine equaliser against Burnley in March, he has 10 goals and two assists. He is the most productive player in that time. He is two clear at the top of the scoring charts and, if assists are factored in, one ahead of Chris Wood. The statistics since then underline his two great strengths: he is often an excellent finisher and he gets into goal scoring positions. Those 10 goals come from an expected goals of 6.73; in over performing his expected goals by 3.27 over 10 weeks, he ranks second only to Gareth Bale, who has bettered his by 5.09.
