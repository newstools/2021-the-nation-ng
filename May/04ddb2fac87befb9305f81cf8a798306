  A man whose son was gunned by suspected land grabbers has called on the Ogun State government and security agencies to find the killers and bring them to justice. Bidemi Akinde, an aspiring law student, was shot dead in August 2015 in Oke-Ore community in Ado-Odo-Ota Local Government Area of the state. Bidemi’s father, Rotimi said his son’s soul will not rest until his killers pay for their crime. Rotimi said the killing was reported to police which he said was lethargic in handling it.  He said fresh facts have emerged from witnesses whose account of the incident would help shed more light on the suspects in connecting with the murder of his son, hence the need for the police to reopen the case. According to him, the alleged shoddy manner the case was treated initially provided room for the suspects in the murder case to evade prosecution. Bidemi Akinde was 18 years old when he was gunned down.
