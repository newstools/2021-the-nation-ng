Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, yesterday inaugurated a nine -man committee to give policy direction to the implementation of the State COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (CARES) programme designed to support livelihood of the poor and vulnerable households in the state. The State CARES is a jointly developed World Bank-supported programme aimed at mitigating the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the socio-economic well-being of the people. While inaugurating members of the committee in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital to mark the formal activation of the CARES programme, Governor Fayemi explained that the programme would also support budgeted state government interventions for farmers, artisans, Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) affected by the economic crisis occasioned by the pandemic. The Steering Committee which is chaired by the Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Femi Ajayi, according to the Governor, will work out modalities that would enable the state to benefit maximally from the World Bank’s COVID-19 intervention programme. “It is also saddled with the responsibilities of supervising the coordination and delivery system to scale up the emergency support; regulating guidelines to support effectiveness and sustainability of livelihood and food security activities; capacity building and any other necessary measures to enable the state to achieve the Eleven Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIS),” he said. The Governor urged the members of the committee to display deep commitment, experience, prudence, transparency and technical expertise that would guarantee a fruitful partnership that can be strengthened and sustained. Governor Feyemi, who also highlighted how the lockdown and other strict measures enforced to curtail the spread of the pandemic practically affected global socio-economic activities said the CARES programme was part of efforts by the Federal Government, in collaboration with World Bank and the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) to address the debilitating effect of the pandemic on the most vulnerable sector of the country. He said the implementation of the programme will not only allow state governments to enhance the delivery of social safety net, assistance and basic service to the people but also increase food security and supply chain as well as facilitate recovery of household and micro-enterprises from total economic collapse.
