Nigerians on social media have condemned the gruesome killings, violent attacks in Benue State by suspected herders and gunmen. The Nation reports that Benue has recorded continuous attacks on its communities by gunmen in the past few weeks. Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom had urged the people of the state to obtain Dane gun licences from local government areas for self-defence. “I’ll no longer announce the deaths of those killed by Fulani herdsmen, rise up and defend yourselves with weapons not prohibited by law, bows and arrows, spears and knives. Get licence for dane guns from local government Chairmen and use them to defend yourselves,” he said. Trending with the hashtag #BenueUnderAttack with over 100,000 tweets, many bemoaned the spate of killings across the state. The Nation learnt there was anxiety over the alleged killing of some people in Katsina Ala LGA of the state which has rendered many homeless. While reports of the number of those allegedly killed have varied, many Nigerians called the attention of authorities to gory images as evidence of mass killings. Nigerians also called on security agencies to re-double their efforts to bring an end to the mindless violent crimes where lives are taken without any consideration. Reacting, an ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri posited that “Except Benue gets their own Sunday Igboho; these almost daily attacks that have characterised #BenueUnderAttack will continue to happen. If Benue people clash with cows, General @MBuhari will ALWAYS side with cows. Benue needs an Igboho that will side with them #TableShaker” Co-convener of the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) movement, Aisha Yesufu said “The lives of Benue people must be protected. No Nigerian is more Nigerian than any Nigerian. #BenueUnderAttack” Nollywood Actress, Kate Henshaw lamented that “Much as I am trying to focus on other things. The images of bodies lain on the floor in huge numbers has dampened my spirit somewhat. Why does life mean nothing in Nigeria? To our rulers?? Too much blood shed….too much #BenueUnderAttack.” Another commentator, FS Yusuf said “Ortom needs to know that terrorists have opened a war on his people and he has to prepare his people to fight and protect themselves. Make we forget all the English wey we dey speak here. All of us dey mad! They are killing innocent Christians in Benue State #BenueUnderAttack” “We can’t fold our hands and watch anymore. #BenueUnderAttack. People are being killed in their homes and lands and the government is watching. This is a ticking time bomb. Protect all Nigerian citizens!” Aproko Doctor lamented.
