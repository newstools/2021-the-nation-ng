Lagos State House of Assembly on Tuesday read for the second time a Bill to establish the Lagos State Legislative and Research Institute. The Bill, which is a Private Member Bill, is given much laud by members of the House as a Bill that will formalise the sharing of knowledge across the scope, national and international. Speaker Mudashiru Obasa said the bill is an incubator hatched for an efficient and effective legislative institute in the state, supporting that the issue of the council men who are abandoned without given the opportunity to perform their functions as legislators due to lack of knowledge will be avoided as that is what the institution will stand for. “This Bill is viable to us and also for other legislatures in service of the parliament and other states can share in it as the centre will be a learning space for councillors and local government chairmen, promoting and deepening democracy in our state. “The institute will also engage international legislative bodies such as African Parliamentary Union where we can acquire more knowledge through the centre,” he said
