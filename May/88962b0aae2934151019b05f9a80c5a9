The Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) has stated that it has not made any university a first choice for prospective beneficiaries of its scholarship programme. The clarification became necessary following a notice circulating on social media claiming that the Amnesty Office’s new education policy mandated prospective candidates to make University of Africa, Toru-Orua, their first choice when applying for the PAP scholarship to qualify for the scheme. Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (rtd), the Interim Administrator, Presidential Amnesty Programme in a statement signed by his SA Media Nneotaobase Egbe, debunked the reports that originated not only from the University of Africa, but also from other universities. The administrator insisted that there was no time PAP chose one university or restricted its scholarship programme to only universities within the Niger Delta region. He, however, reiterated that for academic excellence required for the development of Niger Delta especially in the area of manpower development and capacity building, one of the criteria for PAP scholarship was that prospective beneficiaries must first enroll and pass the examination offered by the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB). He also said that the candidate must be an ex-agitator captured in the programme’s database or come from one of the Niger Delta crises-impacted communities and must have at least five credit in (WAEC/NECO) including English and Mathematics. He said that applications submitted would be subjected to background verifications and candidates would go through a pre-qualification screening before being considered for scholarship. He also said that beneficiaries, who failed to meet the qualification for formal education, would be advised to consider vocational training instead. Dikio said another condition was that prospective candidates must also apply for courses that would enhance the comparative advantage to the region.
