Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has said that his side are on a downward trend and that there were reasons behind that decline he could not explain in public after crashing out of the Europa League. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, Arsenal drew 0-0 at Emirates Stadium as captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit the post with a late header, but the end result was a new low that continues a slide from being Champions League regulars under Arsene Wenger. “I understand [fans’] concerns because when you are out of the Champions League for five years it is not just a casualty, it’s a trend,” he said.  “There are facts to support that trend. So, there are things to change, that’s for sure because you know no one is going to accept that at this football club. I am not going to accept that, and the fans are not going to accept that. So we all have to push together to achieve something very different.” Asked why that trend was occurring, Arteta replied: “They are things to analyse more internally, I am sorry. We have done that. There are things that we cannot discuss here. I take full responsibility for my part, for sure, since I arrived here what I have tried to do, giving my life, my best ability, investing every drop of energy that I have emotionally to support everything that has been going around with my knowledge, with staff, with all the players that are trying to contribute with all the club to give our best.
