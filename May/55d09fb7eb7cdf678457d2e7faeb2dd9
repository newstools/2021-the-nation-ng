Music couple Simi and Adekunle Gold has revealed the identity of their first child, a daughter. The Nation reports the couple tied the knots at a private ceremony in Lagos, in December 2019. In 2020, they welcomed their first child, Adejare. Many fans wondered why the couple had hid the baby’s face from the public but Simi, during a question and answer session, said “the little girl deserves her privacy.” Celebrating the one year anniversary of their daughter, they took to their separate Instagram pages to pen glowing messages. Adekunle wrote: “To the most beautiful one-year-old-little girl I have ever known, You have graced our lives for a whole year now. “You bring us so much joy and everyday I am grateful for you. I dunno how, but there’s no getting use to how perfect you are. Happy Birthday Adejare. Daddy loves you so much Deji!” Simi, in her long message, said: “Blessed fruit of my womb. Drinker of my milk. Climber of my body. Sleep stopper. Scatterer of my things. Best dancer. Blessing bringer,”  “Lil Miss I-have-a-mind-of-my-own. Overall best in eating paper. Cheerful Giver even when I don’t want. Beauty Queen. My little butterfly. My Child. Omo mi. Ayanfe mi. Onife mi. Love of my life. I love you so much Adejare. So much. “You make me so proud of myself. I would do anything for you. Everything. For you. You will never doubt that no one in the world could possibly love you like I do. Sometimes I will do too much, but it will be because I love you too much. “As I write this, I’m watching you watch some baby show and Déjà – E CHOKE!!! Literally choking with love for you my girl. I wanna cry because Ayo mi, you make me so happy. I’m so blessed to know you and have you in my life.
