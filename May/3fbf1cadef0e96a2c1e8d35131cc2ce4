 Crystal Palace are safe for another season as goals from Christian Benteke and Eberechi Eze downed Sheffield United 2-0 to confirm the Eagles’ Premier League survival. Following a run of three straight League defeats, the win at Bramall Lane means Palace will be playing top-flight football next season as the club faces a potential summer of upheaval. The visitors took the lead in the second minute when Eze carved the Blades open with a mazy run and slid the ball to Benteke, whose effort bounced off George Baldock and dribbled over the line. Eze then doubled Palace’s advantage in the 88th minute, gliding past several challenges before firing a goal-bound effort that took a massive deflection off John Fleck and wrong footed Aaron Ramsdale. The win lifted Roy Hodgson’s side to 13th on 41 points, 14 points clear of the relegation zone with four games to play. The Blades remain rooted to the bottom of the table with 17 points.
