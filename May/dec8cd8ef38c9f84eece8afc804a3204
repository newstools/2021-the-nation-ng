The Plateau State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and the not-for-profit organisation, Universal Learning Solutions (ULS), are working in partnership to deliver intensive training to the teachers and government officials under the Teacher Professional Development initiative. Training for 2,625 primary school teachers and 50 officials from 17 Local Governments Areas spanned two weeks across six training centres. For three days in each centre, the participants were exposed to the specialist literacy teaching practices called ‘Jolly Phonics’. With the training, teachers gain the expertise to teach early child classes and Primary one, two and three pupils in public schools the rudiments of literacy. Mr Patrick Uzu, Nigeria Country Director, ULS, said Jolly Phonics is a fun and interactive teaching tool that uses the synthetic phonics literacy teaching methodology. Synthetic phonics is mandated or recommended by governments around the world because of the way that it quickly provides children with the skills needed to read and write. ULS CEO, Mr Gary Foxcroft said the initiative, which is in its fifth year in Plateau State, had grown. “The Plateau State Jolly Phonics is a fantastic opportunity for all children in Plateau State to benefit from the opportunity to learn to read and write. The project will, therefore, help increase equity and equal opportunities for all children in Plateau State.” Foxcroft also praised the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) for its continued support for the adoption of Jolly Phonics in government schools across Nigeria.
