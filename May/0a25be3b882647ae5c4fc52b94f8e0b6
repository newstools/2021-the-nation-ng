 Pep Guardiola’s father has declared his excitement at the prospect of Man City winning the Champions League – and beating Real Madrid in the final. City hold a 2-1 aggregate lead over Paris Saint-Germain ahead of the second leg on Tuesday evening, and are seen by many as the favourites to lift the trophy. “Beating Real Madrid would be a complete dream,” Valentí Guardiola told Israeli sports channel ‘Sports 5’ ahead of the second leg. “If {Manchester City} play against Real Madrid, I hope they win the trophy. Guardiola commented on whether his son is the greatest coach in football history. “Well, I am his father and I do not want to boast,” he said. “Johan Cruyff was also very good but each coach has their own personality. “I do know one thing: Pep does not sleep before a match. He analyses everything.” He went on to reveal that he does not believe that his son will return to Barcelona as coach but believes that he will still remain in football.
