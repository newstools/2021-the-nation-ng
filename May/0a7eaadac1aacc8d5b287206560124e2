The season may have ended but Leicester cannot but captured the numbers behind Kelechi Iheanacho’s remarkable campaign, as the forward helped Leicester City to cup glory and league successes. According to Leicester, Iheanacho’s five goals in his last three league games was certainly a notable record and a further two in the FA Cup seven days later made it seven in four games in all competitions. After picking up the Premier League’s EA Sports Player of the Month award in March, he was also in the running for the same award in April after netting four top-flight goals during the month. After signing a new contract on April 3, 2021, which will keep him at the Football Club until at least 2024, two second-half strikes away at West Ham United almost drew the Foxes level at London Stadium, while the third goal of a scintillating first-half display against West Bromwich Albion sealed back-to-back successes after the FA Cup Semi-Final triumph. An even more telling contribution came in the next home Premier League fixture, versus Crystal Palace, which on a personal level, capped off a superb run of 12 goals in nine games. With the score locked at 1-1 heading into the final 10 minutes, Jonny Evans played the ball into Iheanacho’s path and he leathered a sweet, left-footed strike into the roof of the net to snatch all three points. It was a strike that would be nominated for the Premier League’s Budweiser Goal of the Month award and later win Goal of the Season in the Club’s End of Season Awards.
