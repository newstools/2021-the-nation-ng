Small scale indigenous manufacturers are ramping up operations to grow their share of the chocolate market from less than one per cent to about five per cent. This comes against the background of continuing increase in consumer demand for chocolate products. Chief Operating Officer, Centre for Cocoa Development Initiative Inc, Adhuze Robo, said there were   efforts to launch more small-scale chocolate manufacturing outfits to help the food industry meet growing demand for chocolates. He noted that the need for increased processing has come under pressure as cocoa prices showed signs of volatility. According to him, steadfast farmers and eager entrepreneurs have been working to reinvigorate cocoa farming and processing. He noted, however, that though the local chocolate industry is not having its golden moment yet, there is a consumer interest that will support the industry’s upward trajectory. He pointed out that the farmers do not only have the challenge of high quality seedlings to plant but also lack of steady transfer of knowledge of more competitive and sustainable agricultural production practices. He urged producers to exploit the growing trend towards high-quality chocolate consumption. President, Federation of Agricultural Commodity Association of Nigeria (FACAN),Dr Victor Iyama said increased local processing of cocoa beans to chocolate would improve the  income of cocoa farmers and create new jobs, which would help address poverty and employment issues. He called for the diversification of the destination of cocoa exports for the production of its high-end brands. He argued that there is, nonetheless, great potential still for cocoa production in Nigeria. According to him, given the size of the domestic market, Nigeria has significant potential for expansion. At the moment, smaller local manufacturers faced great competition from multinational manufacturers such as Cadbury Nigeria.
