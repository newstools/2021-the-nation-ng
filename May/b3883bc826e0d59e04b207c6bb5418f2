 God has given us  specific gifts to share. It is one thing to identify your gifts, it is another thing to utilise them. There are differences between talents and gifts. Talents are natural while gifts are supernatural. They come through inheritance and maybe  genes, while gifts are  from the Lord. Talents  need to be developed while gifts  are to be exercised and that can only be exercised by a believer; someone who believes in the dwelling of God. The purpose of life is to utilise your gifts for the betterment of humanity. What you should  aim to do in your life is to transfer your possession willingly without seeking benefits in return from an individual. Using  your gifts without restrictions enables you to have impact on humans. Everybody has  specific gifts  on earth; it is only left for people to discover such at the right time God has given everyone  unique ability, talents and gifts. A spiritual gift is an endowment from the Holy Spirit. Spiritual gifts are like loans. You have been given  spiritual gifts freely, your duty is to use to better the lot of people. The meaning of life is find your gifts while the purpose of life is to properly utilise them. For you to discover your gifts, you need to seek the face of God. This is by praying, while praying, ask him to show you your purpose  on earth. If God shows you, it is not for you to keep.  It is left for you as an individual to exercise it and utilise it effectively.
