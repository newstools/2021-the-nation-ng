 FAST-RISING act, Adams Olabode aka Smada, has picked ‘She broke my heart,’ as the favourite of all his songs. The Kilonso co-singer laid it bare in a chat with The Nation while talking about himself and his music career. Smada reminisced on how his brother had influenced his incursion into music saying, “I remember it being my brother. He used to make music and I was like his drummer boy until someday he asked me to try freestyling and then boom. The rest is history.”  He described his kind of music as all genres due to his ability to infuse his sound into any sound. On collaboration, Smada says, “I would love to collaborate with a lot of people that want to collaborate with me, rising acts as well and also some big guns in the game.”
