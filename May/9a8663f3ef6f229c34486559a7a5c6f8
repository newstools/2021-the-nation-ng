The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged Nigerians to use the occasion of the Eid-el-Fitr, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan as opportunity to unite in confronting the challenges facing the nation. In a statement on Wednesday by spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party stressed that the virtues of self-sacrifice, love, perseverance and inner peace embodied in the lessons of the holy month of Ramadan should continue to guide Nigerians as a people to face and overcome the challenges of life, particularly the evils confronting the nation today. “As a people, we are faced by all sorts of new surge in terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, vandalism; recklessness and insensitivity in governance as well as the menace of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Indeed, this is the time for Nigerians to keep hope alive believing that with trust in God and unity of all, this ugly phase in the life of our nation will surely pass,” the party said. The PDP urged Nigerians to also use the occasion to pray for the nation as well as show love to one another, especially the downtrodden and the victims of the scourge of terrorism and banditry in the country. While wishing Nigerian a pleasant Eid-el-Fitr celebrations, the party also charged the citizenry to remain vigilant and continue to keep their trust in God’s infinite mercy at this critical time.
