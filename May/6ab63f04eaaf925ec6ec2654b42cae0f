Deontay Wilder has warned revenge will be sweet when he takes on Tyson Fury in their trilogy fight this summer. Wilder’s successful legal case to enforce a third meeting with Fury has this week scuppered plans for the all-British unification showdown between Fury and Anthony Joshua. ‘The Bronze Bomber’ is now expected to get his opportunity to reclaim his WBC belt at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on 24 July – with WBO mandatory challenger Olesksandr Usyk in talks to fight Joshua in August.  Fury’s co-promoter Frank Warren suggested earlier this week it could cost as much as €20m to get Wilder to step aside and allow Joshua vs Fury to take place as planned on 14 August in Saudi Arabia. Wilder’s new trainer Malik Scott later revealed the former champion ‘wants the blood not that step-aside money’. Wilder has now echoed those sentiments with all signs suggesting the third fight is on.
