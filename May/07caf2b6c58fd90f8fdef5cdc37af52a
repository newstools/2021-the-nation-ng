 COMPOSER, singer and performer, Patrick Osagie Osakwe aka P. Voo has dumped secular music for gospel pop. P.Voo maintained that God asked him to embrace for the salvation of his soul saying, “I must give my career and existence meaning by glorifying my God who created me for a purpose in life, of which serving him in whatever capacity is utmost.” The transformed entertainer, who may end up on the pulpit, said that he is toeing gospel pop music among other reasons to disprove critics that believe his career will nose-dive.  “As long as God is the creator of heaven and earth and He remains on the throne, my newfound genre which is meant to edify God will not only become a commercial success but a spiritual plus for my life and living in Jesus name”, he contended. P.Voo hit the limelight with “Turn Around” years back and made a grand re-entry last year with another potential hit “Scam” before dumping secular music for a gospel brand. He also said he’s determined to ensure that no label owner discourages him from doing the gospel genre, hence, the launch of a new label, P.Voo World.
