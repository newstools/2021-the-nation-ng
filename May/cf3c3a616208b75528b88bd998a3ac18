  Security operatives have arrested one of the wanted leaders of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) Awurum Eze, believed to have masterminded the recent killings in Imo State, the Nigerian Army has said. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) henchman, according to a statement by the Director Army Public Relations Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, is the second in command to the late ESN Commander, Ikonso, who was killed by troops a fortnight ago. The statement said Eze is one of the few members with direct link to IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu. “The 48-year-old Awurum Eze, a native of Umoneke Nta, Isiala-Mbano LGA, Imo State, had on May 4, 2021 escaped when operatives of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) stormed his village house in Isiala Mbano where he was hiding.  “He was eventually apprehended on Wednesday, May 12, 2022, in Aba. “Awurum Eze is one of the main sponsors of the numerous killings in Imo State and has been on the wanted list of security agents for more than three months,” the statement said. Many of the arrested IPOB /ESN terrorists had earlier mentioned him as their key sponsor, mastermind and Second in Command to late Ikonso. “According to them, amongst all their leaders in Imo State, only Ikonso and Awurum have direct communication link with Nnamdi Kanu. He can be seen in several photographs posing with the fugitive terrorist leader, Nnamdi Kanu. “Investigation by the combined team of security operatives continues”.
