The Nigeria’s electricity transmission system, also known as the National grid, has suffered another system collapse, plunging Lagos, country’s commercial capital, Kano and other major cities into blackout. The collapse, which occurred about 11.00 am yesterday, was confirmed by two of the country’s electricity distribution companies in separate messages to their customers. “We regret to inform you that the power outage being experienced across our franchise – Kaduna, Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states – is as a result of the collapse of the national grid,” Kaduna Electric said on Twitter. Eko Electricity Distribution Company Plc, in a text message to its customers, said: “Dear customer, there is a partial system collapse on the national grid. Our TCN partners are working to restore supply immediately. Please bear with us.” The grid, which is being managed by government-owned Transmission Company of Nigeria, has continued to suffer system collapse over the years amid a lack of spinning reserve that is meant to forestall such occurrences. Spinning reserve is the generation capacity that is online but unloaded and that can respond within 10 minutes to compensate for generation or transmission outages.
