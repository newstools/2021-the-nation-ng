The Director General, National Council for Arts and Culture and President World Crafts Council, Segun Runsewe, is thrilled with the way the entire Leicester team danced to a Nigerian song after winning the English FA Cup last weekend at Wembley. In the dressing room of the Brendan Rodgers-tutored side shortly after lifting the cup, the song of Nigerian singer, Dr. Kid “Over the moon” rented the air with Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi leading other players from various other countries to dance. Runsewe said there was need to document, institutionalize and legalise the legacy of Iheanacho and Ndidi as a show of extreme love and indivisibility of Nigeria their country. Runsewe said he is prompted to put up a request for artistic impression of their actions on that day. He added for those who appreciate the culture of the country that moment was magical and the two players deserved huge commendation. “After making the country proud on the pitch, they went ahead to sell our culture to the world in a special way in the dressing room. The song was a Nigerian song and our players made their other colleagues to dance to it. That was remarkable.”
