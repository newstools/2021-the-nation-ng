With plans to commence operations from its Lagos base at the General Aviation Terminal (GAT), she said the carrier will launch flights to   connect seven cities after completing its ongoing Air Operator Certificate (AOC) process with the NCAA which is now in advanced stages. According to Osobajo, additional cities within Nigeria will be added as the value carrier scales its operations. She said plans were underway to establish two more operational bases outside Lagos to stimulate air travel and provide more options to customers. Osobajo said: “To facilitate increased economic and trade activities within Nigeria, Green Africa will offer new direct connections from the commercial hub of Lagos into these cities including Akure, Ilorin, Abuja, Enugu , Owerri and Port Harcourt .” Its Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Babawande Afolabi said starting with “our launch route network, we are crafting a network plan that will afford more customers the opportunity to pursue their economic interest or simply spend more time with family and friends. Our three key product offerings – gSaver, gClassicTM and gFlexTM will afford customers the value of choice and flexibility. “Green Africa recently received its first aircraft with the second and third aircraft expected to arrive soon. Facilities and infrastructures are now in place to support commercial, flight, and airport operations.”
