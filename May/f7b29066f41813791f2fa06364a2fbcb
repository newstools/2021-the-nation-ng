Super Eagles winger Samuel Chukwueze has handed Villarreal a major boost ahead of their Europa League final clash against Manchester United on Wednesday. The Nigeria  international has not featured for the Yellow Submarines since he picked up an injury in the second leg of the Europa League semifinal against Arsenal. Chukwueze sustained a suspected groin injury in the 29 minutes and was and was replaced by 18-year-old Yeremi Pino. The injury was expected to keep him out for a month, which would’ve ruled him out of the showpiece against the Red Devils next week. However, the 21-year-old  was pictured in training on Thursday morning with the rest of the Villarreal team. He also shared some pictures of himself in training on his Instagram stories. The forward  also participated in the club’s Media Day event on Wednesday as part of the activities line up ahead of the final next week. Chukwueze’s return to training comes after Villarreal manager Unai Emery revealed he’s a doubt for the league clash against Real Madrid on Saturday. Chukwueze has registered five assists and score one goal in the Europa League this season.
