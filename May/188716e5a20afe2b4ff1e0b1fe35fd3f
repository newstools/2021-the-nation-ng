Popular micro-blogging platform, Twitter on Wednesday, May 5, 2021, officially endorsed DMW Boss, Davido’s “E choke” slang with the introduction of an Emoji. 30BG Boss, Davido, is not only known for dropping steady hits and bangers but has proven time and time again to be a trendsetter and major social media influencer.
