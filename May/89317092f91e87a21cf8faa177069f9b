 It might be easier for the camel to pass through the eyes of the needles than to make the Super Eagles list for the upcoming FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 qualifiers if the words of Coach Gernot Rohr are anything to go by. Though the 67-year-old former Bayern Munich defender had  said repeatedly he was spoilt for choice  with many of the Super Eagles stars in the best  form  of their lives in their respective European sides, while affirming that  players to be so selected for the forthcoming international matches will be based on serious scouting and monitoring. “We are preparing our list with a lot of scouting and monitoring,” Rohr told NationSport yesterday.  The Super Eagles will begin their long campaign towards a place in the first FIFA World Cup to be hosted in the Middle East with a home match against the Lone Star of Liberia  on the  weekend of June 5 to 8 while they travel away to Cape Verde on  the weekend of June 11 to 14. Rohr said he was hopeful  that the match  would go ahead as planned given the prevailing circumstances as per COVID -17, adding  that he would this  weekend visit a Super Eagles star who recently bounced back to match fitness. “I will travel the weekend to meet one player coming back from injury,” Rohr said further without disclosing the particular player. “We hope that our matches in June will be played,” added Rohr.
