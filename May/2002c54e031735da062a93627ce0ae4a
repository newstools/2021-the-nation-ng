 The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) has debunked reports that some pensioners  have been left out of the consequential pension adjustment approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. Its Executive Secretary, Dr. Chioma Ejikeme, in a statement, explained: “We would like to state emphatically that Mr. President’s approval under reference covers all pensioners under the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS), including parastatal pensioners, who constitute the membership of FEPPAN, and does not discriminate against any category of pensioners. “For the avoidance of doubt, the Directorate has already computed the entitlements of all its pensioners and will commence the immediate implementation of the consequential increment as approved by Mr. President. “This, therefore, renders any call of potential engagement of any Federal Government agency by FEPPAN irrelevant as all its members are covered under the DBS umbrella as stated in the circular released by the National Salaries Wages and Incomes Commission (NSWIC).” Ejikeme appealed to the leadership of pension unions to avail themselves of the freedom of information offered by the Directorate to avoid the  misconception of government policies.
