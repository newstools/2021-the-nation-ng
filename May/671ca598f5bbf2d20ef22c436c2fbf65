Singer Opeyemi Babatunde Rahim also known as Lyta has been called out by his baby mama over his failure to provide money for his son’s birthday party.⁣ Kemi Ayorinde, mother of Lyta’s son made this known via her Instagram Stories while writing a note to her future husband.⁣ Ayorinde noted she is crying out because of the N13k, stating that the singer has been selfish and she asked him for the money so as to get him involved in their child’s life. She said: “I asked him to provide money for balloons cause as much as I dislike him and his selfish ways, I wanted him to feel involved in his child’s life even in the littlest ways but he’s not ready to do nothing. My father was useless too but not to this level and my son will never be. “And p.s I ain’t dating no broke nigga again, most of my relationships I’ve been the moneymaker, treating and spending on their ungrateful ass’s. I’ve dated a rich guy before so I know how things should be. And yes I said what I said, make everybody gettat. “Dear future husband, Aari’s dad can’t afford 13k (Naira) for balloons for his child’s upcoming 1st birthday so imma need you to be able to afford my baby’s monthly cost, If not you’re not for me.” The singer and Ayorinde welcomed Aari in 2020.⁣ Lyta is yet to react to his baby mama’s claims.⁣
