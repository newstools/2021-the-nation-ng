  A man in Rivers State has beaten his wife to death one month after she was delivered of a baby. Police said the incident happened in Bonny, an island community. The nursing mother identified simply as Chioma was said to be routinely beaten by her spouse, only this time the assault turned fatal as she did not recover. Divisional Police Officer (DPO) James Ekpeta confirmed the incident to a blogger on the Island, “Christina Reports,” via a telephone on Sunday, saying they were investigating the whereabouts of the body of the deceased and the suspect. The incident reportedly happened last weekend in Ayambo, an island community in Bonny Local Government Area.  The victim and the suspect were said to be live-in lovers. She was said to be constantly abused by the man while they cohabited. However, despite giving birth to a baby recently, and her health fragile,  she was still abused by the suspect. The man last weekend beat her again, believing  it would be business as usual, but she died on the spot, it was said. Efforts to reach the spokesman of the state police command, Nnamdi Omoni, a Superintendent of Police as at the time of filing this report,  for clearer information on the killing proved abortive. He did not answer the several calls placed to his mobile phone, neither   did he return any of the calls.
