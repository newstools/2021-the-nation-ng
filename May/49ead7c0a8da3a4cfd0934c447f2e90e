The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) has unveiled a website for the local government elections slated for July 24. The Chairman of the commission, Justice Ayotunde Phillips (rtd), said the website is faster, more secure, easier to navigate and user-friendly. This, she said, would further boost communication between the commission and its stakeholders in the public, “particularly at this crucial period of election preparations.” She urged the public to visit the website: www.lasiec.gov.ng and other social media handles of the commission for up-to-date, real-time and accurate information. According to her, enquiries, complaints and feedback can also be communicated via these channels.
