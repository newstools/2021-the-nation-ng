Former national chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) Sen. Victor Umeh has backed the governorship aspiration of Prof. Charles Soludo, ex-Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor. He said Soludo, as an expert, had a lot to offer, considering his contributions in rebuilding the Nigerian economy. He spoke on Tuesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka. According to the senator, Soludo stands as the best candidate for the post. Umeh, a former senator for Anambra Central, described the political aspirations of Soludo as apt, as Anambra needed a leader that would consolidate on the success of APGA. He said Soludo, as an expert in the economic sector, would deploy a magical wand that would place Anambra above other states. “Anambra is not a test running centre. A candidate with grand knowledge like Soludo is what we desire. Yes, Anambra has quality men, but for governance, Soludo has a different solution,” he said. Umeh urged the electorate and party faithful to be focused and elect best hand for the governorship seat for the party and work as a team to achieve greater electoral success. “We need to be more united and form a common front for the interest of the party, the state and Igbo extraction in general. Anambra is heartbeat of political activities in Igbo land,” he said. Umeh described the test run of flights at the Anambra International Cargo and Passenger Airport, Umueri, as the seal of Governor Willie Obiano’s great achievements. “Anambra needs a man with capacity to consolidate and take it to greater heights,” he said.
