The Police and Western Nigeria Security Network code-named Amotekun operatives are on the alert, as the herdsmen intercepted by residents of Offa and Ipe in Kwara State are planning to move to Osun State. Residents of Offa and Ipe communities on Tuesday prevented a truckload of suspected herdsmen and cows from entering the state. A statement yesterday by the Director General of Kiriji Heritage Defenders, Dr. Ekundayo Ademola, said the herdsmen were planning to enter Osun State through Odo-Otin Local Government, since there was no security presence in the area. He urged the state government to mobilise security groups -conventional and unconventional ones- to storm the area and flush out the herders before wreaking havoc. Contacted, Osun Amotekun Corps Commander retired Brig.-Gen. Bashir Adewinbi said his men have been deployed in the boundaries to prevent infiltration into the state, especially at Odo-Otin, which is close to the boundary of Kwara State. Police spokesperson Mrs. Yemisi Opalola said the command is aware of the development, adding: “We are monitoring the areas to make sure that there is no illegal movement into the state.”
