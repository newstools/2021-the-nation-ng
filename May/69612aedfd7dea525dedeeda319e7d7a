Harry Kane scored what could be his last ever Tottenham goal to win the Premier League Golden Boot race on the final day of the 2020/21 season. Kane and Mohamed Salah led the way with 22 goals apiece going into game week 38, with the Tottenham and Liverpool stars enjoying prolific campaigns on a personal level even with their teams have struggled to challenge for silverware. Neither could find the net during the penultimate round of games, so it was a case of winner-takes-all on the final day. Kane – who wants to leave Tottenham this summer – struck in a 3-2 win at Leicester to end the season on 23 goals, while he made another to notch 14 assists for the campaign. Salah couldn’t find the net as Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 2-0, so he finished second. Manchester United talisman Bruno Fernandes built on his impressive start to lift at Old Trafford with 18 goals and 12 assists in his first full season with the Red Devils to finish third. Kane’s team-mate Heung-min Son was not far behind in joint fourth place with Leeds’ Patrick Bamford, while Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin ended up sixth with 16 goals.
