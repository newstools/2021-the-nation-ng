Disability has been described to be critical to governance and peace. That was the view of the General Manager, Lagos State Office of Disability Affairs (LASODA), Mr. Ogundairo Oluwadamilare, at a one day workshop for senior officials in local government administration in Lagos State, on the ‘Lagos State Special Peoples’ Law and Inclusive Governance at the Grassroots’, organised by the agency in Ikeja. He said there was the need to carry everybody along, whether able bodied or people living with disabilities, so that all could contribute to the progress and development of any ministry, department or agency they found themselves. Ogundairo said the workshop was organised to re-orientate all tiers of government on the need to make use of the recommendation of the Lagos State Special Peoples’ Law, especially in tandem with the current administration’s policy, which stipulates that workers in all agencies, ministries and departments should be carried along in the day-to-day administration of the office they find themselves, and that there should be no discrimination of any kind. “In the day-to-day running of ministries, departments and àgencies, leave no one behind in decision making. Workers should not be discriminated against as far as decision making is concerned in such MDAs,” he added. The GM said the Discrimination against Disabilities (Proscription) Act of Nigeria was signed into law by President Muhammad Buhari in January 2019, almost a decade after the Lagos State law had come into being. This, according to him, was to complement its effort and ensure that the rights of persons living with disabilities in Lagos State are protected. Highlights of the event include presentations of papers. The workshop was attended by the Chairman, Joint National Association of People with Disabilities (JONAPWD), Dr. Adebukola Adebayo, senior officials in local governments, people living with disabilities and others.
