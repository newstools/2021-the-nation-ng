Residents of Igbudu community in Warri South council area of Delta state on Thursday morning woke up to the burning corpse of an unidentified male, suspected to be a teenager. The incident which occurred around 4am, at Odien Junction, near Globster Gate in Warri, threw people of the area into shock. Saturday Nation gathered that the corpse was suspected to have been set on fire by unknown persons. A source who spoke in confidence said “the case is suspected to be a criminal case, as we came out in the morning to meet the corpse on fire. We don’t know who set the body ablaze and why they killed the person. “We don’t know what happened; we don’t know how it happened. Till this moment as we are talking to you now, no one has come out to say he was robbed.” A resident said, “If something like this can happen here, it means nobody is safe here. “The leaders of this state and the federal government should do something to stop this kind of killing in Delta communities. No one is happy after seeing this corpse.” Recall that the defense chairman, Emion Oghenegweke-Ayiwe and secretary, Victor Midehire of Igbudu community, were killed in yet-to-be unraveled circumstances recently. While the latter was shot dead early Sunday morning, the Midehire was found lifeles, bruised and floating on Warri River, with his hands and legs tied, last Friday. When contacted for comments, the acting Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Edafe Bright confirmed the report. He said, “yes, an unidentified corpse burnt to ashes was found along Odien junction, warri. But we don’t know what happened.”
