The Kaduna State Government has vowed it will not negotiate with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) until electricity is restored. It claimed it was yet to see any evidence the NLC has suspended the five-day warning strike. The Nation reported the workers called off the five-day warning strike on Wednesday in deference to an invitation by the Federal Government to Organised Labour and Kaduna Government to a meeting on Thursday. But government said on Wednesday night “NLC is yet to back off from its economic and social sabotage.” It accused NLC of illegally shutting down the electricity facility on Sunday while insisting on “the restoration of this service.” The statement by Media Adviser to Governor El Rufai, Muyiwa Adekeye, reads in part: “Electric power is yet to be restored, after it was shut down at dawn on Sunday, 16th May 2021, in brazen violation of the laws protecting essential services and infrastructure. “That action removed any basis for state government officials to meet the NLC last Sunday. “Denying our people electricity about 18 hours to the advertised commencement of their organised sabotage was akin to putting a gun on the government’s head. “Government has a lawful duty not to indulge in blackmail. “Restoring electricity is vital to relieving some of the pain that needless acts of lawlessness have
inflicted on our people. “The unimpeded provision of essential services is vital to civilised order. “Those who have disrupted it should promptly reverse themselves, not expect that it will be a matter for negotiation, much less being viewed as a precondition. “KDSG will not participate in such a negotiation or countenance one whilst our people are still being denied their right to electricity.”
