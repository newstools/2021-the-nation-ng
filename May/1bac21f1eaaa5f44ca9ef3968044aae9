  To All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, all hands must be on deck to preserve Nigeria’s unity. He spoke in the company of APC  Interim Chairman Chief Bisi Akande, former Ogun State Governor Olusegun Osoba; one-time Chief of Defence Stass (CDS) Gen. Alani Akinrinade and Chief Pius Akinyelure after a visit to the State House in Abuja on Monday. The Southwest leaders were on mission to commiserate with President Muhammadu Buhari over the death of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt.-Gen. Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and ten others. Speaking to Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) reporter attached to the State House, Tinubu re-restated his position on secession calls by some groups, saying he is for a united Nigeria.  According to him, Nigeria is a nation and in his opinion, it should be preserved that way; as a productive, peaceful and united nation. The former Lagos governor said: “We have already made our position clear; that we want a one, united, peaceful, stable country, productive and promising. Nigeria is not just a rat village, it’s a nation and we want to keep it as one.” Speaking on his mission to the State House Tinubu said the Southwest leaders came to commiserate with President Buhari over the air crash, which claimed Lt. Gen. Attahiru’s life and other military officers and men: “It’s a national loss, it’s demoralising, it’s disheartening, it’s sad, and to rub minds with him too, to see commitment to humanity,” he said.
