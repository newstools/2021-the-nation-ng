Enyimba could only manage a stale 1-1 with Pyramids FC at the Enyimba International Stadium in Aba to crash out of the CAF Confederations Cup on 5-2 aggregate. The Egyptian team were unlikely to face any troubles following their comprehensive 4-1 first-leg victory and winger Ibrahim Adel, who scored twice in the home game, effectively killed off the tie after opening the scoring in the 32nd minute. He robbed an Enyimba defender and curled a superb shot into the top corner of the net. Enyimba levelled the score through a goal from Iwuala Anayo five minutes before the break but Pyramids held on to seal smooth passage to the semis for a second consecutive year. Pyramids’ Argentinian coach Rodolfo Arruabarrena gave rest a number of his regular players following the comfortable first-leg win, including error-prone goalkeeper Sherif Ekramy, who made way for former Egyptian international Ahmed El-Shennawi. However, El-Shennawi was unlucky as he sustained an injury and was replaced for Ekramy in the 37th minute. Last year’s Confederation Cup runners-up Pyramids will face either Morocco’s Raja Casablanca or South Africa’s Orlando Pirates in the semi-final of Africa’s secondary club competition.
