  Governors and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) were not on the same page yesterday over the repayment plan for bailout loans. The governors, under the auspices of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) sought for further deferment of the repayment of the loans taken from the Federal Government. The repayment ought to start this month. But CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele cautioned on the consequences of any further delay. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Mr. Laolu Akande, said the NGF asked for the deferment at the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting.
