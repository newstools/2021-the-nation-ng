The Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, a socio-cultural group,  has expressed concerns over increasing cases of attacks on government facilities and structures of the Nigeria Police in some parts of the country. The FCT Secretary, Ohaneze Ndigbo Elders Committee, Prof. Charles Nwekeaku, who made this known at a forum in Abuja on Friday, said destruction of public facilities was not the way to call attention of government to  grievances. Nwekeaku while urging all aggrieved groups to embrace dialogue in resolving their differences, urged the Igbo in the FCT to be law abiding and continue to work for the corporate existence of the country. He emphasised the need for  government to urgently organise a National Conference where all Ethnic Groups would come together to resolve their differences. He also stressed the need for government agencies to embrace Federal Character in their appointments, recruitments and promotions for Justice and Equity. Nwekeaku maintained that the organisation would continue to compliment government’s efforts at bringing lasting peace and unity to the country. (NAN)
