The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) Worldwide has joined the calls for restructuring of the nation. IYC national spokesman, Comrade Ebilade Ekerefe, made the demand on the Remembrance Day of Ijaw icon and hero, Major Isaac Boro, who was killed 53 years ago. The IYC said: “We believe there’s no better time to restructure this country than now. “President Muhammadu Buhari should as a matter of urgency call for a national dialogue which will serve as a roadmap towards the total restructuring of Nigeria that will reflect the principles of true fiscal federalism. “The 1999 Constitution as amended is lopsided and it cannot guarantee equity, fairness and justice.” Speaking on Boro, the IYC described him as a nationalist, Ijaw leader and a gallant soldier, who was one of the pioneers of minority rights activism and became renowned with his 12- day revolution struggle before he was eventually arrested by the government. The group said the Niger Delta people would not forget Boro’s vision of a region that should be economically independent to transform its landscape. The IYC said: “Boro, like the Ijaw youths, clamoured and drew attention to the plight of the Niger Delta region, and possibly, set it free from the dominance of other major ethnic groups. “Boro’s vision and the visions of our forefathers seem to have moved from violent revolution, armed agitation to intellectual agitations. But the Nigerian government seems to have developed a “steel heart” towards the calls by the people of the region. “Despite their coloured and window dressing of the issues in response to years of agitation, and the ego creation of intervention agencies, which they acceded to and now controlled politically and financially, the Federal Government has become a ‘Pharaoh’ to the Niger Delta people. “They created the NDDC, the Presidential Amnesty Programme and few others to corrupt the political class in the region and weaken these institutions.”
