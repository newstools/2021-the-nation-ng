Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has held an emergency meeting with security commanders in the state following Saturday’s killing of seven policemen by gunmen. Emerging from the meeting, which held in Government House, Port Harcourt, the Governor insisted the state would not succumb to secessionist agenda. The Governor, in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, condemned the attack and called for calm. Wike reiterated that no amount of intimidation or resort to barbaric attacks would make the state align with those bent on plunging Nigeria into another unwarranted crisis. The Governor expressed his deepest condolences to the families of the slain policemen and the Rivers State Police Command. He said: “On behalf of the Government of Rivers State, I wish to offer our heartfelt condolences and express our deep sadness in the wake of these horrific attacks.” Wike urged residents of Rivers State to be calm, as the Security Council had taken measures to secure the state.
