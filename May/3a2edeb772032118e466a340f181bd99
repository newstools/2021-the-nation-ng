Manchester United are willing to use David De Gea as part of their bid to sign Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak, according to reports. The Slovenia international is widely regarded as one of the world’s best goalkeepers and has played a key role in Atletico’s success since his move to Spain in 2014. United, meanwhile, have a tricky goalkeeping situation on their hands as Dean Henderson is pushing hard for De Gea’s place in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. However, Henderson has also failed to convince when he’s deputised for De Gea this season and according to The Sun, United are now planning a bid for Oblak this summer. The report claims that Solskjaer’s ‘closest advisers’ have been urging the United manager to sign Oblak from Atletico. And it’s claimed that United are prepared to include De Gea as part of their deal to land Oblak, who is valued at £70 million. And during his time at Old Trafford, the Spain international has helped the club win the Premier League, the FA Cup, the EFL Cup and the Europa League.
