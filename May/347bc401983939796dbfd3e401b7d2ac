Nigeria’s Tobi Amusan came second behind world record-holder Kendra Harrison in the  women’s 100m hurdles at  the Adidas Boost Boston Games  which was part of the World Athletics Continental Tour Gold series. Featuring four of the top six women in the world rankings , Harrison  finished first with 12.49secs as Amusan finished second to beat Christina Clemons, who took silver behind Harrison at the World Indoor Championships Birmingham 2018 to third place. Meanwhile, .at the Wanda Diamond League season-opener in Gateshead, north-east of England, Blessing Okagbare finished fifth with a time of 11.57secs as Great Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith powered out of the blocks in the loaded 100m final and surged clear of the hitherto-burgeoning US speed queen Sha’Carri Richardson. Richardson arrived in Gateshead on the back of a trio of early-season sub-10.80 clockings back home but the 21-year-old could do nothing to stop Asher-Smith. The winning time, 11.35, was irrelevant, with the rain hammering down and, more pertinently, the trackside wind gauge reading -3.1m/s. The gap, 0.09, was more telling, with Richardson the runner up in 11.44, Ivorian world bronze medallist Marie-Josee Ta Lou third in 11.48 and Jamaica’s three-time world champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce fourth in 11.51.
