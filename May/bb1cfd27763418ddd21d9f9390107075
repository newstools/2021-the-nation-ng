A viral video started it all. Now, Solomon Ukoha, the man who constructed an electrical sub-station with crude oil and other locally sourced materials, is getting his dues. On Tuesday, Abia State Governor Dr Okezie Ikpeazu awarded him a five-year scholarship to further his education in any tertiary institution of his choice. Ukoha is from Amaekpu in Ohafia Local Government Area. Ikpeazu, who made this pronouncement at his lodge in Aba while receiving the 24-year-old Ukoha, expressed joy over the technical ingenuity exhibited by the young innovator, adding that Abia has youths who can compete favourably with their international counterparts in technical education. The governor explained that power supply has been a major problem facing the country and as such has impacted negatively on economic growth and industrialisation, especially in the shoe, leather and garments sub-sectors for which Aba is well known. Ikpeazu encouraged Ukoha to train some other youths and impart knowledge to them for the greater benefit of society. He encouraged him to build a more presentable prototype of the sub-station to enable it to compete in external exhibitions. Ukoha said he completed his secondary school education without any hope of going to university due to financial challenges. He said he got the inspiration for the invention from God. He expressed his readiness to teach other youths.
