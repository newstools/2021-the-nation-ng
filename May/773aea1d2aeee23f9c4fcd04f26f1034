LEON Balogun was missing, but Joe Aribo featured as champions Rangers, ended their Scottish Premiership season unbeaten with a 4-0 win over Aberdeen. Steven Gerrard had already been crowned champions going into their final game of the season but needed to avoid defeat to end the season unbeaten. Aribo played as an unorthodox left-back once again, and he put in a decent shift for the 76 minutes he was on the pitch. The Nigerian international had a 94% pass accuracy while also made one successful interception and tackle, respectively. Rangers settled into the game quickly as Joe Lewis gave them a 1-0 lead inside five minutes. Kemar Roofe then finished off a Ryan Kent assist in the 34th minute before scoring his second on the hour mark following a ball from Ianis Hagi.
