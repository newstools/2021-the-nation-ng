Youths drawn from Anambra have been paying attention to the governorship aspiration of Hon Azuka Okwuosa on social media. The hashtag #LetsFixAnambra has been trending for days, focusing on the programmes and polices of Okwuosa, if elected into office. The trend has turned the All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirant into a social media sensation of a sort. The youths nicknamed him “Mr. Let’s Fix Anambra,” in what observers say is turning to a movement. Okwuosa has been saying “a state does not belong to one man; therefore, it cannot be fixed by a single man”. He enforced that every indigene of Anambra has a role to play in the overall progress of the state, reminding that if Anambrarians leave the job to a Governor or a committee, the work will remain undone, and complaints will continue to surface. His audience feels the same way. From the tweets that ensued, Anambrarians resonated with his opinion. While some hailed Okwuosa for his views, others recalled the unfortunate happenings within the state accusing the current administration of poor performance. Anambrarians are looking forward to the upcoming gubernatorial elections and Hon Okwuosa is gradually shaping the electorate’s minds to play a more active role in ensuring the right man is on the seat. @ifeanyiTheGreat wrote: “Have you listened to this @AzukaOkwuosa’s agenda?
