BELGIAN Youri Tielemans interviewed after the final whistle by BT Sport, did not forget to acknowledge his side’s fortune in seeing that late goal chalked off. “Thank you VAR! Really, what an amazing thing that is!” Tielemans laughed when asked about the decision. “It’s a tough decision but when you have to make it, you have to make it. Maybe it was tight but it was offside, and you have to give that call.” Saturday’s triumph marked the first time in Leicester’s history that they have won the world’s oldest football competition, having previously finished runners-up on four occasions. “It feels really good! It’s amazing! I am really glad to score the goal that helped the team to win the game,” Tielemans added to the BBC. “It was a really tight game. To score in the final … what a goal that was! I am really happy for the team and the fans! The goal was really good! “It is really special to have the fans in today. I hope everyone was safe. And the fans watching it from home, I hope they are proud of us. I am sure they are.
