Tyson Fury’s heavyweight unification fight with Anthony Joshua could be put on hold after an independent arbitrator ruled that the WBC heavyweight champion must face former champion Deontay Wilder in a rematch. Retired judge Daniel Weinstein upheld a claim lodged by Wilder that Fury must face him in a third fight by September 15 following their February 2020 title battle. While the arbitrator’s ruling is not a formal court order, it would be deemed enforceable by courts if Wilder and Fury are unable to reach agreement. Fury’s promoter Frank Warren told the BBC he hoped Wilder would, for a lucrative fee, agree to step aside and allow the bout to go ahead. “Until we can reach an accommodation with Deontay Wilder’s people, I can’t say that (Fury’s fight with Joshua) will definitely happen,” said Warren. “But we are working hard to get that over the line. “We were talking last night and hopefully we can do that. If not then Tyson, if he wishes, will go to the fight with Wilder. They’re the only two options.” Anthony Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn was left fuming by the latest glitch, blaming Fury’s camp for being complacent over the arbitration hearing. “We can’t wait around,” Hearn said on his company Matchroom’s social media channels. We had a deal in place with Tyson Fury and we were told the arbitration wouldn’t be an issue, that we could move on with this fight.” He added:  “They were wrong and that’s on them, that’s their responsibility and their problem.” “We hope they can solve that problem, but we have to look after ourselves and Anthony Joshua. “We have to maintain the position of unified world champion, and those talks will continue and we want to be in a position by the end of this week to know, are we fighting Tyson Fury or are we moving forward with another option.”
