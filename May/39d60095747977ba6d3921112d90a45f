STERLING Homes Limited and Odi-Olowo Local Government Development Council Area (LCDA), Mushin, have partnered to revamp over 27derelict school buildings. The exercise, costing millions of naira to the developer is to, among other things, give a face lift to public schools by remodeling them, including the repainting of the schools, Managing Director, Chief Executive Officer of Sterling, Dr. Kunle Adeyemi, stated.  He said his organisation has consistently done this for the past 11 years as their corporate social responsibility. Using the opportunity of the children’s day, he relieved his childhood, especially the activities around the children’s day celebration and regretted that the spark seems to have waned with time with the dearth of infrastructure in schools and play areas. Responding, the Executive Chairman of LCDA, Hon Rasak Olusola Ajala, commended the firm for its continuous support to the council area and challenged other corporate bodies to emulate them. He said children are gifts from God no matter their sexes and capabilities, adding that if the society must be on the path of greatness; it must start from the attention children are given from the homes in terms of emotional, spiritual and physical well being.
