Some youths in Mosogar in Ethiope West council area of Delta State on Tuesday attacked the local council chair Oghenedoro Owoso. They injured a policeman attached to Owoso and took away his rifle and another one belonging to a second security aide. The youths were protesting an eight-year blackout in the community when the council chair tried to pacify them on the advice of the local divisional police officer, one source said. Two officials of the state were reportedly abducted by the mob. The chairman called for dialogue, saying that violence is counter-productive. He said some suspects have been arrested over the missing rifles.
