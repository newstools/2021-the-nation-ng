An emotional Pep Guardiola claimed Manchester City ‘cannot replace’ Sergio Aguero after their all-time top scorer played his final Premier League game for the club. The Argentine, who will leave City after 10 years in the summer when his contract ends, signed off in style with two goals in a 5-0 victory over Everton as he lifted his fifth Premier League trophy. Aguero’s 260 goals for City make him by far and away their leading scorer and despite allowing him to move on, Guardiola said his qualities as a player and person will be impossible to replicate in the future. When asked about Aguero, the teary Spaniard told Sky Sports: ‘We love him so much. He is a special person for all of us. He is so nice, he is so nice. He helped me a lot, he’s so good. ‘We cannot replace him. We cannot. ‘They are many players we have had to discard like him, Joe Hart and David Silva, who have helped us this club to be what it is. ‘He came on today showed his quality for 30 minutes.”
