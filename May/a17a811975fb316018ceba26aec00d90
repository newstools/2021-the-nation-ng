Thirteen-year-old Treasure Ofuya, who reportedly went missing after school hours last Wednesday, has been found. She was found eight days after she went missing in polytechnic community of Oghara, Ethiope West council area of Delta State. Acting police spokesman Edafe Bright confirmed the development, but could not give any details on the development. “Missing Treasure Ofuya has been found in Oghara. She is currently with the police and will be reunited with her family soon,” he stated. The Nation, on Monday, reported that Treasure went missing after closing from school which is located along Jakpa Road in Uvwie council area of the state. Her mother, Faith Ofuya, had explained that she had had a tiff with her teenage daughter the previous evening, over alleged misuse of her phone and possession of a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). But she could not ascertain if Treasure went away because of their disagreement, noting that she appeared normal when she left for school the following morning.
