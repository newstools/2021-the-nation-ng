Following the postponement of the African qualifiers  for the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup, Nigeria  Football Federation (NFF) are now sweating on the possibilities of organising some top  friendly matches for the Super Eagles. The CAF Emergency Committee, in consultation with FIFA, decided to postpone the CAF qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022  due to be played  next month after taking into consideration the current challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to ensure the optimal playing conditions for all participating teams. The qualifiers, according to CAF will now take place in the existing windows of September, October and November 2021, and March 2022. The continental ruling body said in a statement that it was ‘reassessing its protocols and processes to enhance the implementation of COVID-related protocols, including specifically focusing on pre-match testing which had been the source of some challenges in previous windows.’ The Super Eagles were originally scheduled to begin their long campaign towards a place in the first FIFA World Cup to be hosted in the Middle East with a home match against the Leone Stars of Liberia on the weekend of June 5 to 8 while they travel away to Cape Verde on the weekend of June 11 to 14. But German coach Gernot Rohr confirmed yesterday that the NFF must now look at the possibility of getting friendly matches in order to keep the players in top shape even more so when most European leagues will soon be on break. “We have to organise friendlies now and we already have some African countries in mind,” noted the former Bayern Munich defender.
