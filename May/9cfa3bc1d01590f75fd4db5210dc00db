Bandits have been neutralised in Brinin Gwari local government area in Kaduna by the Operation Thunder Strike (OPTS) component of the Nigerian Air Force. Some gunmen also attacked two communities in Chikun and Kajuru local government areas, killing two persons and injuring six others. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan yesterday said the military operation against the bandits in Birnin Gwari was carried out in response to credible intelligence that bandits were congregating in some locations to carry out attacks in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area. He revealed that the mission was conducted around the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari Road, where the bandits were engaged and neutralised. A similar operation was also carried out over Kaduna-Abuja Road, including surrounding settlements. Aruwan said, security agencies reported that armed bandits invaded Mazari, a community close to Buruku in Chikun council where one Mariya Sale was killed and three injured.
