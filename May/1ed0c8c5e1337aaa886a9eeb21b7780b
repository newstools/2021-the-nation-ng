 The local government primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held in Lagos State yesterday witnessed a large turnout by party members. The elections were also marked by skirmishes in some parts of the state, including Ikorodu North Local Council Development Authority (LCDA), following the disappearance of the Returning Officer, Chairman Electoral Committee and other officials sent from the state chapter of the party to conduct the election. Trouble started after party members gathered at the party’s LGA secretariat for the collation of the votes cast at the various wards. Earlier, voting had been concluded and counted in three of the five wards in the LCDA while voting could not take place in two others owing to sporadic shooting by gunmen. The votes counted and declared in the three wards showed that one of the chairmanship aspirants, Mathew Adesanya, won in all three.  But the state electoral officials failed to show up at the party secretariat for collation of votes and announcement of winners, leading to serious protests. In Ojuelegba area of Surulere Local Government, the election was also marred by a clash between two rival cult groups which were said to have engaged themselves even before the primary elections. It was gathered that arrests were made by security officials. The Returning Officer for Itire-Ikate Local Council Development Area, Mr Lateef Ibirogba and his counterpart in Somolu Local Government, Amida Abudu, were also attacked by some thugs who were also said to have stolen Ibirogba’s handset and bag. In Somolu Local Government, some thugs attacked the venue of the primary election, injuring the council chairman’s aide identified simply as Ajimomuya.
