 The Director,  Institute of African Studies,  University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) , Prof. Florence Orabueze, has underscored the need for students to embrace traditional ways of life. This, she said, would ensure  discipline and eradicate bad habits among current and future generation  of youths. She noted that it was  important to observe African traditional feasts and festivals  as a  method of retaining the country’s cultural  heritage. Orabueze made this known at the Princess Alexandra Hall, UNN, during an international symposium organised by an academic group — Research and Development Initiative — in collaboration with  the Department of Music, History, English and Institute of African Studies, UNN, to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of  Bob Marley’s demise. It was tagged: “Bob Marley, Black Civilisation and Pan Africanism.” She  noted that many challenges plaguing the country could be blamed on the little attention given culture and tradition. Performing her late father’s music, Oge Kimono, daughter of the late music icon Oseloke Augustine Onwubuya, popularly known as Ras Kimono, lauded the VC, Prof. Charles Igwe, for the attention being paid to arts and culture in the institution,noting that it  would help to achieve much needed unity among citizens as well in the academia. She urged  the students to be prudent in their ways of relating with one another. She noted that being prudent was a  major factor towards being successful. Dr. Uche Nwaezuoke, a lecturer in the Department of History,  said the symposium had over thhe years grown by providing relevant information in tackling societal problems. He urged musicians  to engage in meaningful music that can change the mindset of the youths  for good instead of causing division in the country. The event  was well attended by   dignitaries from the state and across the country.
