Local government council areas in Lagos have the capacity to generate over N100billion revenue annually, Oguntebi Dele, a management consultant has said. Dele, who sits atop as Principal Consultant at De-Delpedge made this disclosure at the Agbado Oke-Odo Economic Summit 2021. According to him, Lagos state has access to bigger revenue sources that they have had to neglect other revenue generating streams within the state. He lamented that many local government councils dissipate energy and resources chasing revenue sources such as licenses for bicycle, and radio that can only generate meager income. From available record, the tax expert said, “Lagos has only been able to raise 20% to 30% of revenue on tenement rates and is because many at times demand notices are issued but how many are enforced.” He however, appealed to council chairmen to systematically push their revenue sources to areas it can be collated and explore digital tools to curb compromises and corruption within the system. Also speaking at the event, a member of the House of Representatives, Ajeromi Ifelodun Federal Constituency, Hon. Musibau Kolawole Taiwo said that local government areas in Lagos have enormous potential to generate revenue within their area but it is imperative that they create an enabling environment for businesses to strive. Responding, the Chairman of Agbado Oke-Odo, LCDA, David Famuyiwa said that the summit as a community based interactive forum attracts participant from all walks of life who are expected to incubate ideas and share the experiences of others on how to solve the economic challenges hindering the development of our communities.
