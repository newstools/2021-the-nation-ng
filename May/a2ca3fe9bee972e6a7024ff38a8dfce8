Nigeria-Wales-born music act, Monique B has expressed her desire to create feel-good music with popular sounds. Monique B made this known in a recent chat saying, “I just want to create feel-good music with a popular sound, I keep this in mind when I write and produce my songs.” Hugely influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince, Chaka Khan, Frank Ocean, and Burna Boy, Monique’s latest single, ‘Revolving Doors’ featuring Reuel Elijah, has been making waves in the UK and Nigeria. The song, which has also made it to many radio station’s playlists including BBC Flex FM), is inspired by the will to move on. “The song is about moving on, but with positive change and to trust the process, to trust that when one door closes another door opens. Giving yourself a chance to be happy again in life, may it be a career, love, or a new venture,” Monique says. Monique was formerly part of the popular musical group in Wales, The Baby Queen, which was formed by a family of two sisters, two cousins, and an adopted sister namely Cara Elise, Estelle Ios, Monique Bux, Ruth Vibes, and Vanity.
