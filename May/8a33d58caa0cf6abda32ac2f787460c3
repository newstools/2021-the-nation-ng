Popular Nollywood actress of the ‘Everyday People’ fame, Ifey Onwuemene is dead. The Nation learnt she died of cancer. An actress, Gloria Young-Anozie, who broke the sad news, said: “Onwuemene was diagnosed of endometrical cancer.  “Her womb was removed but she has been battling the ailment for many years now. In 2019, after 8 sessions of chemotherapy, the doctors told her that she had reached stage 4. “However we are not sure if she was given the wrong diagnosis. Ify spent over N10m being helped with donations by fellow actors and other Nigerians. “A gofundme account was opened for her but it did not yield much. She had to go for draining every two weeks at a cost of N280,000 but only three litres of liquid can be removed at a time so that her heart is not affected.”
