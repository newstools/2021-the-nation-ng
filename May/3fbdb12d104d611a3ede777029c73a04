Staff of the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic (RUPIGO) Owo in Ondo State on Tuesday grounded academic activities in the institution over eight months unpaid salaries and non-promotion of staff for three years. All entrance gates to the institution were blocked by the placards bearing protesters. The protesters said the institution’s management and the school Governing Council refused to pay their salaries for over eight months Chairman of the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Polytechnics, (SSANIP) Comrade Chris Olowolade, said they could no longer cope with the sufferings associated with working without getting paid. He said no staff of the institution has been promoted in the last three years.  According to him, “We have spoken with the management several times about our grievances, nothing was done till today. That is why we embarked on this peaceful protest to seek intervention of our dear Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. We plead for the payment of our salary arrears for about 8months. “Workers deserve their wages, we can no longer cater for our families as a result if nonpayment of our salaries; we beg Mr Governor to look into our plight at RUGIPO,” Olowolade said. On his part, Chairman, Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) RUGIPO chapter, Comrade Adebayo Obayoriade, urged the management to urgently settle the unpaid salaries.  The NASU Chairman said, “There is no promotion in this poly in the last three years. How can you boost morale of your workforce when there is no promotion? We are tired of this situation; we want the management of this school to act to save the staff. Rector of the institution, Mr Gani Ogundahunsi who was accompanied by some Chiefs from the Olowo of Owo’s palace, pleaded with the aggrieved workers to give him some time to attend to their demands.
