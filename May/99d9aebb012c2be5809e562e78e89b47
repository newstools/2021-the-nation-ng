The Osun State Government on Tuesday shut down Inisha Town Central Mosque in Odo-Otin Local Government Area over crisis surrounding installation of a new Imam. The government banned all activities and central congregation at the mosque for Eid prayers. The Nation reports a traditional chief, Eesa of Inisha, Chief Enoch Ajiboso, slumped and died on December 20, 2020 at the palace while settling a dispute between two parties contending to be the Chief Imam of the community. A statement by the Osun State Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr Adeyanju Binuyo, noted the decision was reached following inability of the Muslim Community of the town to peacefully install a new Imam for the mosque. “Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, as part of efforts to ensure the security of lives and properties in that axis of the State, directed that the Central Mosque be shut indefinitely to forestall further religious or communal crisis. Already the Mosque has recorded the death of two Imams in quick succession. “Security operatives have been deployed to the town to enforce the closure and ban on Eid Prayers. This directive will be in place until the reconciliatory process towards amicable resolution is concluded. “Members of the public are advised to be guided by this directive,” he ended.
