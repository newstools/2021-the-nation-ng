 The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State is set for local government primaries across the 377 wards in 57 councils. No fewer than 338 chairmanship and over 1, 200 councillorship aspirants have appeared before the Screening Committee in the last two weeks. The Appeal Committee is headed by former Deputy Governor Olufemi Pedro. The Pedro panel has concluded its assignment by giving failed aspirants the opportunity to ventilate their grievances. The Secretary of the Lagos State chapter of the APC, Lanre Balogun, said the party was ready for the primaries holding tomorrow.
