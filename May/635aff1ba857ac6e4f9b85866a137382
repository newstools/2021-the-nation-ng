Egypt has signed a deal with France to buy 30 Rafale fighter jets, a statement by the Egyptian Armed Forces said on Tuesday. “The deal will be financed through a loan to be re-paid over at least 10 years,’’ the statement said, without disclosing the value of the deal. The deal, signed between the Egyptian Armed Forces and the French Dassault Aviation company, aims to develop Egypt’s capabilities, it added. In 2015, Egypt received 24 French Rafale aircraft in a deal that allowed the purchase of more Rafale jets and warships in the future. (Xinhua/NAN)
