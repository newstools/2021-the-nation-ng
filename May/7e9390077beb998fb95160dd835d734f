  The Lagos State Ministry of Women Affairs in collaboration with the United Nations Population fund (UNFPA) have sensitised students on sexual, gender-based violence. At a workshop for student leaders in nine out of the fifteen higher institutions in the state, Commissioner of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Mrs. Cecilia Bolaji Dada, said: “Major perpetrators of the evil acts are youths and students. We are working to eradicate every form of sexual and gender-based violence. “Sexual and gender based violence is a social menace, which tertiary Institutions must support as citadels grooming the pivotal generation, to curb gender stereotyping, discriminatory practices and unequal gender relations.  “It  also brings to fore, the need to eradicate explicit or acts of physical violence, bullying verbal or sexual harassment, nonconsensual touching, sexual coercion and assault, and rape just to mention a few. “Noteworthy that burdens like these, are borne more by ladies, with such effects culminating often to low the self-esteem of survivors, physical injuries, physical and mental health illnesses, unwanted pregnancies, as well as suicidal behaviours and even death.” “It is clear thus, that sexual and gender-based violence is a major systemic barrier to women development, thereby limiting their contributions to economic growth. “In lieu of this, the Lagos State Government has enacted laws and policies such as the Lagos State Domestic Violence Law, which stipulates a jail term of 25 years, for any rapist and perpetrators of all forms of intimate partner violence.”
