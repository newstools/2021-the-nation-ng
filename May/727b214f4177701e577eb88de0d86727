Henry Onyekuru and Oghenekaro Etebo’s dreams of lifting the Turkish Super Lig with Galatasaray have been dashed after Besiktas emerged as champions for the 13th  time in their history. Onyekuru did not make the matchday squad while Etebo sat on the bench throughout as Galatasaray handed a 3-1 defeat to Yeni Malatyaspor in Istanbul. But it was still not enough as coach Fatih Terim’s side finished second behind Besiktas on goal difference. Besiktas won 2-1 at Goztepe to amass 84 points, equal with their eternal city rivals, but a superior plus one goal difference sealed the title for them in one of the closest races in recent memories. In Italy, Simy Nwankwo scored his 20th  league goal of the season in Crotone’s 1-1 draw against Benevento, making the lanky striker the second African after Samuel Eto’o to reach the 20 goal mark in a single season in the Italian Serie A. Eto’o scored 21 league goals for Inter Milan in 2010/2011 campaign- the highest scored by an African in a single season of the Italian top-flight. Still in Italy, Victor Osimhen played for 84 minutes to help Napoli beat Fiorentina 2-0 in the Italian Serie A and move just one win away from securing Champions League football next season. Napoli went into the clash, knowing a win would put them back into the top four ahead of the final round of games next weekend. In Holland, Tyronne Ebuehi helped FC Twente to a narrow 3-2 victory over ADO Den Haag and a tenth place finish while Maduka Okoye made three saves as Sparta Rotterdam finish in a European playoff spot following their hard-earned victory at SC Heerenveen.
