Anambra State Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Mr Adeoye Irelewuyi has decried increasing cases of speeding-related accidents in the state, blaming it on driving beyond speed limits. He advocated a low-speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour in cities and built-up areas to reduce incessant road traffic crashes in the state. Speaking in Awka on Monday to commence the 6th United Nations Global Road Safety Week (UNGRSW), themed, ‘Streets for Life’, Irelewuyi said lowering speed limits in urban areas would further reduce fatality risks and keep vulnerable road users safe, including pedestrians, cyclists, children, elders and people with disabilities. He regretted that comparative analysis of 2021 and 2020 crashes caused by speeding from January to May showed an increase was recorded in year 2021 over 2020. He said while road accidents due to speeding from Jan. to May 2020 were 27, there were 71 in the same period of 2021, representing 70 per cent increase. “Whether minor or severe, accidents can drastically change a person’s life. They can result in a loss of lives, pain and suffering, or permanent disabilities. “Inspite of proactive measures and enforcement on installation of speed limiting devices, we have discovered that speeding is the leading cause of crashes on our roads. “We are therefore calling on the government and policy makers to act for low speed limit of 30 km/hr in areas like Eke Awka, Nnewi environs, Onitsha municipals and other cities in Anambra. “We believe that when we have a safer speed limit, road accidents will drastically reduce in the state, “he said. Commissioner for Transportation in the state, Mr. Afam Mbanefo praised FRSC for supporting and ensuring control and checks on the transporters to reduce road crashes. He pledged government continued partnership with the Corps to bring about safety, security and driving ethics among motorists.
