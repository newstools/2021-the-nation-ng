President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, met behind closed doors with President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The agenda of the meeting between the two leaders was unknown to State House correspondents as at the time of filing this report. Akufo-Addo is chairman of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). He also used the opportunity to condole with government and people of Nigeria over the last Friday’s plane crash that killed Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and ten other officers and men of the Nigerian Armed Forces in Kaduna. Akufo-Addo had earlier in the day attended the 2021 ECOWAS Parliament first Extraordinary Session at ECOWAS headquarters, Abuja, where he called on West African leaders to consolidate efforts to root out terrorism from the region. He noted despite best efforts in dealing with the menace by the ECOWAS leaders, there were persistent attempts to destabilise several countries of the ECOWAS community. He said these include attacks on state symbols, to civilian populations and military bases. According to Akufo-Addo, this has been the case recently in Niger, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Nigeria.
