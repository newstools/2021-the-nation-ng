By OLUSHOLA  RICKETTS  NIGERIAN billionaire, Terry Waya, celebrated his 60th birthday last Monday in Abuja and it was opportunity for his intimate friends to reconnect and unwind. The likes of Orji Uzor Kalu, James Ibori and House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila graced the dinner party. Waya was the toast of society back in the mid-90s to early 2000s. He returned to the spotlight again when his son, Kidd Waya, participated in the last edition of Big Brother Naija reality show.  As the photos of the birthday dinner circulated all over the social media space, his ex-wife, Susan Waya, also took time out to recall their early days together. Sharing a throwback photo someone posted when their love was waxing strong, she wrote: “True love never fails! Thanks to whoever posted it.” Apparently, someone had posted the photo, which she appreciated by reposting it on her Instagram page. Waya’s private life remains a puzzle. There are two women he has ever been associated with publicly: Susan, who has two sons for him, including Kidd, was his first wife. But there is also Eno Udoh, the pretty socialite who was also once married.
