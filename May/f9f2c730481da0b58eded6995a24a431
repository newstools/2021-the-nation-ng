Senior Pastor of the House on the Rock Church, Paul Adefarasin, has advised members of his church to plan their exit from Nigeria due to the worrisome trend of insecurity. In the now-viral video obtained by The Nation where he was speaking to his congregation, Adefarasin said his wife, Ifeanyi, was absent from the service because she was taking care of some things outside the country. He said: “I bring you greetings from Pastor Ifeanyi who is busy taking care of the frontier of our world and preparing our escape route. “If you don’t have a plan B. I know you have faith, I have faith too but I have a plan B. “With technology, I can speak to you from anywhere in the world. “Get yourself a plan B. Whether that’s an Okada to Cameroon or a flying boat to Seme Border, a hole in the ground, a bunker as we call it. Just get yourself a plan B because these people are crazy. They are nutters, the whole bunch of them. And watch the signs because it can happen, just like this (snaps fingers). “The foundation is that document and if the foundation is faulty, what can the righteous do? Go back to the foundation. “The next administration must not access power until we have a veritable constitution that is truly the document of we the people,” Adefarasin added.
