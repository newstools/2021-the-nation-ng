Despite suffering defeat in the Champions League semi-final, Toni Kroos has still found the time to reply to Mason Mount, continuing the spat with the Chelsea playmaker. Real Madrid were well beaten by Chelsea over both legs, although prior to the meeting Kroos suggested that in his 15-year career none of Chelsea’s individual players had caused him to lose sleep. Mount’s response after scoring the goal which ultimately put the tie beyond Los Blancos was equally as intriguing.  “I saw one of their players say that none of our players stop him from sleeping, maybe he should lose a bit of sleep for our team, we could have scored more than five goals,” Mount admitted to BT Sport. Kroos, took the time to send one final response over to the former Vitesse Arnhem midfielder, with what can be considered a sly dig at the end. “I’m still sleeping well, but well done yesterday. Congratulations and good luck in your first Champions League final,” Kroos posted on Twitter.
