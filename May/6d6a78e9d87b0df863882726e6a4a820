 The Onishasha of Shasha in Alimosho Local Government Area (LGA), Oba Babatunde Ogunrombi yesterday declared as illegal, the appointment of a Baale in Akowonjo without his consent. Oba Ogunrombi said Akowonjo and its environs are part of Shasha Kingdom and, thus, no one can be lawfully appointed as baale in the community unless the Onishasha approves it. He warned residents and political leaders to shun illegal appointment of leaders and land deals that could jeopardise the peace between Shasha and neighbouring kingdoms. “The appointment of baale in Akowonjo without my consent is illegal and unacceptable, so leaders and residents should be warned that no appointment should be done without the consent of the throne of Shashaland. “Shasha community shares a boundary with Idimu community, Egbeda Community and Ejigbo land, so everybody should note this and accord Shasha the regard it deserves if leaders are to be appointed on its lands,” the monarch said in a statement.
