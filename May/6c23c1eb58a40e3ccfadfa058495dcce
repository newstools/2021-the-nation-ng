Former Manchester United and Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez scored twice as Italian champions Inter Milan thrashed Sampdoria. In their first match since being confirmed as the winners of Serie A for the first time in 11 years, Inter were 3-1 up at half-time. Roberto Gagliardini opened the scoring for Antonio Conte’s side before Sanchez scored two in the space of 10 minutes. Andrea Pinamonti added a fourth before Lautaro Martinez’s penalty. Sampdoria, whose goal came from Senegal winger Keita Balde, are ninth in the table with three matches remaining. Inter are 15 points clear of second-placed Napoli, who won 4-1 away to Spezia earlier on Saturday.
