Manchester City versus Chelsea in the Champions League final on May 29 is unlikely to be staged at Istanbul’s Ataturk Stadium. The final was originally scheduled to be played in Turkey’s largest city, but the Eurasian nation is still in the midst of a national lockdown, with a recent surge in coronavirus cases. It is currently a ‘red list’ country, meaning travel is not permitted for leisure purposes. The UK government remains keen to help facilitate hosting the all-English final at Wembley for safety reasons, as well as being able to facilitate Manchester City and Chelsea fans attending.
