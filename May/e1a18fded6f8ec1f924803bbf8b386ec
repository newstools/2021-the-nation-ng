Disc Jockey, Florence Ifeoluwa Otedola aka DJ Cuppy, has taken some time to thank her billionaire father, Femi Otedola for working so hard to provide for herself and the entire family. Cuppy, in a series of tweets, said she woke up feeling grateful for enjoying all the good things of life as a result of her father’s hard work. Even though she has properties in Nigeria and overseas, Cuppy still thinks she owes it all to her dad who had paved the way for a long time ago. “I don’t talk about this much, but mornings like this; waking up at our penthouse in Monaco, my heart is filled with so much gratitude. I am honored and blessed to have a father as hardworking as mine”, she tweeted. “Despite building my own “Cuppy” empire, the TRUTH is that many of the privileges I enjoy are purely due to @realFemiOtedola’s blood, sweat, and tears over the years. “My only prayer is to one day be able to give my own children at least half the love and generosity I’ve received”.
