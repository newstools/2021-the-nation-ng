The Federal Government has kicked against the bill seeking to scrap the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), saying it has commenced moves to reform the scheme. The Nation reports the scheme has come under heavy criticism of late because of the deteriorating security situation in the country. The bill, sponsored by Awaji Abiante, a lawmaker from Rivers State last week has reached the second reading in the House of Representatives. Abiante seeks to use the bill to amend section 315 (1)(a) of the 1999 constitution. He argued that NYSC should be scrapped because the scheme has failed to address the essence of its establishment. But reacting, Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, in a post on his official Twitter page said NYSC is one of the greatest tools for National development for Nigerian youths. Dare stated that dynamic reforms and initiatives towards the current realities are ongoing, adding that the Buhari-led administration is committed to sustaining the scheme. “The NYSC scheme remains one of the greatest tools for National development for our youth. “The commitment of the government to sustaining the NYSC scheme remains. Dynamic Reforms and Initiatives towards current realities are ongoing. Nigeria will stand with her youth,” he tweeted. The bill, which is a constitution alteration bill, will have to go through second reading, committee stage, the committee of the whole, third reading, concurrence with Senate and passage by two-third of the Houses of Assembly in states before a final assent by the President.
