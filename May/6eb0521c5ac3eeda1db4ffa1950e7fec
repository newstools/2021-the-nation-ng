TVS King has won the Tricycle Brand of the Year award at the eighth Annual Nigeria Transport Awards, organised by Transport Day. Also known as Keke, the brand of tricycles is manufactured by TVS Motor Company in India and assembled, distributed and serviced by Wandel International – part of the Simba Group of Companies in Nigeria. TVS tricycles and TVS Motor Company had won other global awards, including being the only tricycle manufacturer to have received the Deming Prize – the highest award for Total Quality Management in the world. Automotive Business Head at Simba, Mahendra Prata, said: “This award has been possible thanks to the trust our valued customers have in our product as well as the efforts of all our employees and our esteemed channel partners. “It inspires us to keep providing Nigeria with the ideal solutions for last-mile transport.” Simba Group Head of Marketing, Karthik Govindarajan, added: “When customers choose to purchase a tricycle, they look above all for reliability and dependability. That’s why for over 10 years now, TVS King has been their number one choice. “When they buy their first, they are drawn to the quality and features – matters intrinsic to TVS Motors – but when they choose TVS again after years of reliable service, they make that choice because they trust in the brand, and the huge emphasis Simba and TVS put into after-sales service and the availability of spare parts nationwide.” The company said it has one of the widest networks of tricycle service centres in the country and has also trained thousands of riders and mechanics in maintenance.
