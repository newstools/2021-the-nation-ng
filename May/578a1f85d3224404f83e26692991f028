Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has described the killing of former Special Adviser on Political Matters to President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Gulak, as very shocking, disturbing and unacceptable. Governor Akeredolu, in a statement he personally signed, said the murder of Gulak was one too many, senseless and wicked. Akeredolu said the perpetrators were enemies of Nigeria determined to mislead, confuse and destroy. According to him: “It bears the unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists bent on setting the country on the path of conflagration. These criminals must not be allowed to succeed. “We want to use this medium to express our solidarity with our brother Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma. “We admonish him and other Governors in the South Eastern States to brace up and confront the current security challenge to put an end to the bloodbath in the land. “The enemies of the people always employ the weapon of fear to create disaffection in the polity. “This cowardly act is calculated to instigate Nigerians against each other, particularly Northerners, against the Igbo living outside the South East. “We must confront the enemies of the people with a view to neutralizing them. This is definitely not the time for political correctness. Banditry should not be allowed to subvert the legitimacy of the current Government at all levels. “We call on all security agencies to collaborate with a view to unveiling the criminal elements sponsoring and undertaking terrorist acts. they must be punished, severely.”
