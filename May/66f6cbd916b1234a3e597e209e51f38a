Leicester City centre-forward Kelechi Iheanacho has praised his  striking compatriots including Napoli’s Victor Osimhen, Genk’s Paul Onuachu, Almeria’s Sadiq Umar, Lorient’s Terem Moffi and Crotone’s Simy Nwankwo for their goal scoring performances this season. Iheanacho has been in a rich vein of form and netted his 20th  goal of the season in Leicester’s 1-2 defeat to Chelsea on Tuesday. The attacker also helped Leicester win the FA Cup for the first time. Umar has been turning heads with Almeria and is close to helping the club return to La Liga, having scored 26 goals while Paul Onuachu has also been in terrific form, for Genk in the current campaign firing on all cylinders and has now taken his tally to 37 goals across all competitions. Simy Nwankwo was a shining spark sparking Crotone’s disappointing season, netting 20 goals for the relegated Serie A side while Terem Moffi has 16 goals in the French Ligue 1. “If I go on social media, I see Nigerian strikers scoring. I ask myself what is going on,” Iheanacho told ESPN.”It is very good for the country, It would help us move forward.” Iheanacho hinted that there is no competition in the national team, adding that each player brings their unique qualities to the team. “There is no competition in the team, Everyone has their own quality and the way they play,” he added.  “It is left for the manager to know how he is going to utilize everyone in their position. “It doesn’t matter who gets called up tomorrow, all that matters is you perform very well for your country and give your best when you are called up,” he noted.
