Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has denied claims by Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho that he is in support of the agitation of a sovereign Yoruba nation. Igboho was at the Ilana Omo Oodua rally in Akure, which he reportedly said Governor Akeredolu was in support of. But the Governor in a statement on Sunday by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olabode, said it was erroneous for the secessionists to claim to have had his support for the rally. Akeredolu noted his desire to acknowledge the right of individuals and groups to hold peaceful rally must not be misconstrued to mean support for secessionist agenda and or balkanization of the nation. He stated he was not opposed to any civil protest, which was not in breach of the extant laws of the nation. According to him: “The Governor neither believes, nor supports the quest for the Yoruba Nation outside of Nigeria in the manner canvassed. Governor Akeredolu stands by a virile, united and indivisible Nigeria as demanded by the Southern Governors’ Forum. “Therefore, the vigour, zeal, leadership and candour displayed by Governor Akeredolu for a just and fair Nigeria is altruistic, and borne out of patriotism for the Nation as well as love for his people, the Yoruba ethnic nationality. “It is important, therefore, to state without any equivocation that the Yoruba Nation secessionist promoters do not enjoy any lending hand in Governor Akeredolu.”
