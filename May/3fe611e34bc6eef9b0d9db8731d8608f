Former U-23 star, Taiwo Awoniyi remains a doubt for Union Berlin ahead of their tomorrowâ€™s German Bundesliga tie with Bayer Leverkusen. The Nigerian recently return to training from a thigh injury that has kept him out of action since February 20th and has not fully regained match fitness. With only two games to the end of the season, it remains unclear if Awoniyi will still be able to lace his boot for Union Berlin who he has played 19 games and scored five goals. His loan spell ends on June 30 but the German Bundesliga season comes to an end on May 22 with Union Berlin hosting RB Leipzig.
