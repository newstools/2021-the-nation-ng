A Kano-Abuja Max Air plane on Tuesday developed engine failure10 minutes after take off from the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA), causing fear among passengers. The Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado-Bayero, was among the many passengers onboard the faulty plane. The Max Air aircraft, marked VM1645, was scheduled to take off by 1.30 pm. It however, took off at 2:00 pm, 30 minutes behind departure time, it was learnt. 10 minutes after take-off, the aircraft, filled with passengers to the brim, reportedly began to “swerve around the air” until it made a detour for an emergency landing. The Nation gathered the incident was caused by an “engine failure.” Max Air had not spoken on the incident yet as at press time. A palace source,who was also onboard the plane, confirmed the incident to newsmen, saying “we smelt death.” One of the passengers, Dr Samaila Suleiman, said it was “a near-death incident,” as he accused the airline of negligence. “I heard a strange sound during the take-off but I waved it. I have been flying by aircraft many times but I have never heard such a sound during take-off. “The sound was strange but I dismissed any strange feeling of insecurity. “No radio announcement was even made until we saw ourselves back at the airport where we took off. “It was a near-death experience. I and many other passengers were traumatised. Many of us canceled the trip and returned home,” Suleiman said. However, Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado-Bayero, and some of the other passengers were still flown to Abuja in the same Max Air plane after it was fixed.
