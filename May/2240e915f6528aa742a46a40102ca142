Liverpool have triggered Ibrahima Konate’s £36m release clause and hope to finalise a deal for the RB Leipzig defender in the next few days. Discussions are under way between Liverpool and Leipzig for the 22-year-old centre-back. Konate made 21 appearances for Leipzig this season, including eight Bundesliga starts as the club finished second – 13 points behind champions Bayern Munich. The France U21 international would boost Jurgen Klopp’s defensive options, with Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip all hoping to return for the start of next season after missing the majority of the 2020-21 campaign through injury.
