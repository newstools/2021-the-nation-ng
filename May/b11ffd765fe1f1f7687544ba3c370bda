The Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle Group, Ebi Egbe has called on the federal government to do something on the state of the roads in the country, declaring that the state of the Port Harcourt-Aba road is a bad advertisement for the country. Pyramids FC of Egypt, during their recent trip to Nigeria for the CAF Confederation Cup quarterfinals clash with Enyimba of Aba, posted a video of their road trip from Port Harcourt to Aba calling it a shame. Egbe whose outfit constructed the Enyimba stadium turf noted that the Egyptians deliberately wanted to paint the country in bad light by showing the video to the world. Egbe was however quick to add that the government on its part also needs to avoid the country being embarrassed by her international visitors by fixing our roads. “That video by Pyramids is to me, a wakeup call for us to not only fix our stadiums but also fix our roads. Teams that come to Aba to play have always commended the playing pitch. We need to get it right on all fronts. This is why I am appealing to the federal government to get our roads fixed. Our teams would return to the continent next term and it would be a shame if teams from other countries that are far less endowed come in and mock us that we’ve got no roads in the country,” Egbe said. He further charged the various state governments to also upgrade their stadium facilities just like other countries are doing.
