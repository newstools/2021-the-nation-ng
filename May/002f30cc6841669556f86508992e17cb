The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State has moved to stop Governor Seyi Makinde and the leadership of the Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC) from conducting the local government election scheduled for Saturday. The party alleged its exclusion from the election, stressing that the governor was out to waste the stateâ€™s scarce resources again and make a mockery of democracy and the rule of law. It said the plan to go ahead with the conduct of the local government election without the APC and other registered parties was legally wrong. Although judiciary workers are on strike across the nation, the APC said it has filed its processes to the chief judge of the state with the expectation that he will assign it to a judge for expeditious hearing, based on the importance and time limitation for the issues raised for litigation. The Caretaker Committee Chairman of the APC in Oyo State, Chief Akin Oke, made this known yesterday at a news conference in Ibadan. He said it became compulsory for him to address the press on the alleged deliberate and unconstitutional acts of OYSIEC, which has excluded the APC from the local government election. Oke recalled that the court action of the members of the Association of Local Governments (ALGON) in Oyo State challenging the dissolution of the duly elected executives of the 33 local governments and 35 local councils development areas (LCDAs) in the state was finally laid to rest by the Supreme Court judgment of May 7.
