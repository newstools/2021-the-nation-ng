DUBAI-BASED jeweler Philip Ikezahu has announced the launch of his dual business entities in Nigeria – ‘Soso Music Worldwide and SMW fashion line’. Ikezahu disclosed that his Soso Music worldwide will  focus on music recording, publishing, promotion, and artistes management while his clothing line will be targeted at creating and setting fashion trends across Africa. Ikezahu explains the aim of synergising music and fashion saying “this is to create our market in pop culture and harness it to its fullest. This is because there is a reason to invest in the fastest growing sector of the economy in Africa.”  “If you look closely, with Nigeria championing the music and fashion industry in Africa, you will discover that these two sectors are the biggest things to come out of Africa to the entire world. And this has been made possible evidently through our diversity of sound, culture and tradition and content.” Ikezahu further revealed that the record label arm of the establishment would be announcing the official signing of two recording and performing artistes who are currently gearing up to take the Nigerian music industry by storm.
