 NSIA Insurance has kicked   launched its radio advert campaigns, NSIA Value Campaign, nationwide. According to the company in a statement, NSIA Value Campaign offers the opportunity to deliver a simple yet powerful message to a targeted group of consumers in an effort to increase awareness about the organisation, and also to communicate effectively the value of their product offerings and tailor-made services. The statement read: “The campaign has two directions: “Insurance is” and “Insurance has a new look”. ‘Insurance is’ showcases insurance as a safety net, ensuring one does not have to pay out-of-pocket when an eventuality occurs. “Insurance has a new look’ focuses on changing the perception about insurance in Nigeria. This direction speaks to the fact that NSIA Insurance is committed to providing its stakeholders with excellent customer experience, throughout their journey. “The campaign will run for five weeks on various radio stations in: Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Warri, Abuja, Onitsha, Asaba, Enugu, Kaduna and Kano. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NSIA Insurance, Ebelechukwu Nwachukwu said they have a lot to offer to our customers. “We seek to help create, protect and preserve wealth. One way we can fulfil this is by keeping our potential and existing customers in the loop about our new products and how they can benefit from them,” he added.  “Radio is ideal for targeting specific demographics and market segments. By choosing this medium, we can get to our potential customers, remain top of mind to our existing customers and ultimately change the perception about insurance in Nigeria.”
