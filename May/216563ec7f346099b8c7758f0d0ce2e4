AFRO-FUSION artiste, Daniel Benson aka Buju has said his mission statement is to push the new generation into conversation on making good music. According to the 22-year-old vocalist, he is one artiste who wants to be known for the impact he made via music. “What sets me apart from other artistes is that I am conscious of whatever material I’m putting out. I am one artiste who wants to be known for the impact he made via music,” he said. The Akwa-Ibom-born singer disclosed that he is influenced by the good works of talented artistes including Burna Boy, Drake, Buju Banton, Damian Marley, and J Hus amongst others. “My love for music started from junior secondary school where I developed the skills of writing music and doing a few rap songs, later proceeding to joining the choir and doing solo performances at Valedictory services. The love continued up to the university level and ever since my love and passions for music have grown.” Buju released his first solo single in 2018 titled ‘Catch a Vibe’ and has gone ahead to release other materials that include ‘A Day in Lagos’, ‘Spiritual,’ L’Enu amongst other songs.
