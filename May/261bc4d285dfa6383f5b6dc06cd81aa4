The Metropolitan Police has arrested a total of eight men following an investigation into online racist abuse directed at an unnamed Tottenham player, it was announced on Friday. The investigation was launched after a Spurs player was racially abused on social media following their 3-1 defeat to Manchester United in April. The abuse was detected by United’s reporting tool and then flagged to the Manchester police which resulted in arrests being made after the anonymous social media users were tracked.  “This action makes it abundantly clear that police will not stand for racist thuggery, even if it is committed online,” Detective Sergeant Matt Simpson from the Met’s public order crime team said in a statement. “The posts, all of which were on Twitter, were vulgar and were utterly unacceptable. There is no safe haven for this type of abusive behaviour and we are committed to taking decisive action to root it out.”
