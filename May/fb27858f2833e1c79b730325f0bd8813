They were about three in number.” Another victim, a native of Isuaniocha, who appeared in a video that has gone viral, said that he was attacked at Urum-Achalla Road with one woman. “That woman that was killed, I was with her that day in the same vehicle. You see this my right hand (showing it in the video), it has been condemned. It’s paralysed. “The woman was beaten to death. They dragged me into the bush. I was released when my wife paid N1 million ransom. “These were Fulani people. I was with them in the bush for three days. My hand was tied for three days and as a result, paralysis set in.”
