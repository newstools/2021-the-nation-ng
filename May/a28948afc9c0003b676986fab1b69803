Nigerian ex-Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo has been celebrating “one of the happiest days” of his life after his mother was in the stadium to see him score. Ighalo, who now plays for Saudi side Al-Shabab, netted a goal in the 5-1 rout of Al-Ainon Wednesday’s  night. In a tweet, that included a video of his mother celebrating, the 31-year-old said this was the first time that she had seen him score in his 16-year professional career. He now has six goals and three assists since he moved to Saudi Arabia from an eventful loan spell at Manchester United. His club remain second on the table with 51 points from 28 games. Ighalo moved to six-time Saudi champions Al-Shabab from Chinese outfit Shanghai Shenhua in February.
