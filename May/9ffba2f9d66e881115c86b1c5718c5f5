Former Super Eagles goalkeeper Peter Rufai believes the team’s current goalkeepers will be vital in the team’s mission to win next year’s Africa Cup of Nations. With Maduka Okoye, who played a crucial role in the team’s qualification for the tournament, assured of his number one position and others like Francis Uzoho and Daniel Akpeyi, the Super Eagles are not short of options in the goalkeeping position. Rufai, a member of the Super Eagles side that won the 1994 AFCON in Tunisia, told Soccernet.ng in a chat that the same attention placed on the strikers should be put on the goalkeepers. “I really don’t know why so much noise has made on the Super Eagles strikers banging in the goals in Europe for their respective clubs without attention been focused on the goalkeeping department,” he said. “If the strikers are banging the goals for the Super Eagles in a competition, and our goalkeepers failed to keep a clean sheet, of what benefit will that be for the team. “Yes, we have Maduka Okoye, Francis Uzoho, and a few to mention. However, are they are on the same level in terms of performance with our strikers? “They are good goalkeepers, but we need to pay attention to them so that we can get the best from them,” he concluded.
