Six persons were on Tuesday confirmed dead as three vehicles crashed on Sagamu-Benin Expressway. Mr Ahmed Umar, Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun State, confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abeokuta, the state capital. Umar said the crash involved a Mazda bus, a Toyota Sienna and a Mercedes Benz luxury bus. He said the accident was caused by wrong overtaking, speeding and loss of control on the part of the driver of the luxury bus. Umar said 39 persons were involved in the accident, comprising 25 males and 14 females, out of whom five men and one woman died. “The luxury bus hit the incoming Sienna car and the Mazda bus. The driver immediately ran away because all the occupants of the Sienna vehicle lost their lives while those in the Mazda bus sustained injuries,” he said. The sector commander said the deceased were deposited at the morgue of General Hospital Ijebu-Ode while the four persons injured were being treated in the hospital. He described the crash as avoidable and advised motorists to guard against speeding and dangerous driving, and always obey traffic rules and regulations.
