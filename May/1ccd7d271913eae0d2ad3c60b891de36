Three traders and driver have been kidnapped in Olubo village along Abeokuta-Imala-Ayetoro Road in Abeokuta North Local Government Area of Ogun State. The women were returning from the market on Tuesday when the abductors intercepted their taxi and took them away. The abductors spared two other traders who were in the same taxi with the victims. A medical doctor and a nurse were abducted in Olubo weeks ago beforeÂ  they were freed. Residents of Olubo, Obada-Idi Emi, Imeko-Afon and Ilara barricaded the road in protest of the insecurity in their communities.  They demanded the release of those kidnapped. Mrs. Akewugberu and Mrs. Rofiat Oladeinde said four gunmen forced their taxi to stop, shooting rapidly into the air. According to them, the gunmen armed with AK47 rifles and machetes abducted the driver and three women but spared a Fulani and two Hausa passengers among the passengers. They explained that the hoodlums collected their money and handsets. The Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of Operations, Ogun Police Command, Bolanle Muritala, who visited the abduction scene in a police helicopter, appealed to the residents to be calm, assuring that the police were on the trail of the abductors. The abductors were yet to contact the families of their victims at press time.
