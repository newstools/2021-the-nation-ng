Neymar has vented his fury online after being suspended for the Coupe de France final, describing the situation as “a mess”. The Paris Saint-Germain forward will not be available for the French cup final against Monaco after picking up a booking during the semi-final victory over Montpellier this week. In a heated statement posted to his Instagram page, Neymar slammed French football’s lawmakers for the suspension rules that will keep him out of competing for silverware at the end of the season.  In an Instagram story, Neymar posted a message in Portuguese which translates as: “I would like to understand the reasoning of the guy who takes care of bookings in France! That deserves applause. What a mess.” It was accompanied by three facepalm emojis. Neymar picked up a booking despite only playing four minutes of the semi-final against Montpellier, having been introduced as an 86th-minute substitute by manager Mauricio Pochettino. The Brazilian was sent on after Andy Delort’s late equaliser for Montpellier made it 2-2, with the game eventually going to penalties. PSG triumphed 6-5 in the shoot-out to progress to the final.
