The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has cautioned House of Representatives against legitimising cannabis. MURIC’s Director, Prof Ishaq Akintola, condemned the “attempt to compartmentalise Nigerians into vicious drug cartels. “We already have serious security challenges. Boko Haram has been here for more than a decade. We have home-grown kidnapping crisis. Desperate separatist movements have turned into terrorists. We have cultism-related killings in our cities and among our young students. “The security challenges we are currently facing are punishments for our recklessness. Instead of thinking of making criminal elements in the country ‘turn back from their evil’, we want to cap the edifice with the drug war. There is no gainsaying the fact that the legalisation of cannabis will be the last straw that broke the camel’s back in terms of its impact on insecurity and the last nail in the coffin of morality in Nigeria in terms of the country’s descent into the abyss of moral debauchery which began a long time ago. “Cannabis may have its benefits but the disadvantages outway the advantages. We, therefore, call on the House of Representatives to reject any attempt to smuggle the cannabis bill into the hallowed House. “This House must not become the House of Marijuana. It must remain the House of Reform, Progress and Dignity.”
