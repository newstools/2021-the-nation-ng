About 15 hoodlums on Tuesday attacked the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) office in Ohafia Local government Area of Abia State. The attack came barely 24 hours after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office in the same location was razed by yet-to-be identified persons. A source said the attackers went straight to the agencyâ€™s detention facility after gaining entry into the property. He said they probably wanted to set free detainees but saw empty cells, adding that the agency had evacuated all suspects in its custody following the attack on the INEC office. The source said no life was lost and that the attackers did not steal any weapon from its operatives. An investigation into the incident has begun, The Nation learnt.
