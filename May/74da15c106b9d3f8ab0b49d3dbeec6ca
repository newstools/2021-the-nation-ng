Terem Moffi has finished his first season in France as the second most prolific African player. Moffi, who clocks 22 today, netted 14 league goals for FC Lorient, one goal shy of Algerian Andy Delort’s 15 goals for Montpellier. Moffi had the same number of goals with Lyon’s Toko Ekambi but played fewer than the Cameroon international. Moffi helped Les Merlus to a 1-1 draw at fellow strugglers Strasbourg on Sunday to finish the season in 16th place with 42 points from 38 matches, thus securing another season in the french top flight. France football radio station, RFI, called the former Kortrijk star was the real summer signing for Christophe Pélissier’s side whose goals were crucial to the team remaining in the Ligue after three years in the lower division. “Coming from Kortrijk in Belgium, Terem Moffi was largely part of the plans of Christophe Pélissier, the coach. “Terem Moffi offered his team a victory against PSG this season, a hat-trick against Bordeaux, and braces against Monaco and Marseille. “Called up by his country for the first time, he could win his first cap on June 4 against Cameroon in a friendly in Austria. “Terem Moffi started his European career in 2017 in Lithuania. After three seasons in Ligue 2, Lorient stay on in Ligue 1 thanks in particular to Moffi.”
