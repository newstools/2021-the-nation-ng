Bayern Munich were confirmed as Bundesliga champions for the ninth straight season Saturday after Borussia Dortmund beat second-placed RB Leipzig 3-2. England winger Jadon Sancho netted twice in Dortmund’s home win, a result that meant Bayern become champions without kicking a ball before their home game against Borussia Moenchengladbach later on Saturday evening. Before they even kick off, Bayern have 71 points to Leipzig’s 64. The victory lifted Dortmund into the Champions League places, but Eintracht Frankfurt can knock them out of fourth place if they beat Mainz on Sunday. Even without star striker Erling Braut Haaland, Dortmund were 2-0 up at the start of the second half with goals by Marco Reus and Sancho. Leipzig fought back with a Lukas Klostermann header before Dani Olmo equalised only for Sancho to grab the winner with superb footwork. The clubs meet again on Thursday in the German Cup final at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium. With Haaland watching in the stands as his thigh injury continues to sideline him, Dortmund raced into the lead after only seven minutes.
