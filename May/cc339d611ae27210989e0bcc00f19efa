 Police in Ondo State said yesterday that two persons died in a clash between suspected cultists and members of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) in Owo, Owo local government area. Other sources said five persons were killed, and many injured in the confrontation, which occurred at Idasen and Ijebu area of Owo. Some residents were hit by stray bullets, it was said. Witnesses said business activities were paralysed in the area. It was reliably gathered the OPC, in its commitment to stamp out cultism, had killed two suspected cultists and burnt their houses.   The cult group of those two victims attacked OPC to avenge their members’ death. Many members of OPC including their leader reportedly fled into the bush after the clash. Chairman of the local government Olabade Adegbegi warned troublemakers to stay away from the locality. Police spokesman Tee-Leo Ikoro, who confirmed the incident, said two persons were killed and many others injured. He said security operatives have taken full control of the area. Traditional ruler of Owo, Oba Ajibade Ogunoye, the Olowo of Owo, last year threatened to curse those who refused to renounce cultism in his domain.
