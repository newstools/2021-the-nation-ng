LOSING the FA Cup final, despite a big final three games coming up, is hurting Chelsea fans who think their side should have performed much better at Wembley. Thomas Tuchel’s side lost to Arsenal in midweek, suffering a blow to their hopes of a finish in the top four. They have Liverpool breathing down their necks with Jurgen Klopp’s side possessing a game-in-hand over the Blues.

So many issues from last season still remain and need addressing.” Another added: “Tuchel has got this whole week wrong…Major doubts over top four chances now. Play your best players when it matters most. End of.” “Tuchel got it wrong today and got it wrong midweek,” a third supporter said. “Pulisic needs to start. Chilly needs to start. Put your best players on the pitch now. There’s no room for error.” A fourth fan added: “I’m broken, 29th May is the last chance to save this season.” “You can’t win a cup final with someone like Werner upfront, his decision making is awful,” another said. “Chances don’t come often in finals, every single decision matters. If Tuchel uses Timo for the Champions League final, it’s congrats to Man City.”
