Driver of an articulated vehicle Tuesday lost his life in an accident near Iruekpen on the busy Benin-Ekpoma-Auchi-Abuja highway, Edo state. The driver was said to have had a head-on collision with a truck. Witnesses disclosed that five persons were injured in the accident, which occurred when the diesel-laden tanker collided with the sand-conveying truck, leaving the driver to die on the spot. The auto crash led to heavy traffic, as the affected vehicles completely blocked the highway for some hours, making many motorists and commuters to be stranded, before the road was later cleared by combined efforts of villagers, travellers and officials of government agencies.
