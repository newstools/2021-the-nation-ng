Hospitals and schools in Rivers State had cause to smile as an oil and gas (pipelines and facilities) company, Oilserv Limited, presented educational materials and equipment to them to mark its corporate social responsibility (CSR) week. The CSR team, led by the Corporate Communications Manager Emeka Opah, donated medical items to the Woji Primary Health Center in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. The team presented a 55-inch television, two split unit airconditioners and gallons of sanitisers to the Orthopaedic Department of the University Teaching Hospital in Port Harcourt. No fewer than 10 schools in Woji and environs got educational materials from the Oilserv team. According to Opah, the CSR week was in keeping with the philanthropic vision of the Chairman of Oilserv Group, Emeka Okwuosa, an engineer. He said: “The climax of the CSR activity was the visit of the team to the Home for the Elderly in the old Port Harcourt town. The home was presented with food items, clothes, toiletries, etc. “The Reverend Sister in-charge, Mary Jane Agusiobi, was ecstatic at our visit and gifts. One of the elderlies led a very heart-rending prayer session for our Chairman and Oilserv. “The CSR week was a great opportunity to feel the pulse of the community. It provided insight into the state of schools, hospitals, and many amenities in the community we operate.”
