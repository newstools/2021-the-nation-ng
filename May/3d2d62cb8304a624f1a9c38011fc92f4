Gunmen on Saturday evening attacked the facility of Abia State Police Criminal Investigation Department located at the Ugwunchara axis of Umuahia, the Abia State capital. Sources said that the gunmen arrived the SCID facility in a Toyota Sienna with some of the gunmen who were Stark naked and others dressed in black attire with red scarf carrying AK7. The sources said that the gunmen also came with the message that they will deal with anyone that disobeys the Monday May 30th sit-at-home order. The incident which was said to have occured about 5:30pm has forced many residents of both Umuagu in Umuahia North LGA and other parts of the state capital to desert the streets. While information about the attack is still sketchy, unconfirmed reports have it that the CID building was completely razed down with suspects in their custody set free. It was gathered that few officers on ground had attempted to repel the attackers who took the police unawares, but were overpowered as the gunmen not only came in their numbers, but had a superior weapon. Until the time of filing the report, no life is reported to have been lost. However, shop owners including pubs and other event centers and eateries in Umuahia have reportedly shutdown operation. Commercial and public transportation has been abruptly suspended with many travelers using the Ugwunchara axis to enter and exit the state capital. People who had traveled to the Abia North part of the State for social events were left stranded on the Uzuakoli-Ohafia road. Information has it that vehicular movement on Enugu-Aba-Port Harcourt Expressway has been halted as people coming into Umuahia from Owerri and Aba axis of the Expressway are waiting for clearance before they can proceed into the capital. Efforts to reach the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO Geoffrey Ogbonna at the time of filing the report, failed.
