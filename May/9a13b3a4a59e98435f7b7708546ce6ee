The Sultan of Sokoto and President-General, Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, has urged Muslims to look out for the crescent (moon) of Shawwal, 1442 AH tonight. He gave the directive in a statement issued by NSCIA Deputy Secretary-General, Prof. Salisu Shehu. The sighting of the moon of Shawwal, according to Islamic tradition, ends Ramadan and ushers in Eid-al-Fitr. “If the crescent is actually sighted by informed persons on Tuesday night and His Eminence is so advised by the experts, he would address the press to declare Wednesday, May 12, as the first day of Shawwal (Eid day). “If, however, the crescent is not sighted on Tuesday night, Thursday, May 13, automatically becomes the first of Shawwal, 1442 AH (Eid day),” he said. The Sultan encouraged the faithful to keep praying for peaceful co-existence in the country.
