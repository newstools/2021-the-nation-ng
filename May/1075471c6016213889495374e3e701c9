Thirty-two years after hosting the sixth edition of the African Senior Athletics Championship, Lagos has been confirmed as the host of the 22nd edition billed to hold on June 23 to 27 at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere. After a meeting on Monday in Cairo, Egypt between President of Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) Kalkaba Malboum, and Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare, Lagos was affirmed to host the crème-de-la-crème of African athletics in an event that will serve as the last qualifying event for African athletes for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Auxiliary support will be provided at the National Stadium, Surulere and the Yaba College of Technology, Yaba, both in Lagos during the five-day championship. This will be the third time Nigeria will be hosting the Championship after Lagos (1989) and Asaba (2018) hosted the sixth and the 21st editions respectively. Nigeria has now tied with Egypt as the two African countries to host the championships thrice since the inaugural edition in 1979 in Dakar, Senegal.
