Kelechi Iheanacho marked his Premier League player of the month nomination with another goal, but it was not enough to prevent Leicester from suffering a shock defeat at home to Newcastle. Newcastle United derailed Leicester City’s bid to qualify for next season’s Champions League with a 4-2 win on Friday that all but secured their place in the Premier League. Defeat left Leicester third, two points in front of Chelsea and five ahead of West Ham, with both London clubs having a game in hand over the Foxes. This reverse came five years to the day since Leicester received the Premier League trophy, having started the 2015⁄16 season as 5,000/1 rank outsiders to be crowned English champions. Newcastle’s win saw them move 12 points clear of the relegation zone, just one shy from safety with three games remaining. Joe Willock, on loan from Arsenal, fired Newcastle in front in the 22nd minute at the King Power Stadium as he scored in his fourth successive top-flight game for the Magpies.  And the visitors doubled their lead before half-time with a rare goal from Paul Dummett. Marc Albrighton and Kelechi Iheanacho however, both scored inside the final 10 minutes for Leicester before the Foxes were beaten eight days out from their FA Cup final against Chelsea. Meanwhile, Iheanacho has been nominated for the English Premier League Player of the Month award for April 2021. Iheanacho is up against Liverpool fullback Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Stuart Dallas (Leeds United), Mason Greenwood (Manchester United), Jesse Lingard (West Ham), Matheus Pereira (West Brom), Allan Saint-Maximin (Newcastle United) and Chris Wood (Burnley) for the award. The votes from the public will be combined with those of the 20 club captains and a panel of football experts to decide the winner, who will be revealed next week.
