Paris St-Germain won the French Cup for the sixth time in seven years by beating Monaco at the Stade de France. Mauro Icardi put Mauricio Pochettino’s side ahead after 19 minutes, slotting in from Kylian Mbappe’s pass after he had pounced on a defensive error. Mbappe then sealed victory for the 14-time winners with a delightful chipped finish nine minutes from the end. It is PSG’s second trophy under former Tottenham boss Pochettino, following the Trophee des Champions in January. Defending champions PSG are one point behind leaders Lille going into the final round of Ligue 1 fixtures as they chase a league and cup double. They visit 16th-placed Brest on Sunday at 20:00 BST, while Lille are away to mid-table Angers. BBC
