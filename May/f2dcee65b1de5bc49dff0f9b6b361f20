An ex-militant leader and former commander of the Bakassi Freedom Fighters (BFF), ‘Gen.’ Franklin Duduku, has hailed the reforms in the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP). He said ex-agitators no longer blocked roads to protest unpaid monthly allowances. Duduku hailed the Interim Administrator of Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), Col. Milland Dixion Dikio (retd), for carrying out the reforms to guarantee prompt payment of the monthly stipends of ex-agitators. Speaking yesterday in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Duduku said the timely payment of the stipends was one of the positive steps taken by Dikio to stabilise the Niger Delta and sustain peace in the area. He said before the current amnesty boss came on board, ex-agitators usually blocked major roads in the region, including sections of the East-West Road, to protest before the amnesty office would release their stipends. Duduku recalled that in most cases, the amnesty office owed ex-agitators arrears of stipends, causing unrest among youths. But he said such ugly narrative had changed because Dikio fulfilled his promise by paying ex-agitators their stipends on the 25th of every month.
