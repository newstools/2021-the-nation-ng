Liverpool’s Nigerian striker Taiwo Awoniyi has been granted a work permit to play in the UK – six years after signing for the club. The 23-year-old joined Liverpool on a long-term deal in August 2015 from Nigeria’s Imperial Academy, but has never played for The Reds due to his inability to secure a work permit. It means Awoniyi, who is currently on a seventh loan spell outside of the United Kingdom at German side Union Berlin is now eligible to be included in the Liverpool squad for next season. “It’s been a long process but finally [Taiwo] Awoniyi can now focus on his career either at Liverpool or somewhere in England,” a top official at Imperial Academy told BBC Sport Africa. “He has the ambition to play in the Premier League and hopefully, he can do that next season.” Fit-again Awoniyi, who has a contract with Liverpool until June 2023, scored five goals in 20 appearances for Union Berlin despite an injury-blighted campaign in the Bundesliga. Since becoming a Red, the forward has enjoyed loan spells with then German second-tier club FSV Frankfurt, Dutch side NEC Nijmegen, Belgian outfits Royal Excel Mouscron (twice) KAA Gent and Mainz in order to attract interest from national selectors and gain a work permit. Under-17 World Cup winner with Nigeria in 2013, Awoniyi has represented the West African country at all youth levels.
