Top American golf company, Total Golf Construction USA, handling the construction of Bayelsa State Golf Estate, now known as Henry Seriake Dickson Golf Estate, is committed to delivering a world-class golf course in the state. Vice President of Total Golf USA, Jeff Brewster, said in a statement   yesterday that the construction of the gigantic golf estate is 80 per cent completed. Brewster said the golf estate was awarded in 2012 by the former Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Seriake Dickson, and they started the designs and building of the golf section in 2012. Shedding light on the construction, the country representative of Total Golf USA in Nigeria, Sopirinye Jaja, said the project was supposed to have been completed in 2015-2016 but for some unforeseen circumstances. Jaja said the project, when completed would help drive sports tourism in the state, noting that many professional golfers in neighbouring Rivers State are from Bayelsa State. He said: “When finished, the Golf Course will be the first PGA standard 18 hole golf course in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital. “Sixty per cent of professional golfers in neighbouring Rivers State are from Bayelsa. When completed, Bayelsa State could replace Rivers State as home of the PGA tournaments in the Niger Delta.” Recently, former President Goodluck Jonathan visited the Golf Course and expressed his admiration for the work done so far by the Bayelsa State government while Governor Douye Diri also expressed the commitment of his administration to completing the world-class golf project very soon. Diri, a former Commissioner for Sports and Youth Development in the state, said his government placed much premium on sports infrastructure and development.
