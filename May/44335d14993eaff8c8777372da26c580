By OLUSHOLA  RICKETTS  Another side of former Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, as family man and a lovely father came to the fore during the week, when his baby girl turned one year. Ramadan is known to be the ninth month of the Islamic calendar observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting, prayer, reflection and community. But despite that, the former Emir still found time to celebrate his daughter.  The family members came together in celebration of Princess Halimatu Saadiyya Rafeeqah’s birthday.  In a cheery atmosphere, food, drinks and cakes were in abundance. From the pictures shared on social media, it was obvious that the family had limitless fun. Rafeeqah is the daughter of Sanusi’s pretty fourth wife, Sa’adatu Barkindo Mustafa.  Her birthday party was attended by members of the family, including the three wives of the former Emir and friends. Sanusi, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), got married to Sa’adatu on September 25, 2015. His three other wives are Sadiya, Maryam and Rakiya.
