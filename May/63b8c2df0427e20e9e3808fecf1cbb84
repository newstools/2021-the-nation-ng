 Ekiti State Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi has suspended the Provost, College of Health and Technology, Ijero-Ekiti, Dr. Cecilia Adebayo, over fumigation that led to the collapse of about 100 students. Health Commissioner Dr. Banji Filani has refuted an allegation that two students died after inhaling chemicals during the fumigation. A statement by Governor Fayemi’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, said the provost was asked to go on suspension to allow investigations into the circumstances surrounding the controversial  fumigation. According to the statement, Adebayo’s suspension is without prejudice to the outcome of a meeting of the college’s Governing Council slated for next week. It disclosed that officials of the Federal Fire Services, who carried out the fumigation, have been directed to report at their office in Abuja. The statement said Governor Fayemi has set up an eight-member panel to investigate the incident and unravel the circumstances culminating in the sudden collapse of the students. The panel is to be chaired by Dr. Filani, while Mr. Isaac Okeowo, the director, Special Duties, Cabinet Office, will serve as secretary. Other members of the panel are Dr. Olabimpe Aderiye, the Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology; Commissioner for Environment Princess Iyabo Fakunle-Okhiemen.
