No fewer than 20,000 poor and vulnerable households spread across seven local government areas in Lagos State would benefit from the COVID-19 Rapid Response Register (RRR) Cash Transfer, the Coordinator of the Lagos State Operations Coordinating Unit (LASOCU) of the National Social Safety Nets Register (NSR), Mrs. Oluwakemi Adedeji, has said. In a statement issued yesterday, Mrs. Adedeji said the beneficiaries would receive the benefit through their respective bank account for a period of six months. She explained that the RRR is a Federal Government’s social intervention programme under Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development in partnership with the World Bank. She said: “The selection is based on an earlier data gathered around some of the local governments in the state, where poor and very vulnerable households have been collated using the global standard of poverty index and availability of resources. “They are from Ijede ward 1 in Ikorodu Local Government, Abomiti ward in Epe Local Government, Irewe and Tafi wards in Ojo Local Government and Ajido, Ikoga and Iya Afin wards in Badagry Local Government.” The disbursements to beneficiaries in the seven wards, she added, is coming on the heels of a pilot disbursements earlier carried out in two wards – Ijede II and Agura/Iponmi in Ikorodu Local Government, bringing to nine, the total number of wards in five local governments touched by the programme. People on the pilot scheme, according to her, are already receiving N5,000 monthly. Mrs. Adedeji, who said the process is continuing, said qualified households from the benefitting council areas would start receiving short message services (SMS) for enrolment into the programme. The LASOCU chief implored applicants to be quick to respond to the SMS as they come to enable enumerators to meet them at their homes for proper identification and documentations.
