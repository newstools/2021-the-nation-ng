Imo State Hope Uzodimma has described the death of Nigeria’s former Chief of Defence Staff, Lt. Gen. Joshua Dogonyaro as a big loss to the country in the general and the military community in particular. The late Gen. Dogonyaro, one time Chief of Defence Staff to late Military Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha, reportedly died on Thursday at the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) in Plateau State, aged 80. His son, Joseph said Gen. Dogonyaro had been sick until recently when he was struck by stroke and was rushed to JUTH. Governor Uzodimma in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser, Oguwike Nwachuku, described Gen. Dogonyaro’s death as not just a rude shock but a big loss to Nigeria, his State, Plateau, and the Military, given that his experience was still highly needed when he died. He said Gen. Dogonyaro gave his all and best to Nigeria as a professional officer of the Nigerian Army and a gentleman, and that the country will miss him sorely. Governor Uzodimma commiserated with the entire Dogonyaro family, the Government and people of Plateau State and the Nigerian Army over the colossal loss and urged them to have solace in the fact that Gen. Dogonyaro made a mark in the society that cannot be forgotten in a haste. On behalf of the Government and good people of Imo State, Governor Uzodimma prayed to God to grant the soul of Gen. Dogonyaro a peaceful repose.
