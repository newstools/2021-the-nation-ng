Twitter influencer Pamilerin Adegoke aka as Dr Pam Pam or Pamilerin Omo Iya Ologi seemed to be working on a “revenge body.” The twitter influencer might just be reigniting the longtime feud he had with singer, Peruzzi years after he was physically assaulted. In June 2019, Peruzzi reportedly slapped Pamilerin and caused him facila injury over a statement he made about him on social media. Social media users had urged Pamilerin to sue the singer for assault but he chose not to escalate the issue. However, years after the incident went viral, Pamilerin has teased the “Majesty” crooner with his revenge body and jokingly challenged him. The social media personality shared a photo of himself in a gym-like setting with profuse sweat on his body and tagged the “Majesty” crooner. Reacting, Peruzzi urged him not to be deceived by people advising him to move forward with the challenge “Pam Pam, No Let Anybody Deceive You Oh”, the 30BG member wrote. Pamilerin in his response jokingly referred to Peruzzi as a “Bully”.
