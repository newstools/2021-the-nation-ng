In a solidarity visit to Imo Governor Hope Uzodimma at the Government House, Owerri, the Forum, in a statement by Abia State Caretaker Chairman/Chairman southeast APC State Chairmen Forum, Enugu Caretaker Chairman/Secretary, Imo State Caretaker Chairman, Chief Marcellaneous Nlemigbo, Ebonyi State Caretaker Chairman, Hon. Stanley Okoro and Anambra Caretaker Chairman, Chief Basil Ejidike, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to disregard political jobbers, sycophants and create avenues for positive and fruitful dialogue with the Governors and other opinion leaders for the purpose of charting a new and acceptable political agenda for the nation. “We wish to identify with and commend the fearless and patriotic positions and stand of the Southern Nigerian Governors Forum and call on our courageous and patriotic President Muhammadu Buhari to resist and reject the opinion of Prince jesters, political jobbers, sycophants and create avenue for positive and fruitful dialogue with the governors and other opinion leaders for the purpose of charting a new and acceptable political agenda for our nation.” They called on other Nigerians from all divides to sheath their swords, exercise restraint, place the nation above individual interest as “we explore the principle of positive dialogue and round table negotiations to save this generation and generations yet unborn.” The forum also expressed worry and total condemnation of the wanton destruction of property, loss of lives and trivialisation of governance by the attempted arson of Governor Uzodimma’s home. “We must commend the governor for his show of maturity, humane disposition and general sense of responsibility which reduced the collateral damage both in human and material losses in the face of brazen and unreasonable provocation by enemies of the state. “We also commend your quality, purposeful leadership and your infrastructural development revolution. We are proud of the APC governments in Imo and Ebonyi states that have become yardsticks of assessing the performance of other governments in South East and Nigeria in general.”
