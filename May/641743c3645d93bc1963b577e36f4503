Talented singer and songwriter Korede Bello has released a brand new single titled “Fine fine”. The singer reveals it’s the “official pretty girl anthem”. This follows his first two music releases of the year “Real Man” and “Leg Work,” for which he released a video for the single “Real Man.” This new hit is quite different from the others in that it moves at a slower pace and is on the cool side of jams.  In this song, the Mavin Records vocalist talks about nobody being finer than his woman, making it a love song. It is a dedication to singer’s mythical alluring partner, who is also unique and pure. “Fine Fine”was produced by DJ Coublon. Bello is best known for his hit single “Godwin“, a semi-gospel and pop song which became a national anthem and topped many music charts across Nigeria.
