Three relatives (all males) have been crushed to death by a truck along the Akure-Idanre in Akure South local government area. The deceased were riding on a motorcycle when the truck rammed into them. They all died on the spot. Miffed by the incident, other okada riders and residents in the area set the truck ablaze. It was the timely intervention of the police that reportedly saved the truck driver. Spokesman for the Ondo Federal Road Safety Corps, Abiola Fadumo, who confirmed the accident, said the presence of policemen helped to calm the situation. Last week, truck drivers clashed with okada riders in Akure after one of their trucks was set ablaze. An okada rider and his passengers had died after ramming into a stationary truck along High Court road. Truck drivers and owners protested the next day blocking major streets in Akure while demanding compensation for the burnt truck.
