Following Coach Gennaro Gattuso is hopeful that the  scoring prowess of Victor Osimhen would be handy to  seal his side’s  Champions League spot despite the ankle injury sustained by Belgian Dries Mertens in Napoli’s 4-1 away win over Spezia. With three matches left to end the 2020/2021 Serie A season and Napoli still on top four, Mertens’ injury is a setback for Gattuso as the Belgian will miss Napoli’s next tie against Udinese tomorrow. According to Corriere Del Mezzogiorno, Gattuso is expected to speak with Osimhen, who will have to pay attention to another aspect in the next two league matches with Udinese and Fiorentina: “The problem of Mertens must warn Osimhen who, with yesterday’s warning, gets a warning. If he gets a yellow card against Udinese or Fiorentina, he would be forced to stop. A sin to avoid, Gattuso will catechize Osimhen this morning, when Napoli will start preparing for Tuesday night’s match against Udinese.” Meanwhile, Osimhen’s agent William D’Avila, told Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli that the Super Eagles striker is grateful to Napoli for their support. “Victor is happy for yesterday’s victory, he feels more and more at ease in this team and then when you score a goal everything is easier. He is proud to wear the Napoli shirt and is keen to thank the club for waiting for him,” D’Avila said.
