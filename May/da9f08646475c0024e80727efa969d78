SIR: The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, in a recent interview stated that some highly placed individuals are being profiled for prosecution for financing terrorism. The interview came barely one month after the government arrested some operators of Bureau De Change for alleged transaction in funds believed to have come from the syndicate group of terrorism financers. Prior to this development, the United Arab Emirates had paraded some Nigerians suspected of financing terrorism in Nigeria. Since the emergence of Boko Haram in the last decade and their attendant destructive consequences in the northeast, the terror group has remained invincible. Although, credit must be given to President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration for technically defeating the murderous group, the terror group seemed to have regrouped with greater ferocity with havoc being daily wreaked on defenceless communities and security formations in the country. After Geidam town in Yobe State reportedly fell to the group, there were reports of the group allegedly wooing or enticing youths with N20,000, to join them. This report indicates Boko Haram actually uses money for recruitment. Who provides them with these funds? I think here lies the role of the financers. There is indeed some influential personalities who are sponsoring terrorism in the country. Evidence abounds on how the group is well funded and armed with modern weapons that are superior to the ones possessed by our military personnel. The posers begging for answers are: What do these terrorism financers want to achieve? Why has government taken this long to expose them and their evil activities? Answers to these questions will feed our curiosity. When Malami stated that the financers have been identified, Nigerians quickly turned their eyes to see who they are. The government should publish their names and prosecute them according to the laws of the land. Pambegua, Kaduna State
