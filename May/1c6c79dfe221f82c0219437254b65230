Embattled Nollywood actor Olanrewaju James, popularly called Baba Ijesha, who was granted bail on Monday after 25 days in detention is still in police custody, The Nation has learnt. The Nation reports the comic actor was alleged to have molested a 14-year-old foster daughter of Comedian Princess. Baba Ijesha’s lawyer, Adesina Ogunlana had alleged that the Lagos police prevented his client’s freedom because they wanted to monetise his release. But reacting, the Lagos police public relations officer (PPRO), Muyiwa Adejobi said that Baba Ijesha’s failure to immediately meet his bail terms informed his continued detention. He said, “It’s not true. No one is monetising his release. He has not met with the bail conditions. Anyone making such an allegation is mischievous or seeking undue public attention “Everyone involved in his case knows he has not met the bail conditions. Ijesha’s case is purely a legal matter and there are procedures to follow. The command is not keeping him but the law “He who alleges must prove. However, the man alleging is not Ijesha’s lawyer. Find out,” he added.
