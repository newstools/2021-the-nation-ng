The chairperson of the Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode has commended the La Liga Women’s Department for their consistent drive to develop women’s football in Nigeria and by extension in Africa. Falode was speaking at the recent NWFL/ LaLiga ‘Show Your Other Side Challenge’ held at the Elegbeta Sports Ground, Apongbon, Lagos Island on Sunday. “We thank LaLiga for its strategic partnership in building the blocks of making the Nigerian Women Football League strong and a force in Women Football League in the world,” Falode said. “One of such collaborations is responsible for this event, and with many more purposeful relationships like we have with LaLiga, we’ll go further towards our goal.” She urged football stakeholders and fans to key into the NWFL as the women’s league evolves into a global brand, admitting it would take time before getting to the finished product. “The NWFL is  building the blocks of confidence of the Nigeria football lovers to buy into our vision of  evolving into a global league brand eventually. We won’t get there all at once,” Falode added. It’s taken so much to get to where we are today, and it’ll take so much more to arrive at our desired destination. This is why it is important to get the cooperation and collaboration of all stakeholders-  the fans are a major part of the collaboration.” She concluded.
