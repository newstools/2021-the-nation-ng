Despite doubt over his availability for the final of the UEFA Europa League against Manchester United on account of injury he copped in the second leg semi-final against Arsenal, Samuel Chukwueze is already dreaming of his first continental  title with Villarreal. The Super Eagles striker was stretched out during the second leg of the semifinal tie at Emirates Stadium against Arsenal believing cuddling the trophy would be a dream comes true. “I’d like you to tell me that I am going to win the UEFA Europa League, just tell me that! I want to win the UEFA Europa League,” he enthused in an interview with La Liga Livescore. The former Golden Eaglets star, who is spending his third season with the La Liga side, admitted that playing with the Yellow Submarines has raised his game. He said: “I think my game has changed so much, coming from Nigeria to come and play in Europe at Villarreal CF. Before I saw football as entertainment just to play how I want, attack and dribble, to entertain the fans. “Now, I think I understand what it means to be tactically disciplined, knowing when to attack, when to defend. I think my overall understanding of the game has changed a huge amount,” he added.
