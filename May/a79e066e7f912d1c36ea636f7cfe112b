Former governor of the lmo State Rochas Okorocha has denied giving the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) N500 million when he was in government. Okorocha said that the current Government was rattled and cowed by his superlative outing on Channels’ Television, Sunday night, and came up with the story that he gave IPOB N500 million, while he was governor. The former governor now a senator who spoke through his Media Adviser, Sam Onwuemeodo said that those who watched the programme while it was on would attest or confirm that Okorocha had, at no time, claimed that he gave IPOB N500 million. He said Okorocha only explained intelligently, how he managed the group, using God-given wisdom and knowledge, to ensure that Imo enjoyed maximum peace throughout the eight years he had held sway, as the Executive Governor of Imo State. “Senator Okorocha had talked about how he released N250 million, on two occasions, totaling N500 million, for empowerment programme, for Militants in the oil areas of Ohaji/Egbema/Oguta, who had accepted his appeal to embrace peace and surrender their arms. And that was how total peace returned to those areas. “And he also enlisted thousands of them and other youths, into Imo Security Network, (ISN), Imo Civil Guard, Niger Delta Security Network, Youth Must Work Programme and so on, with their stipends being N15, 000 or N20, 000 each, monthly. Okorocha never claimed to have given IPOB N500 million. The Imo government is an expert in chasing shadows, and passing buck or looking for scapegoats. Okorocha’s appearance on Channels’ TV and how he handled the questions didn’t go down well with lmo government and its agents. They decided, therefore, to inject a virus into that exciting outing. “To say the least, the government in lmo, wants to prevail by strength,” he stated.
