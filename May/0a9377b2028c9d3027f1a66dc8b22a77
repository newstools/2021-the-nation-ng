  Labour has asked the Federal Government to ensure the protection of Nigerians and consumers. It asked the government not to transfer its inefficieny on the poor in the name of subsidy removal. It noted that massive petroleum products importation is a certain pathway to economic bankruptcy. According to Labour, the government should ensure that the four refineries are working in optimal capacity. President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Ayuba Wabba, said the position of Labour on subsidy removal had not changed, asking: is there subsidy? “The position of Labour has remained very consistent: is there subsidy? What is the subsidy about? “In all circumstances, Nigerians and consumers must be protected against policies that we have not been able to get right and that is why we are in this quagmire.  “We reiterate that the policies of successive governments on our downstream petroleum sub sector reeks of opacity, double standards, corruption and an obstinate desire to transfer the cost of governance failures and inefficiencies to the people. “The Nigeria Labour Congress continues to shout itself hoarse that the roadmap of massive petroleum products importation is a certain pathway to economic bankruptcy. “No developing country would spend her scarce foreign exchange on importation of refined petroleum products as we do and remain solvent. “We are the only OPEC country that is importing refined products. It is because of the inefficiency of governments – both past and present –  that we are not able to fix our refineries. “Therefore, at this very critical times, it is very clear that Nigerians also can no longer shoulder this burden because the implications are also grievous. “We also warn against further increase in the price of imported refined petroleum products under the guise of removal of under-recovery cost or the withdrawal of the so-called petroleum subsidies.”
