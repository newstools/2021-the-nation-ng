Commercial motorcyclists known as Okada riders on Saturday clashed with truck drivers after a motorcyclist rammed into a stationary truck on Friday night. The motorcyclist and his passenger died on the spot, The Nation learnt. The incident infuriated other Okada riders who vandalised and set the truck ablaze. The Okada riders were said to have been angered by the fact that the truck driver did not put any caution sign on the road to indicate danger ahead. Other truck drivers mobilised on Saturday morning and started attacking any Okada rider found along the High Court road area in Akure where the incident occurred. More than five Okada riders were injured in the attacks while the truck drivers blocked the roads in the area protesting the burnt truck. Ondo Government officials led by Senior Special Assistant to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Security Matters, Jimoh Dojumo visited the scene and called for a halt to hostilities while the investigation is carried out.
