Camping of  home-based athletes ahead of the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics will get underway on Monday, an official of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development disclosed yesterday. Simon Ebhojiaye, the ministry’s Director of Federations and Elite Athletes Department (FEAD), said in a statement that they had finalised all arrangements about the camping. “According to our schedule for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, athletes in 10 sports events will be camped  in Abuja, Lagos, Port Harcourt and Yenagoa from Monday. ”This means that, with  just a few weeks to the official commencement  of the Tokyo Olympics, our  countdown has commenced with camping   for the home-based. ”This is where athletes are expected to intensify their readiness for podium success in Tokyo, while we are also monitoring the performances of  the foreign-based ones closely,” he said. Ebhojiaye further said Abuja would play host to athletes in athletics, canoeing, rowing, weightlifting, para-athletics and taekwondo. ”Those to be camped in Lagos are the athletes in para-powerlifting and para table tennis, while those in wrestling are to be camped in Yenagoa and those of badminton  in Port Harcourt.” He pointed out that the ministry decided that Team Nigeria should participate at the Olympics in only 10 events where the country has  competitive  advantage. The ministry official also noted that the athletes’ camping was a fulfilment  of the promise to organise  a 90-day Olympics camping. “The first phase camping held  for 14 days in March, and this one now is the longest  camping period organised for the Olympics and it is  expected to lead to a medals-haul for Nigeria in Tokyo,” Ebhojiaye said.
