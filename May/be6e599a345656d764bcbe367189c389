Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said a Manchester United win over Villarreal in the Europa League final could be a “stepping stone for a big future”. United face Villarreal in Gdansk, Poland, today. Solskjaer, a Champions League winner with United as a player, has yet to win a trophy since taking charge of the club in 2018-19. “This is a team that we’ve rebuilt in the last few years. Hopefully this is the start of something more,” he said. United have not won a major trophy for four years, but Solskjaer said he was “quietly confident” of beating Villarreal, who finished seventh in Spain’s La Liga in 2020-21. Meanwhile, Super Eagles winger Samuel Chukwueze could be just the second Nigerian after Alex Iwobi to score in a European club competition final when Villarreal take on Manchester United in the Europa League final on Wednesday night. Iwobi scored Arsenal’s consolation goal in the 4-1 loss to Chelsea in the Europa League final at the Olympic Stadium, Baku, two years ago. Chukwueze now has the chance to do the same- although he would be hoping for a different result tonight Villarreal are going for their first major European trophy, while United will be aiming to win their second Europa League title Should the Yellow Submarines triumph, Chukwueze would be the sixth Nigerian to win the Europa League. Kanu Nwankwo and Taribo West are the first two Nigerians to win the competition, winning it with Inter Milan in 1998. Chid Odiah also won it with CSKA Moscow in 2005 before John Mikel Obi and Victor Moses both won it with Chelsea in 2013.
