Victor Osimhen has been tipped to lead the attack of Napoli when the Coach Gennaro Gattuso-tutored side visit Spezia in a Serie A tie tomorrow. Osimhen  has scored in the last three matches for  Napoli and Italian legend Bruno Giordano believes with his present form, the Nigerian has established himself as Gattuso’s  preferred marksman. Giordano, who was questioning the huge money Napoli paid to acquire Osimhen from Lille has been convinced by the Nigerian. “I am convinced that Osimhen will be Gattuso’s ace in the hole, I see him in great condition. He is a driver, he fights on every ball. We will have to work on it on a technical level because he can improve a lot,” Giordano told La Gazzetta dello Sport. In  a related development, , La Gazzetta dello Sport also claimed  Osimhen as the front leader for Napoli. “Participation in the Champions League would raise the odds of the team in general. For Osimhen, however, there will be an all-blue future. With Lozano and Zielinski, Osimhen will form the starting point for Napoli who will come. And, apparently, Spalletti’s engagement will give clearer indications on the project to come,” the paper wrote. “His first Neapolitan season will be archived with some perplexity, Osimhen has counted, so far, only 20 appearances in the league and eight  goals to his credit.” Meanwhile Osimhen has received the green light to return to action at Spezia tomorrow  after he suffered a nasty head injury last weekend. The injury forced the striker out of the home game against Cagliari but has since resumed full training with Gazzetta dello Sport now reporting he has got the all-clear to play tomorrow  and will again lead the Napoli attack.
