The Nigerian Air Force is set to establish a new, bigger base in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital which will serve Southwest states in addition to that in Lagos. The Deputy Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Air force, Hon. Adigun Abass (aka Agboworin),  revealed this in an interview with reporters at his empowerment programme in Ibadan at the weekend. Abass, who is representing Ibadan North East/ South East Federal Constituency, empowered over 1,000 constituents with working capital for traders, 30 motorcycles, 65 grinding machines, 35 hair dryers, 35 sewing machines and two fully equipped ambulances estimated at N90 million. Adigun hinted that citing of a new, bigger Air Force base in the capital city was already in the works. He said the state government has already provided the large expanse of land for the base in Ajia village area along Ibadan-Ife Road in Ona-Ara Local Government of the capital city. He explained that the base will be far bigger than the existing one in Akobo area of Ibadan which has been choked by residential buildings. His words: “When we talk about the AirForce base, we have one in Ibadan now in Akobo but we are planning a new one.  As you know that the former Chief of Air Staff came here last year and he mentioned  that there would  be another AirForce base in Ibadan. We have a location for the that already. It will be somewhere in Ajia, Ibadan. It’s in process. It will be a very mighty one that will be for the Southwest region.” Adigun commended Governor Seyi Makinde for his giant strides in the last two years, adding that he has been providing enabling environment for lawmakers to impact their constituents.
