The Minister: ” Congratulations to Ese Brume for her impressive performances at the Sandiago Chula Vista Festival, she was simply fantastic , cool, confident and composed. “Her performance was not only fantastic, but a good motivation for others as Team Nigeria continues the build- up to the Tokyo Olympics. “This feat would send the right signal to the world that Nigerian athletes mean business and would not be pushovers at the Olympics. “We have provided all support to our team to actualize the dream of podium success at
acthe Olympics”, the Minister assured. Brume leapt 7.17m to beat Olympics champion Britney Reese and Chantley Malone to the 2nd and 3rd positions. Her performance erased the 25 year record of her compatriot Chioma Ajunwa who leapt 7.12 to win gold medal at the Atlanta ’96 Olympics.
