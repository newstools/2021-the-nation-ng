Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume (Borno South) has raised the alarm over the resurgence of Boko Haram militancy in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Ndume stated this while briefing reporters on a Bill which seeks to establish a Federal College of Education Gwoza, Borno State, sponsored by him which passed second reading on the floor of the Senate. He, however, said the resurgence of Boko Haram activities should not stop the establishment of more educational institutions in Borno South, which, he said, had existed without a higher institution of learning despite its size and population. Ndume said: “Last week, 30 soldiers were killed in Mainok on the highway. Yesterday (Monday) just 30km from Maiduguri, the town was overrun by Boko Haram. “It took concerted efforts of the armed forces but we lost a major and two soldiers. In Rann Local Government, the same thing happened. “The problem we are facing in Borno and, to some extent, in Yobe and Adamawa, is that the insurgency is resurging again and that is a matter of concern. “Part of the solution is not to give up and not to show the insurgents that Nigerians are overwhelmed but to show that despite their terrorist acts and their stance against western education, more institutions would be established.” The proposed institution, according to Ndume, aims to bring quality change in education by focusing on teacher education through teaching and learning innovations.
