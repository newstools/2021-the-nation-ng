Victor Osimhen will take the Italian Serie A by storm next season following the appointment of “top” coach Luciano Spalletti, according to the player’s agent. Player agent William D’Avilla said he believes that the favoured 4-2-3-1 formation of the experienced Spalletti will bring out the best in the Super Eagles striker. “It will be great for the team to have a top coach like him (Spalletti),” he told Radio Kiss Kiss.“4-2-3-1 will be the formation and Victor will be the offensive force.” Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has also preferred the 4-2-3-1 formation with which Osimhen has also thrived. Osimhen scored 10 goals in his debut season in Serie A despite injuries, Coronavirus infection and some suggestions that Napoli have not played to his strengths. Napoli narrowly missed out on playing Champions League football next season on the final day of the season last Sunday. “He is disappointed Napoli did not qualify (for Champions League), but the Europa League is also a prestigious tournament,” D’Avilla revealed. “What happened last Sunday (1-1 home draw with Verona) was incredible, Victor was sure they could beat Verona.” He said Osimhen will stay put at Napoli. “He will be in Napoli of course, there are no other destinations,” he said.
