 A socio-political group, Niger Delta Conscience Coalition, has described as an affront to youths of Akwa Ibom State the recent protest by Ijaw youths at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) office in Uyo, the state capital. The group said the fact that Ijaw youths crossed their territory to Akwa Ibom to protest against the Niger Delta Affairs Minister, Senator Godswill Akpabio, demanding that he inaugurates a substantive board for the NDDC, could spark off an ethnic war.  In a release signed by the President, Niger Delta Conscience Coalition, Mr. Aniefiok Obot and Secretary, John Jumbo, made available to journalists in Uyo yesterday, the group said such a move would only breed more irresponsible persons and groups in the region. The group therefore urged Ijaw Coalition of Youths and every other concerned interest in the struggle for a better Niger Delta to keep the peace and avoid creating any atmosphere or environment that would become detrimental to peaceful coexistence and overall development of the region.
