 Davido’s father, Adedeji Adeleke, seems to have taken the dance baton from his younger brother, Senator Ademola Adeleke, after he was spotted grooving recently. Adeleke’s family is known for their exploits in music, business and politics. While Davido is the biggest singer in the family, Senator Ademola also knows how to steal the show with his dancing moves. But during the recent convocation ceremony of Senator Ademola in the United States of America, Davido’s father showed the other side of him that many didn’t know. Tagged as a serious or nonsense businessman, Adeleke was seen dancing to a Kizz Daniel’s music. He was indeed in a party mood as he threw caution to the wind while enjoying himself.  It will be recalled that Adeleke didn’t initially want his son to pursue a career in music but all his efforts were abortive. David was quoted saying he was often arrested by the police, through his father, in his early days in the music industry. The billionaire father was upset that he dropped out of Oakwood University in Alabama, US, to return home to pursue a music career. Ever since Adeleke’s wife, Dr. Vero Adeleke, died on March 6, 2003, the Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Holdings Limited has not been romantically linked to any woman.
