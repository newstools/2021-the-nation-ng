Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi has blamed past leaders for the current insecurity in the country. He said past leaders failed to address the future of youths. Umahi spoke on Thursday during an interview on Channels TV Programme Politics Today, monitored by The Nation. He said the current administration should not be blamed for the heightened insecurity in the country, as the reasons are ‘systematic’. “When people talk about the recent insecurity in our country, I keep saying that the insecurity did not just develop overnight,” he said. “It has been a result of the failure of our past leaders to address the future of our youths. And this is the truth. So it’s not a question of blaming Mr. President or blaming governors or blaming APC or PDP; it is systematic and it has been there for a very long time. “I think we must deploy sincerity in our approach; we must deploy consultation, wisdom and prayers. If all these are put together, I am sure that the insecurity in the country will be a thing of the past.” He said the current state of insecurity in his region has been heightened by secessionist agitations, the problem of ‘foreign’ herdsmen who invaded the region and the general rise in the cases of cultism and armed robbery. Umahi, however, advocated the rehabilitation and reintegration of young people who have gone into crime into the society.
