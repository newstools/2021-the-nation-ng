The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday advised all Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors to defect to the ruling party. APC Secretary Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, in a statement to welcome Cross River Governor Ben Ayade, urged PDP Governors to take a cue from the new defector and abandon the ‘sinking vessel’. Akpanudoedehe, who described PDP as a dead party, urged the remaining Governors in the opposition party to leave it for a living and thriving APC. The APC scribe said: “The All Progressives Congress (APC) congratulates the Governor of Cross River State, His Excellency Ben Ayade for his wise and timely decision to leave a dead party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for a living and thriving party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). “We commend the patriotic disposition and judgement that shaped Governor Ayade’s decision to join forces with President Muhammadu Buhari to build a better Nigeria as a member of the APC . “The APC is advising the other governors who are stranded in the sinking wreckage of the PDP to exercise the best option of abandoning that vessel.” Commending Ayade, the party scribe said: “The APC notes with satisfaction that Governor Ayade has always been an APC man at heart given the humane and progressive manner in which he managed the affairs of Cross River State. “The people of Cross River State will now enjoy more developmental initiatives based on the APC values of delivering dividends of democracy designed to improve the wellbeing of the people.” The APC observed the total lack of internal democracy, which turned the PDP into a one-man show, has caused frustration and alienated PDP Governors and legislators who are hardly consulted in the way the party is administered.
