There is tension in Enugu over the whereabouts of Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry, Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka. Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, on Wednesday, raised the alarm over his whereabouts, saying the cleric was missing. President-General of OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, alleged Mbaka was last seen on Tuesday, adding that every effort to trace him had failed. “We have it on good authority that his aides have neither seen nor heard from him since Tuesday. “Calls put to his mobile line have also remained unanswered; this has now prompted us to issue this alarm as we would not take it lightly should anything untoward happen to him. “We are giving the Federal Government 48 hours to produce the priest, else they should be ready to face Igbo youths. They were dining and wining with him all along and now that he told the truth, they are no longer comfortable with him. “Let nothing happen to Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka. It will not be in anybody’s interest,” the group warned. It sent out a signal to youths to gather at Adoration ground for a protest over the “missing Father”. The development led to a massive protest in the city of Enugu with members marching to the Bishop’s Court. The angry members of the Adoration Ministry vandalised the Bishop’s Court over allegation Mbaka was no longer seen after he honoured an invitation by the Bishop last night. The youths alleged Mbaka may have been arrested or abducted by gunmen. The cleric had called for the resignation or impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over rising insecurity. The presidency fired back he turned against Buhari, who he supported for election in 2015 and 2019. Details shortly…
