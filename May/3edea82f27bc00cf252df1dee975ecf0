Nigeria international  striker Samuel Chukwueze  would be buoyed with the presence of his  mentor  Santi  Cazorla when the Yellow Submarines file out against  Manchester United  in the 2001 Europa Cup final in Gdansk, Poland. The 22-year-old  who joined the  La Liga outfit  in the 2017/2018 season  following his stellar performance  at the  FIFA U-17 World Cup Chile 2015, has  huge respect for  his former teammate who is now plying his trade in Doha under Xavi for Al Sadd. Asked recently, who the most talented player he’s seen during his time with Villarreal, Chukwueze  noted matter-of-factly: “It has to be Santi Cazorla, he is a fantastic player who can play so well with both feet. He is special and very, very talented.” It would  therefore  be a delight for the Super Eagles star after the club’s  hierarchy  listed Cazorla along with   Bruno Soriano and Marcos Senna  in their travelling party to  watch the historic game against the English Premier league side. “Bruno Soriano and Santi Cazorla will join Marcos Senna and will cheer on Villarreal CF in Gdansk (Poland). The Yellows legends will accompany the Submarine in their historic UEFA Europa League final against Manchester United (Wednesday, 9pm CEST),” the club noted on its official website yesterday. Meanwhile,  Villarreal  left Spain last night for  Poland  in what will be their first UEFA Europa League final after being semi-finalists  in three previous occasions  in the 2003/04,2010/11 and  2015/16. The Unai Emery’s side trained behind closed doors yesterday  at their training ground and are expected to leave Castellón Airport this morning to Gdansk. In Poland,  coach Emery and two first-team players  will appear in the official pre-match press conference while the team would  have their  last training session tonight  at 7:45pm CEST at the Gdansk Stadium ahead of tomorrow’s final against Manchester United.
