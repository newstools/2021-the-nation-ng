THE House of Representatives on Thursday received the report on the allegation by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) that N1 trillion was wasted on constituency projects in 10 years. The motion of urgent national importance, sponsored by the Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, was referred to the House Committee on Ethics and Privileges in November 2019. The details of the Committee’s recommendations on the allegation are expected to be made public on a day to be determined by the House Committee on Rules and Business. Elumelu called on President Muhammadu Buhari and ICPC to initiate a probe into the utilisation of the estimated sum of over N70 trillion appropriated for the Federation through the Executive in the last 10 years. He maintained that members of the National Assembly are not contractors, nor members of the Tenders Board of various implementing MDAs. He was piqued that the agency that generated the information failed to state that the sum has not been released. “I am not happy because the information is capable of giving me a bad name before my community. The ICPC that wrote this report failed to tell the truth of how much was actually released. “When you say N1 trillion is budgeted like the President said, if that money was released completely, there will be value commensurate to the money. I wonder why the ICPC man failed to look at what was released. “Why should ours be a subject of debate that they will tell Nigerians we received N1 trillion when that was budgeted, but not released. My message is that we should let them know that while N1 trillion was budgeted for constituency projects, by way of releases, we did not receive that because what was released was less than 40 per cent,” Hon. Elumelu stressed.
