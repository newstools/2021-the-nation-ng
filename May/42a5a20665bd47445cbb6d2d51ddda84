Gunmen suspected to be terrorising waterways in Ese-Odo local government area have razed 15 houses in a midnight attack on Asere riverside community. The gunmen were said to have attacked the community for allegedly tipping off security agencies about their activities and movement. Following the attack, women in the community carried out a mass protest calling for the arrest of gang members. The protesting women said the attackers were known members of the community who got annoyed because the Joint Task Force cracked down on them. They identified the gang as Kutu Mone aka MK, July Mone, Best Oniwei, Iyemiyelawei Mone, Matthew Suku Polobubou, Dedewei Mone and Bado Ogbudugbudu. The protesters said the gang has been operating in the coastal area until security operatives started arresting them. One of the protesters who gave her name as Faith said the ringleader, Kutu Mone, who hails from Asere, invaded the community because he felt it was his people that tipped off security officials about their activities. Oba Zachueus Doubra, the Paramount Ruler of Agadagba Kingdom, said he received report that one of his subjects, who he described as a ‘recalcitrant boy’ invaded Asere to burn down the community.
