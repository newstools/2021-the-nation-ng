A real estate expert, Alhaji Lukman Ibrahim, has called on Nigerians to be united if the country wants to succeed in the war against insurgents. Alhaji Ibrahim, Chairman of Swift Partners Realty, an estate and property development company, spoke during the Ramadan Lecture of the Ogun State chapter of the Ansar-ud-Deen Islamic Society of Nigeria (ADSN) in Abeokuta. “We are facing a serious security challenge. Certainly, these challenges are surmountable if we all work collectively to surmount them.”  He hailed the Ansar-ud-Deen Islamic Society for pioneering the efforts of educating Muslim children without them losing their faith. “Ansar-ud-Deen was the brainchild of a group of young Muslims who came together to ensure a proper education for Muslims in Nigeria. Today, directly or indirectly, millions are products of the Ansar-ud-Deen educational system. What this society has achieved by putting aside their individual differences and working together to build a system that outlived them is remarkable,” he said. The Guest Speaker, Imam Tajudeen Adisa Taiwo, Missioner, ADSN Oke Odan branch, said human beings need to move closer to God in their quest to achieve greatness.
