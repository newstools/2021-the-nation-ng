Inter Milan veteran Ashley Young has provided details of exit from Manchester United, including an honest chat with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Romelu Lukaku ‘ringing me non-stop’. The 35-year-old joined Inter on a free transfer last summer and has gone on to play a major role in the Nerazurri’s Scudetto triumph.  Speaking to Sky Sports, Young said: “It became a massive decision. I was club captain and going into my 10th year, but the club was evolving and changing. Ole was there and he was doing really well. It was a decision I had to make in footballing terms. “I knew how fit I was and I knew I could play week in and week out. A lot is said about age, more so in England than in other countries. If you know how fit you are then there is no problem..”
