Music star Davido has just done a free collabo with Bello Barakat Omotola aka Twist Berry. Twist Berry is a known Vskit influencer, who has just benefitted from the immense benevolent nature of the DMW boss as he recently featured in her music video “The Code” for zero cost. The singer in a chat expressed her gratitude to Vskit, Infinix and finally Davido. Twist Berry revealed she is a major admirer of the “Fem” crooner but never in her wildest dream did she think of doing collaboration with him and at no cost. She said: “The studio session with Davido, the recording process and the fact that the music star is a down-to-earth person made me really happy. ‘’I won’t trade this experience for anything else. He literally lives up to his words “We rise by lifting others” among other things.’’ Twist Berry earlier this year released a reggae dance track she titled “Survive” produced by Babyboi.
