The Postmaster General (PMG) Nigeria Postal Services (NIPOST), Dr. Ismail Adewusi, has said the outfit is not at war with any agency of the government. Adewusi spoke yesterday in Abuja when he hosted the President of Silverbird Group, Mr. Guy Murray-Bruce, and the group’s management team at its national headquarters. Adewusi explained that rather than fight any government agency, NIPOST was working with them to move the government forward. He said: “Every government agency has its mandate. NIPOST has a mandate, which includes production of postage stamps, such as revenue stamps, which was covered by the Finance Act 2020.  “The postage stamps that NIPOST creates are not just to post letters but to also authenticate documents.” According to the PMG, NIPOST worked in partnership with the government and law enforcement agencies to ensure safety and legality of public documents. “We are not tax collectors but we provide instruments to validate the taxes collected,” he said. Murray-Bruce promised a refreshing and fulfilling partnership with NIPOST. He urged both parties to examine areas they could work on to market NIPOST’s products and services. The media chief also said it was important for Nigerians to have knowledge about postal code and its importance in data gathering of house addresses. He added that the group was hopeful that the partnership would promote peace and stability.
