There was uncertainty in the Niger Delta region on Tuesday morning over the whereabouts of President Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide, Peter Timothy Igbifa. While some sources claimed that Igbifa was kidnapped by masked gunmen, others said the IYC boss was not abducted. Igbifa’s disappearance occurred a few hours to the proposed shutdown of the region by Ijaw youths to protest failures of the Federal Government to inaugurate the substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The one-month ultimatum the youths gave Federal Government and Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, expired on Tuesday, raising fears the youngsters could make good their threat to shut down the region. Igbifa had given all oil multinationals seven days to evacuate their employees from oil platforms in the region ahead of the protest. It was, however, gathered Igbifa was on his way to the Port Harcourt International Airport to attend a meeting in Abuja when a black Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) blocked his car on Tuesday. A close associate of Igbifa said some armed masked men whisked him away to an unknown destination. But he said: “We can’t say he was kidnapped because we don’t know whether the men in black are kidnappers or officers of the Department of State Security (DSS) but currently Igbifa’s whereabouts are unknown”.
