The people of Umuode, Umuosu Nsulu in Isiala Ngwa North Local Government Area of Abia State have been left in shock as they were greeted Wednesday with the news that a popular palm wine tapper in the village has committed suicide. The late Palm Wine tapper in his mid-30, who was identified as Chinwendu Benson didn’t leave any note on why he decided to take his life, leaving the people to wonder what could have prompted a man they said that they saw in good health to take his own life. Sources around the area told our correspondent that the deceased who was popularly known as Igwe was found hanging on a tree in a bush in the village. The sources stated that it was early callers to the bush that saw a lifeless body that was hanging on a tree and raised alarm. The sources stated that some persons who summoned the courage to climb the tree on close observation identified the lifeless body to be the popular palm wine tapper. According to them, because it is a tradition not to bring down the corpse of anyone that died in such a manner, they at the time of filing the report were still waiting for the elders of the community to perform the needed ritual that would allow the corpse to be brought down. Efforts to reach the Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Geoffrey Ogbonna were unsuccessful as he couldn’t take calls put across to his line and was yet to reply to the text message sent to his mobile line.
