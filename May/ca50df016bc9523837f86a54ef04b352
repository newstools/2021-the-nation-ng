Jose Mourinho has said he desires to ‘create a winning project’ at Roma and chose the Gialloross for ‘the incredible passion of the fans’. The 58-year-old returns to Serie A ahead of 2021-22 with 25 major trophies in his luggage so far. The former FC Porto, Chelsea, Inter, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur coach has accepted a three-year contract and will succeed Paulo Fonseca after the season. “Thank you to the Friedkin family for choosing me to lead this great club and to be part of their vision,” Mourinho told the club’s official website. “After meetings with the ownership and Tiago Pinto, I immediately understood the full extent of their ambitions for AS Roma. “It is the same ambition and drive that has always motivated me and together we want to build a winning project over the upcoming years. “The incredible passion of the Roma fans convinced me to accept the job and I cannot wait to start next season. “In the meantime, I wish Paulo Fonseca all the best and I hope the media appreciate that I will only speak further in due course. Daje Roma!”
