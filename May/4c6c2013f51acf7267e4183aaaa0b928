BRUNO Fernandes is close to agreeing a new £200,000-a-week contract with Manchester United after admitting he is happy with the progress of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team. The Portuguese midfielder is set to double his current wages after another prolific season which has seen him top the Old Trafford scoring charts with 28 goals, the Mirror reports. His agent Miguel Pinto flew into Manchester on Tuesday to step up talks with United – and the club wants the deal to be sealed before the Euros. Fernandes said: “My priority today is to win trophies. Collective titles are more important than individual titles and we are working on that here. I think the club has improved a lot since I arrived here. “It is in a growth phase and the players are getting more and more the mentality that you should have in a club like Manchester United, which wants to win titles and more titles. Bruno, 26, moved from Sporting to United in a £47million deal just over a year ago and has become the Reds’ most consistent player.
