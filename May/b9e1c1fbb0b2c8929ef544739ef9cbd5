 Five persons have been arrested in Imo in connection with the attack on the reconstruction site of Orji Police Division. The suspects, Chigaemezu Sabastine, 26, Casmir Ibe, 36, John Chinonso, 24, Chukwudi Okoro, 28, and Alozie Daberechi, 25, were arrested yesterday afternoon in an operation led by Commissioner of Police Abuto Yaro. Spokesman Bala Elkana said the suspects attacked the site around 1pm to stop ongoing reconstruction of the facility. He said the station was destroyed during the EndSARS protest last October, adding that a philanthropist is footing the reconstruction bill. Elkana said: “The hoodlums, who believed that the re-establishment of a functional police station may prevent them from carrying out their nefarious acts in Orji and environs, decided to invade the construction site. “Before the arrival of reinforcement team, the hoodlums melted into the neighbouring townships area but abandoned their operational vehicles. “The Commissioner of Police, Imo State, CP Abutu Yaro, personally led an enforcement team to the scene. “The whole area was cordoned off and five suspects were arrested. No life was lost. Three vehicles were recovered,” Elkana said.
