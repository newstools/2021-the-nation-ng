A day after bragging on Facebook, a slay queen and her gang have been arrested by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The Makurdi zonal office on Saturday May 1, 2021 arrested four members of a syndicate of internet fraudsters in Makurdi, Benue State.  The suspects, Gideon Damisa, Sunday James, Friday Ebosele and Okiemute Deborah, were rounded up by operatives of the Commission following intelligence report on their alleged criminal activities in and around Makurdi metropolis. At the point of arrest, the principal suspect Gideon Damisa was in possession of a Mercedes Benz GLK 350 2010 Model, 1 iPhone, 2 Pro Max, 2 Infinix phone and ATM cards, among others. Dira, who had made a post on 1st May, posed by the side of a flashy car while calling on guys with royal blood to link up with her. She posted: “First day of the month looking absolutely stunning as usual, fake life at its peak but don’t borrow clothing to show off fully focused for the kingdom and the king’s spec only those with Royal blood should DM.” Hours after she made the post, the EFCC picked her up for alleged involvement in internet fraud.
