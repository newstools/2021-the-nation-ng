The General Manager (Strategy) of DPKay Homes & Property Ltd, Lagos, Mr. Olufemi Austine, has said decent accommodation for all Nigerians is feasible. He spoke at a news conference organised by the company in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos. Austine, flanked by the Director of Operations, Yomi Kuti, an engineer, and the Legal Director, Oluwaseun Alao, said the task of providing decent homes for Nigerians should not be left to the government alone. He said the private sector should also be involved in providing decent accommodation for Nigerians. “Our firm is expanding due to the way we treat our customers, especially in the area of money. Our properties are very cheap. “Our vision is to achieve the highest possible standards in the real estate market, while establishing ourselves as the premier and preferred real estate company in Nigeria,” Austine added.
