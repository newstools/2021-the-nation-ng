A lady has called out Nollywood actress Eniola Badmus for allegedly destroying her expensive phone at a club in Lagos. In a video making the rounds on social media, the lady alleged she had met the actress at a club and requested a selfie with her. The lady noted Eniola agreed to her request but after taking the photos, the actress got hold of her phone, deleted all the pictures from her Snapchat and smashed the phone on an iron. According to the lady, the actress smashed her phone even though she had earlier agreed to her request and ordered the bouncers to throw her out of the club. She said: “Hello guys, Good evening. I just feel right now is the right time to tell you guys what happened between me, Eniola and my phone…I was at DNA with my friends for my birthday party and I walked up to Eniola because I was at VIP and she was close to me. “So I said “Please can I take a picture of you?” and she agreed to…she agreed to. And after we took the pictures together, she took my phone and erased all the pictures from Snapchat not even my normal camera. She erased all of them and smashed my phone on that iron at DNA. She smashed the back of my phone that was what affected my phone.”
She recounted she had also snapped with a lot of stars on the said day. As she narrated her predicament further, she said the actress destroyed her phone which cost 350k in the process of smashing it on an iron. In the course of her narration, the lady also disclosed she is an actress and is currently using a small Nokia phone pending when she can get a better one. The later went on to plead with the actress saying; “Please, I need some money to get another phone even if it’s not all of it. You’re hurting me right now, God is seeing you.” Meanwhile, at the time of filing this report, the actress is yet to respond to the allegations.
