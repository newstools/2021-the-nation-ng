The Police in Ebonyi state have debunked reports that the man who was killed in an explosion on Tuesday in Afikpo, Ebonyi State is a suicide bomber. The Spokesperson of the Police in Ebonyi state, Loveth Odah said the victim of the blast is a Policeman on duty in the area. She said the policeman was a Mobile Police Officer on special deployment to Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. She said the officer, Mr Idi Aminu died as a result of an accidental hand grenade explosion. The incident which occurred opposite Amizi Amangbala Primary School in Afikpo North threw the area into panic as passersby scampered for safety. Residents believe he was a suicide bomber but Mrs. Odah said he was an Inspector of Police. “He mistakenly hit the lead of his grenade which was hanging on his waist with his elbow resulting in the deadly explosion,” she said. She noted that the police officer was an operative of MOPOL 32 and not a suicide bomber as being circulated in the social media. The spokesperson said his remains had been evacuated to a mortuary. Mrs. Odah cleared the air on alleged accidental discharge by a police officer at Government House Abakaliki. She pointed out that though a bullet accidentally fired from an AK-47 rifle when police officers posted to the gate were cleaning their firearms, it never hurt or killed any of them. Sources in the Afikpo had told Reporters that the incident happened around 12 noon when the man tried to gain access into a school.
