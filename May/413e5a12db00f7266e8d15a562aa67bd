 A 34-year-old man has been taken into police custody in Bayelsa for allegedly killing his friend and selling his body parts. Okpegboro Avwerosuo, from Ughelli North in Delta State killed his friend and roommate in Sagbama area of Bayelsa State and sold his vital organs to a pastor, a source said. Avwerosuo reportedly invited the deceased to his home in Sagbama on the pretext of starting a commercial motorcycle business, assuring him that it was flourishing in the town because of the presence of Isaac Jasper Adaka Boro College of Education in the area. But barely two weeks after the deceased arrived, Avwerosuo allegedly hit him in the head with a pestle in the middle of the night, killing him. Avwerosuo then dismembered his body, preserved the vital organs and put the other parts in separate sacks which he disposed of in the early hours of the next day.  The source said while the suspect was disposing the sacks, another neighbour who saw him and suspected his movements confronted him later in the afternoon about the whereabouts of his roommate. The source said: “The suspect claimed that the deceased had travelled back to Delta State for an urgent business transaction. “Not satisfied with his response, the neighbour forced his way into the suspect’s room and saw blood stains all over. The neighbour held him down and alerted the local vigilantes who eventually called the police to arrest the suspect. “Upon interrogation, the suspect confessed that he had sold the vital organs of the deceased to a pastor in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, for ritual purposes.” Police spokesman Asinim Butswat confirmed that the suspects was in custody.
