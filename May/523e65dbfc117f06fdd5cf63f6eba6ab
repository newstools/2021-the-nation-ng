This week’s edition of African Voices Changemakers, sponsored by National Telecommunication Company, Globacom will feature two bourgeoning Africans who have distinguished themselves in graphics and fashion world. In a press statement in Lagos on Friday, Globacom said the programme would host Mariama Camara, founder of a leading African handmade sustainable textiles company, who is resident in the United States of America and Justice Mukheli, a South Africa- based artist, filmmaker, and fine art photographer. Mariama Camara is the Founder and Creative Designer of MARIAMA CAMARA, a New York City based sustainable fashion brand and also founder of Mariama Fashion Production, the leading African handmade sustainable textiles and accessories company.  Her passion for textiles and handmade products grew while watching her family design prints as a girl. Mariama’s great grand-mother was among the most successful female tie dyers in the region of Guinea. Mariama became the first Guinean to showcase the efforts of female tie-dyers from her roots to the international market, through her non-profit organization There Is No Limit Foundation. Justice Mukheli on the other hand is a Johannesburg, South Africa- based self-taught photographer and film maker widely known for creating “intellectually and emotionally dense work.” His works project Africans positively and correct wrong narratives about the continent across the world.
