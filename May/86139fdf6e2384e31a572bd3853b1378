Senator Dino Melaye’s tweet urging people to always seek to improve themselves educationally has stirred the hornet’s nest on Twitter with some of his followers lashing out at both the Kogi-born politician as well as the political class. Of recent, Melaye has posted more motivational tweets than political messages on his social media handles, leading many to dub him a ‘coach.’ So, last Tuesday, when the former Kogi West senator tweeted that “It is better to have a degree that you don’t need than need a degree you don’t have. Please go to school as no time is too late,” it came as one of his now common motivations for those following him. While readers promptly responded appreciatively to his charge, the party soon turned rowdy as more and more respondents started taking on him and the political class over what they described as the bastardization of education and academic certificates in the country. One wrote: “And after graduation, one gets educated with no job. What’s the need for the degree? You people should better create jobs for those that went to school if you support education.” Another simply said: “I hear you. What about those of us who cannot afford to pay school fees? Arinze Chukwuneta with @ArinzeChukwune4 posted: “Going to school isn’t the problem sir. A lot of youths out there are unemployed, and you people are still advising us to go and spend more money.” From Dr. Tijani Lukman Adebisi, it was a blow below the belt for the former senator. Going sarcastic, he tweeted: “Even if it will take many years to pass a geography course, just try to get a certificate and not so bad to get at the eve of Senate waivers – let my people go!”
