The President Nigerian Air Force Officers’ Wives Association (NAFOWA), Mrs. Elisabeth Amao, has urged members to always pray for their husbands and the country especially during this period of insecurity. She made the plea on Tuesday during her maiden working visit to NAFOWA, Logistics Command (LC) chapter in Lagos where she solicited their support to move the association forward. Noting the association was created for the women to stick together, she reminded the women it was not a platform for intimidation or gossip. “I want you to remember that NAFOWA is not an avenue for gossip, not a place to show power. There are a lot of things to benefit in NAFOWA. NAFOWA is a platform for you to stick together. This can be done by cooperating with your Chairperson and Commander’s wife. “Ladies, you should serve as an example to people around you. The senior officer’s wife should serve as an example to the younger ones. Mostly, we should learn to be prayerful. We should remember our husbands, family in prayers and also our country, Nigeria especially in this time of insecurity,” she said. Assuring them their requests for the provision of a bus and other infrastructure have been noted, Mrs. Amao also admonished the women to ensure they respect the by-laws governing the group as well as avoid accessorising their uniform. Chairperson, NAFOWA LC chapter, Mrs. Oluwayemisi Makinde, appealed for assistance to complete some pending projects in the chapter including a school in Victoria Island, relocation to the permanent site of the NAFOWA Little Angels School, Ishaga, among others.
