Villarreal beat Manchester United beat 11-10 on penalties to win the Europa League final in front of 9,500 fans in Gdansk, Poland. The Red Devils were aiming for their first trophy under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and last won competition under Jose Mourinho in 2017. Villarreal took a shock lead in the 29th  minute when Gerard Moreno, netting his 30th  goal in all competitions this season, took advantage of sloppy defending by United’s center-backs Lindolf and Eric Bailly to direct in a cross from a freekick. Edison Cavani drew United level in the 55th minute when Villarreal only half-clear Luke Shaw’s corner to Marcus Rashford. He hammers a first-time shot in which takes about three ricochets and lands to the feet of Edinson Cavani. United had a chance to bury the game in regulation time when Bruno Fernandes beat the offside trap on the right and squared it to Marcus Rashford, who completely scuffed a shot which rolled wide at just eight yards out.
