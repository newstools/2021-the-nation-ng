Tyson Fury has ‘quit alcohol’ in preparation for his heavyweight clash with Anthony Joshua – weeks after confessing he was sinking up to “12 pints a day”. The Gypsy King is set to take on his British rival for a unification bout in August, looking to defend his WBC belt won against Deontay Wilder. AJ’s opponent, though, suggested that his preparations were not as intense by saying he had stopped in recent months to take on heavy drinking. But a source close to Fury has revealed a turnaround in the 32-year-old’s preparations for the fight that is now three months away. Speaking to The Sun, an insider said: “Tyson has kicked the booze on the head for good. “It is not because of the boxing, because he can always get in shape for fights and obviously doesn’t drink during training camps. Tyson is doing this for himself and his family — especially his wife Paris. “And he reckons it is the best way to be a great dad and stay in shape physically and mentally.” Meanwhile Fury said his world heavyweight title showdown with Joshua will take place in Saudi Arabia on 14 August. The all-British bout has been billed as one of the biggest in heavyweight boxing for decades and the winner will become undisputed champion. Joshua, 31, holds the WBA, WBO and IBF belts, while Fury, 32, is WBC champion. In announcing the fight date in a video on Twitter, Fury said: “All eyes of the world will be on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and I cannot wait to smash Anthony Joshua on the biggest stage of all times. “This is going to be the biggest sporting event ever to grace the planet earth. Do not miss it.”
