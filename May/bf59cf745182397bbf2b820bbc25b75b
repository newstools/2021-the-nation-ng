Andre Gray admits the Watford bench thought Isaac Success was looking ‘knackered’ before he scored a superb goal in the 2-0 win over Swansea City. The Hornets ended their Championship season on a high with Gray also on the score sheet, taking the team’s total to 91 points for the campaign. Speaking to Hive Live after the match, the striker, who had been substituted earlier in the match, said he and the rest of Success’s teammates thought the Nigerian was looking a little fatigued before he added gloss to the win with a thunderous strike into the top corner. “We were saying on the bench how knackered he was,” joked Gray. “He hasn’t played much this season and then you’ve seen after he scored the energy that he’s come into! It’s quite normal when you score, you get a bit of an adrenaline rush, but it’s an absolutely great finish.” Also, Coach Xisco Munoz felt Isaac Success’s wonder goal was reward for the effort he has put in since returning from injury. “Everybody knows about the quality of Isaac,” said Munoz. “I think Isaac is a very good player. He had bad luck because he was out for one year with an injury. After he came back, it’s important that everyone understands the process when a player is out for a long time without playing.
