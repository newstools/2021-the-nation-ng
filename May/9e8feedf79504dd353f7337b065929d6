Gunmen have attacked the Abia Command of Nigeria Immigration Service(NIS) located at Ubakala axis of Enugu-Aba-Port Harcourt Expressway in Umuahia South local government area on the outskirts of the state capital. While the amount of damage to the facility was yet to be verified, The Nation gathered no life was lost during the attack. The attack, our correspondent gathered, occurred on Saturday evening. It came few hours after gunmen attacked Abia Police Commandâ€™s Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) at Ugwunchara along Umuahia-Uzuakoli-Ohafia Expressway. The situation was said to have heightened fears among Ubakala indigenes and residents yet to recover from the attack on Divisional headquarters of Nigeria Police in Apunmiri community. The incident was said to have forced many residents and indigenes to quickly close as economic activities were grounded at the busy Ubakala junction and the daily Apunmiri market. Also, the corpse of a yet-to-be identified commercial tricycle operator has been reportedly found discovered. Eyewitnesses alleged the deceased was shot by policemen in a convoy suspected to be heading towards the attacked State CID facility. Contacted, Abia State Police spokesman, Geoffrey Ogbonna, was yet to respond to enquiries on the incidents.
