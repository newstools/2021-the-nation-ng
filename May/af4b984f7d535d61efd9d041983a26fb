Miss Treasure Ofuya, the 13-year-old girl, who has been missing for six days, has been found. Delta Police spokesman DSP Bright Edafe, who confirmed the incident, said she is with security agents in Oghara, Ethiope West LGA, Delta State. Edafe said: “Missing Treasure Ofuya has been found in Oghara, she is currently with the police and will be reunited with her family soon.” The police had declared the teen missing on May 5, days after she failed to return home from school. The Nation gathered the victim left on April 30, 2021 around 1400hrs for New Era Model School Jakpa Road Effurun but did not return home. It was learnt her disappearance may not be unconnected with an argument that ensued between her and her mother, Mrs. Faith Ofuya, over misuse of phone and possession of a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).
