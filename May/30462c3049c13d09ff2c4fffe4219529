Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers has credited Nigeria international duo, Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho, for the Foxes brilliant season. The Foxes will secure a return to the Champions League with victory tonight against Chelsea, the team they beat to win their first FA Cup on Saturday. At the beginning of the season, with reliable center back Jonny Evans out with injury and newly recruited Frenchman Wesley Fofana not yet in the club, the Northern Irishman had to appeal to Wilfred Ndidi to play a defensive role at newly promoted West Brom on match day one. The Foxes were able to win the game 3-0 and then the next one 4-2 at the King Power Stadium. “First game of the season, going to West Brom knowing that it was going to be a tough game against a newly-promoted team. That was a challenge for us,” Rodgers said. Wilf (Ndidi) played there at home to Burnley too and was exceptional.” “The start of the season involved putting players in positions that maybe they don’t play so much but he was someone I have always had immense trust in. He has all the attributes. “Making that good start was important for us.” On Iheanacho, the former Liverpool boss praised the  productive partnership between the 24 year-old and Jamie Vardy, adding that suggestions that he had little choice but to turn to Iheanacho was misguided. “Picking him (Iheanacho) was one thing. Finding a way to help him to score 12 goals in nine games was another.” “Again, that was a case of looking at the assets that were not available,” Rodgers stated. “We had to get goal scorers in the team and have that creativity because there is no point playing a similar system if you do not have the players to play it the way you want. You can say that it was forced on us,” he added. “But we could very easily have continued playing the same system and it would not have worked.”
