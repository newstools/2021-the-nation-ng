Moyo Lawal has warned fans and social media buffs not to judge people by their social media posts. The curvy actress noted that social media posts do not define a person saying people do a lot of horrible things behind closed doors but disguise themselves on social media. “If by now, you still haven’t learned that a person’s image has almost nothing to do with their true personality, I don’t know what to tell you. A lot of people forget social media is just a digital tool that allows users to share (controlled) content with the public. “Too many horrible things going on behind closed doors but because we live in an image-conscious society, we all will continue to suffer and it is not stopping anytime soon, no matter the outrage. This our society, so far you don’t do it outside you are fine,” she said. The actress also advised that parents should endeavour to teach children and youngsters about true value and integrity without being watched.
