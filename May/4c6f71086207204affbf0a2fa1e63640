The much-anticipated 2022 African Women’s Nations Cup eliminator between the Super Falcons and perennial rivals Black Queens of Ghana has been moved from June to October. CAF had originally fixed this eliminator for between June 7-15, but the match will now be played between October 18 and 26 after the continental governing body cited Coronavirus travel restrictions for this decision. This first round match-up means one of these two powerhouses in women’s football in Africa will not feature at the 2022 AWON in Morocco, which will also serve as a qualifier for the 2023 World Cup in New Zealand. The change in dates means the Falcons will now feature in several invitational tournaments before this crucial qualifier. The invitational tournament includes one to be hosted by world champions USA.
