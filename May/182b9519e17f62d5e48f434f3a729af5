 Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has imposed a 24-hour curfew on Ikare Akoko in Akoko North East local government area over violence that rocked the community since Monday over the Olokoja chieftaincy title. Akeredolu also barred Chief Ogunye Idowu and Chief Sunday Bada to stop parading themselves as Olokoja of Okoja. Four persons have been reportedly killed and others injured in the violence. A statement by Ondo Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, said the curfew takes effect from 6.00pm on May 5, 2021. The statement reads: “Government warns that Security Agencies have been deployed and mandated to enforce the curfew. Accordingly, anyone who violates or contravenes this order shall face the full wrath of the Law. Dire consequences await such defaulters “In the meantime, Government has ordered the immediate suspension of all activities relating to the OLOKOJA chieftaincy title. In this regard, no one is permitted to parade himself as OLOKOJA, or engage in promotional activities relating to the title in question. This directive takes immediate effect.”
