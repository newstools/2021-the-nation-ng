The former youth international just completed a loan spell in Germany, but he could be on the move again. Belgian giants Anderlecht have had a 2.5 billion naira (5 million Euros) bid for Nigerian striker Taiwo Awoniyi rejected by Liverpool. Awoniyi has never hidden his desire to play for the Reds but has not made a single appearance for the Anfield side since joining them six years ago. The thorny issue of his work permit has, however, been finally resolved, and the former Golden Eaglets star is eligible to feature for Liverpool in the English Premier League. Awoniyi recently completed a loan spell with Union Berlin. He impressively notched five goals and four assists in 21 games despite injury limiting his appearances and productivity towards the end of the Bundesliga campaign. The German club announced they would not be making the 24-year-old’s stay permanent as he returned to England. But it appears Liverpool have no intention of retaining his services for much longer as the dethroned league champions are willing to listen to offers for the former youth international. But  the Anfield giants according to Voetbal, want more than the five million euros offered by Anderlecht. They would likely be ready to let the Super Eagles hopeful depart permanently for twice that amount. Awoniyi has been excellent during several loan spells in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany and should not be short of suitors when the summer transfer window kicks into full gear.
