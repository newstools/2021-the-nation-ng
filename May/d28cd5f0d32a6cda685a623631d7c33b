A governorship aspirant in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the November 6 election in Anambra State, Lady Chidi Onyemelukwe, said on Monday that she has what it takes to transform the state if given the opportunity. Onyemelukwe, the daughter of Nigeriaâ€™s first vice president, the late Dr. Alex Ekwueme, said her stay at the State House during the four-year tenure of her father exposed her to the rudiments of leadership. Speaking with reporters in Awka, the governorship aspirant said leadership was not a tea party, stressing that those aspiring to be the governor should be ready to work and pay the supreme price if there is need.
