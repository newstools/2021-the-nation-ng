The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has debunked messages that it is demanding money from job seekers. Director, Media and Advocacy, NDLEA Headquarters, Abuja, Femi Babafemi, said this in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday. The Agency advised candidates scheduled for screening as narcotic officers and narcotic assistants in Abuja and Jos from next week and other job seekers not to fall for scammers sending them messages to demand payment. The statement reads, “Our attention has been drawn to some messages being sent round to some shortlisted candidates and other job seekers to make payment into some phony bank accounts to secure them employment slot. “Of particular interest is a message that reads: ‘You are to come with a medical certificate of fitness, guarantor form, credentials, registration slip and writing materials to NDLEA. “Shortlisted candidates, other job seekers and the general public should please note that the NDLEA will not ask for payment from anyone seeking to work in the Agency and are therefore urged to discountenance this fraudulent message and similar ones.” According to the statement, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. General Mohamed Buba Marwa (Rtd) has directed the Agency’s directorate of intelligence to track and apprehend the fraudsters behind the scam messages.
