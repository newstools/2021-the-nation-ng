Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has said he was highly delighted with the 2-1 victory over Manchester City, adding that they almost lost the Premier League match in the first half on Saturday. “What a performance in the second half. It was more or less equal in the first half but we almost gave the game away in the last five minutes. If they scored the penalty, maybe the game would have been over before it really started. “If it went to 2-0, maybe we wouldn’t have had a chance to come back. It was very hard, we were 1-0 down and had an injured player, I’m absolutely impressed by the performance and reaction in the second half and we deserved to win the second half. “If you want to steal all three points at the Etihad in this situation, of course you need a bit of luck, momentum, and decisions from the referee. But we had many chances in the second half, so a big, big congratulations to the players.”
