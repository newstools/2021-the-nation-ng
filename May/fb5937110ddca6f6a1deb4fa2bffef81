Thomas Tuchel has named his full 25-man Chelsea squad for tomorrow’s Champions League Final against Manchester City. Tuchel and his players flew out from Gatwick Airport to Porto yesterday ahead of this weekend’s huge all-English final in Portugal. Edouard Mendy and N’Golo Kante had been injury doubts for the Blues, but both returned to training on Wednesday – and Tuchel has allayed fears over the key duo. “N’Golo is looking good and I hope he stays like that for Saturday,” Tuchel said. “Edou made a huge improvement with the management of pain from when the injury happened, which is good. We hope to have him back. If he is fit, then Edou will play.”
