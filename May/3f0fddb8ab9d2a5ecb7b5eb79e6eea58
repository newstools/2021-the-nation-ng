A 48-year old man, Thomas Igbo has been paraded by the Anambra State Command of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) for allegedly defiling his three biological daughters. The suspect, from Ikolo, Igbo-Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu State but resident in Enugwu-Ukwu, Njikoka Local Government Area with his wife and four kids, was said to have sexually abused his three female children aged 8, 4 and 18 months respectively. The suspect however confessed abusing his eldest daughter but denied molesting the remaining two, blaming his action on alcohol influence. The Nation however gathered that the 4-year old daughter confessed the molestation of the father to a human rights group, Child Protection Network who facilitated the arrest. Similarly, a report from the Ntasi Centres for Sexual Assault Cases, General Hospital Enugwu-Ukwu confirmed that the three children were severally molested. The State Commandant, NSCDC, Mr. David Billie said investigation had since commenced, adding that the suspect would be charged as soon as the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria, JUSUN, currently on strike resumed work. He described the action as painful, advising parents to be more responsible in taking care of their children. Narrating how the ordeal was discovered to newsmen, Spokesperson for Child Protection Network, Mrs. Okwuchukwu Chukwuenyem, said the case was brought to their notice after a neighbor noticed the despicable behavior of the man. Chukwuenyem who doubles as Director of SafeNest, said, “The man’s daily chore was to take the children separately on daily basis, mostly between 9pm and 10:30pm but what made the neighbor raise eyebrows was the day he asked them in Pidgin English, “e sweet” to the neighbor’s hearing.”
