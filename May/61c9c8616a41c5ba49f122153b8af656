THE experiences of life of Stella Olusanmi who is founder, Stella Ihwechi Foundation can suitably fit into a Nollywood movie bestseller. Born into a disunited family of constant squabbles and abuse, as a result, Olusanmi over the years became immune to abuse and became a ‘patience’ expert of 27 years of her life – bringing her experiences to bear in a book she entitled, ‘Overcoming Manipulation.’ The main message is to know how to overcome manipulation without cutting off the bond of friendship and family unity but set boundaries that do not allow you to be maltreated. Olusanmi who is a conflict mediator and On-Air-Personality said: “The idea is to educate some of us how manipulation can turn an individual into a dumb and daft person in a situation. What manipulation is and the different ways one can be manipulated. A lot of persons are manipulated in their marriages, by siblings, at work places etc. At work, people manipulate each other to take over their positions or to be favoured by their superiors.” Sold at the cost of N3000, per copy, the book according to Olusanmi would be freely given to students in secondary schools because of her spiritual conviction and her experience of dropping out of school due to lack of financial assistance. “We want to bridge this gap. The proceeds gotten through this book will be used to send over 1,000 children back to different schools all over the country. Nigeria is great and a land of opportunities. Let us help a few that we can, get equipped in taking the opportunity that is available.  We will through a foundation pay and enrol them in different schools.” She however pleaded for partnership and assistance from well spirited Nigerians to do more.
