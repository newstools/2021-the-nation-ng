Stakeholders in Benue State, on Thursday, at a meeting in Makurdi, passed a vote of confidence in Governor Samuel Ortom for his efforts to ensure the security of life and property. Chieftains across party lines, monarchs, the clergy, federal and state lawmakers as well as others said Ortom had demonstrated true leadership.  The motion for the confidence vote was moved by leaders of the three main socio-cultural organisations in the state; Mzough-U-Tiv, Ochetoha,  K’Idoma and Omini ‘Igede. “We are fully satisfied with the performance of the governor, particularly his firm stand for the protection of our people.  His efforts in the area of security are responsible for the relative peace being enjoyed in parts of the state today. We remember that in 2018, Fulani herdsmen attacks engulfed 19  of the 23 local government areas. Today, the herders have resorted to guerrilla tactics of attacking our people in their sleep,” the leaders said. Other resolutions at the meeting were that following renewed attacks by herdsmen, the government should enforce Community Volunteer Guards (Vigilante) Law, enacted in 2000. The stakeholders mandated the government to recruit more personnel and support them with logistics as provided by the law to contain these attacks. According to the governor, stakeholders resolved that volunteer guards be recruited across all districts and councils and be empowered to carry arms for protection. The meeting also reinforced the commitment of Benue people to the enforcement of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, 2017. Stakeholders praised security agencies for their efforts in ensuring relative peace and security in parts of the state.
