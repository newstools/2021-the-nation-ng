 The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dissolved the Cross River State Caretaker Committee of the party. The dissolution came 24 hours after the defection of the Cross River State governor, Prof Ben Ayade from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC). A statement issued by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday said the decision to dissolve the committee was in pursuant to the powers conferred on the NWC by the PDP Constitution.  “Consequently, the NWC has constituted a new State Caretaker Committee to pilot the affairs of the chapter of the party at the state level,” the statement said. Members of the new caretaker committee as stated by the party are Efiok Cobham (Chairman), Attah Ochinke; Dr. Uke Enun, Prof. Walter Mboto, Rita Ayim (Publicity Secretary) and Mike Usibe. Others are Christopher Ekpo, Mr. Victor Effiom Okon, Prince K.J. Agba and Eko Atu (Secretary). The statement however said all structures of the party at the local government and ward levels in the state remain intact.
