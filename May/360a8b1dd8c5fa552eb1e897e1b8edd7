Two of the Premier League’s top four sides meet today as the season nears its climax and Nigeria international Wilfred Ndidi said the Foxes’ targets won’t change, irrespective of venue or opposition, especially at such a pivotal moment in the campaign. Looking ahead to tackling Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s Red Devils, the 24-year-old told LCFC TV: “It’s one of those games. We have to try and do our best to get something out of it. We’ve got three games left, so it’s that part of the season where every point is really important. “It’s a tough game. Obviously, the last time we met, we knocked them out of the FA Cup, but it’s going to be a difficult game. We’ll look forward to it and see what comes out of it. They’re a really good team, a really strong side. The players they have are top quality. “They’ve really done well in the league and the Europa League. They will also want to finish as high as possible, which is how every team wants to finish the season. It’s something that means we have to go there, see what comes out of it, and we’ll give everything.” City have won 10 and lost just two of their away Premier League fixtures this season, but Ndidi says that success comes down to always taking the opposition seriously, regardless of where they are in the league table. “In the Premier League, it doesn’t matter if you’re playing Manchester United or another team, you’re just going for the points,” he added, speaking at LCFC Training Ground in Seagrave. “We’ve been on a fantastic run away from home. “We’ve had some ups and downs and some games where we should have got more points, but we’re looking forward to this one and we’ll be trying as much as we can to get points. We’re in the last part of the season so every point is very important for us.”
