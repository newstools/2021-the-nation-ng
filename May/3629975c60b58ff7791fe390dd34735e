“I swear I just wanna love one girl and move on,” were the words of 21-year-old singer Divine ‘Rema’ Ikubor as he turned 21. The Jonzin/Mavins act confessed while expressing his thoughts on women and long-life partnership. Rema went further to say he doesn’t intend to sleep around with too many girls despite being young because such a move will not only violate his energy but breed disrespect all in the name of sex. The rave singer also noted that he would neither be needing cult or professional securities for protection because God has been sufficient for him in the past years. “I am where I am today because of God, his grace, and his favour covers me, therefore I shall lick no ass. I don’t need cult or security for protection who wan fight me to make he come Angel Micheal dey my gate!” Rema, who is yet to feature any music act on his song – but has been featured by several music stars – won the Headies Next Rated Award in 2019. “How will an OG win awards one year and because he didn’t win the awards the next year they say he’s falling off? Why? For not doing what he already did? That’s stupid. Niggas listen to that shit and kill themselves in the studio trying to prove what they already proved! Wake up! “His lyrics are childish” Yes! I’m young fucking let me grow, if I start spitting all the bars now what will spit when I’m 30 years old, I barely write music let me have a collection of experiences and chat real shit from my heart! Many niggas sing about shit they don’t do!” The ‘Iron Man’ star went further to advise fans and youngsters saying ‘too many youths get depressed and commit suicide because they want to be rich and famous early.’ He urged youths to ignore peer or societal pressure and remain patient.
