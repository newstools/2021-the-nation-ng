GUNMEN on Sunday attacked B Division of the Nigeria Police Divisional Station and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Akwa, Anambra. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) gathered that the armed attackers came in three Hilux trucks around 8pm. An eyewitness, who almost ran into the troubled area located in between the popular Ekwueme Square, Awka, said the bandits shot into the air close at B Police Division before proceeding to INEC office. The source, who spoke in anonymity, said before proceeding to INEC, the gunmen drove to Aroma Junction and shot in the air for about 10 minutes which made residents to run for cover before they proceeded to the INEC office. Though the source said he could not speak on causality figure, it added that there was likelihood of collosal damage at both institutions with possible killings of human beings. “I saw flames of fire going up from the police station and INEC offices but I cannot say whether people were killed or not because I did not go closer,” he said. When contacted, Dr Nkwachukwu Orji, INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Anambra said he had received information on the attack in his office, but that he could not officially comment on the matter. “I need to get clear picture of what happened in my office before I can speak”, he said. In the same vein, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Tochukwu Ikenga, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said he was still making contacts to get details of the situation.
