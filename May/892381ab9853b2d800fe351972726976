The Niger Delta Progressive Alliance (NDPA) has faulted a claim by the Concerned Senior Staff Members of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) that Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi and his wife Judith were involved in the mismanagement of NDDC funds. The “staff members” had urged the Presidency to investigate the couple’s involvement. NDPA, in a statement by its spokesperson Ikporukpo David, urged the Presidency and the public to discountenance the allegations. “This is nothing but another cheap and unholy attempt to mar the good image of Mr Amaechi, his wife and other individuals mentioned in the press release by the Concerned Senior Staff Members of NDDC. “As a progressive group which is committed to transparency and accountability, we hereby stand against any attempt to manipulate facts for purely selfish reasons,” David said. According to NDPA, the allegations lacked merit and came from “a faceless group”.
