The Akwa Ibom state government says it is aligning with the decision of the Southern governors on opening grazing and would enact a law to that effect. Commissioner for information and Strategy, Comrade Iniobong Emembong said the state is against open grazing. According to him if not for the nationwide strike by parliamentary workers, the State House of Assembly would have come up with a law banning opening grazing in all parts of the state. ”The Attorney General of the state has intimated that no law has been enacted to that effect yet, but we are certainly bound by the decision of the southern governors meeting. ”And you know that legislative business has been stalled for a while due to the strike by Parliamentary staff. ”Maybe legislative actions could have commenced if the assembly was sitting,” he said.
