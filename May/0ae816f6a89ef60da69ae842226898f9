Almost 60 percent of people in Japan believe the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games should be cancelled, according to a study released on Sunday, as coronavirus infections surge across the country and anti-Olympics protests continue. A total of 59.7 percent stated that they were opposed in a two-day Kyodo News telephone survey, which also found more than a quarter, 25.2 percent, felt the Games should happen without fans, with 12.6 percent wanting them to go ahead but with limited fan numbers. The results demonstrate rising opposition to holding the sporting event, put on hold from its planned start in summer 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic, in the current context of a fourth wave of infections including more contagious variants. Despite Olympic organisers already ruling out any overseas fans to avoid spreading Covid-19, 87.7 percent of those studied expressed concern that the mass arrival of athletes and staff could spread the virus. A survey in April showed 39.2 percent wanted the event to be cancelled, with 32.8 percent keen for it to be rescheduled and just 24.5 percent happy for it to continue as planned. Coronavirus cases are on the rise across the country in the last month, with a slow vaccine rate, a lack of hospital beds and the new variants exacerbating the situation – a trend which 90.3 per cent of responses raised concerns about. Over half of those studied – 53.9 per cent – said athletes should be prioritised for vaccinations, with 13.1 per cent saying otherwise and around a third, 32.7 per cent, unable to give a clear reply. The Kyodo News study covered 715 randomly selected households of eligible voters and 1,254 mobile numbers, receiving 542 and 523 responses respectively. Olympic Games in the Japanese capital are set to begin on July 23, with the Paralympics currently planned to start on August 24.
