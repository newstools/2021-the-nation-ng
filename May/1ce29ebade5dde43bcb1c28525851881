Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) Plc will tomorrow launch a campaign to project its new positioning and commitment to the African financial markets as a leading capital market infrastructure provider, connecting Nigeria, Africa and the world. Themed, The Stock Africa Is Made Of, the campaign will kick off with a webinar and will amplify NGX Group’s new brand identity and spotlight the growth potential of the African continent across traditional and digital media. ‘The Stock Africa Is Made Of’ campaign comes on the back of the successful demutualisation of the Nigerian Stock Exchange which led to the emergence of NGX Group Plc and its three subsidiaries – Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited, NGX Regulation (NGX RegCo) Limited and NGX Real Estate (NGX RelCo) Limited. Group Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group Plc, Mr. Oscar Onyema, said NGX remains committed to the highest level of competitiveness, both in the African and global capital markets. He said the campaign had been designed to reinforce the message that the Exchange is  equipped and better positioned to champion the development of new and improved experiences for the benefit of domestic, regional and foreign stakeholders. “We are excited to show the world that we embody the same traits of ambition, strength, innovation and excellence that distinguish the African continent, and we are confident that these qualities will see us thrive in an era of endless possibilities,” Onyema added.  According to him, built around the new corporate identity, the campaign emphasises the vibrancy and dynamism of NGX Group and its subsidiaries while providing stakeholders with an immersive experience through creative messaging and opportunities for direct engagement with the brand.  “Our goal is not only to celebrate this pivotal point in our journey, but to also show our stakeholders that we are ready and able to explore new frontiers in our quest to be the partner and platform of choice for meeting their business, financial and investment objectives,” Onyema said.
