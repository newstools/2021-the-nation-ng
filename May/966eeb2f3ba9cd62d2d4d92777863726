Music star Olamide Gbenga Adedeji aka Olamide or Olamide Baddo has dropped a banging new record titled “Rock” for the fans. “Rock” is taken from his yet-to-be-released album titled “Uy Scuti,” which drops exactly one month from the release of this new single. The ten-track LP, Baddo Sneh’s third new music project in just over a year, is set for release on June 14 through a partnership between his YBNL Nation imprint and US indie powerhouse, EMPIRE. This comes barely a year after Olamide dropped his critically acclaimed “Carpe Diem,” which he released in October. The video for “Rock” was directed by renowned Nigerian director Clarence Peters, takes viewers inside a noir vision of Lagos, starring Olamide and dancer Soliat Bada, as flirtatious lovers plotting a rendezvous. Rising Nigerian beatmaker Eskeez, who handles the lion’s share of production on “UY Scuti”, produced the intimate, mid-tempo Afrobeats banger. At the moment there isn’t much word about the incoming body of work.
