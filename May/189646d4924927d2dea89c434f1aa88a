Champions League finalists Chelsea and Manchester City have emerged as contenders to sign Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski this summer, sources told ESPN, with the striker undecided on his future. Lewandowski, 32, has a contract at Bayern until 2023 and sources told ESPN that interested clubs would need to offer €60 million to start negotiations over a possible move.  One of the all-time Bundesliga greats, Lewandowski has 36 league goals in 31 matches this season and is closing in on Gerd Muller’s record of 40 in a season, set in the 1971-72 campaign. The Poland international is also on 272 Bundesliga goals across his career in Germany, for Borussia Dortmund and Bayern, and would have Muller’s record of 365 on his radar if he did stay.
