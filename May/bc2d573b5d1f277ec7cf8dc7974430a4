The Chief Imam of Ibadan, Sheikh AbdulGaniyu Abubakry Agbotomokekere on Wednesday performed Eid prayer at the Ibadan Central Eid praying ground, Agodi. Deputy Governor Rauf Olaniyan and Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji were some of the dignitaries at the prayer ground. The prayer held despite the directive from the National Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) that fasting should continue as a result of the non-sighting of the Shawal moon by authorities last night. The directive makes the Ramadan month to extend to 30. A Facebook post on Agbotomokekere page on Tuesday morning had announced Ramadan ended on Tuesday and he was go to lead the Eid prayer Wednesday morning. True to his promise, Agbotomokekere led some Muslims to Eid but with many notable religious leaders like the Aare Musulumi of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta States, Alhaji Dawud Makanjuola Akinola De-Damak and former Governor Rashidi Ladoja among others missing. It was also observed the Eid prayer ground was well attended but lower compared with the usual busy activities at the ground. The reason, it was gathered, was because some faithful are still observing the fast.
