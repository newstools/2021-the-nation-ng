Tokyo Olympics-bound Elizabeth Anyanacho is now ranked 62nd d in the world, according to the latest ‘world ranking’ for May 2021 as published by World Taekwondo (WT). Anyanacho who only started competing in 2017 became the first woman in 16 years to qualify Nigeria for the Taekwondo event of the Olympics. At the start of 2019, Anyanacho had no world ranking but by May 2019, she was ranked 163rd  in the world and  was  ranked 85th  by December 2019. World ranking records in June 2020 showed that she climbed up to the 71st  position before the global lockdown on sporting activities due to the COVID-19. The resumption of the international competitive schedule in 2021 has seen Anyanacho grabbing vital points at the Turkish Open, despite losing at the quarter-finals stage. Based on the latest ranking, Anyanacho is now 6th  in Africa behind Ruth Gbagbi of Cote D’Ivoire [3], Egypt’s Hedaya Malak [14], Gabon’s Urgence Mouega [37], Marie Frederique Ekpitini of Cote D’Ivoire [57] and Wafae El Atri of Morocco [57]. She said:  “It is just number on a table but seeing the improved ranking is motivating because it shows that I have been working extremely hard in training. Certainly, we want to be on the top at some point and the only way to get there is to keep going. Our current target is to be in the top 20 in the world.”
