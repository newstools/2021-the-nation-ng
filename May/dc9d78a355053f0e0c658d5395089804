The Police in Jigawa have arrested five suspects over alleged attack of Malam Yakubu Ibrahim, the Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC), Dutse Local Government Area. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Usman Gomna, confirmed the arrest to newsmen in Dutse on Wednesday. The police boss explained that the suspects allegedly invaded the party secretariat in the local government area during a meeting on Monday and forcefully took the chairman to an unknown location. According to him, while held captive by his attackers, the chairman was cajoled to declare their choice candidate as chairman for the forthcoming council elections in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) gathered that the development followed the announcement of names of candidates that would contest for chairmen in the 27 local government areas of the state. It was alleged that some of the party supporters and members were not satisfied with the name of the person announced by the party to contest for the chairmanship election in the council. The CP also debunked the rumour in some quarters that the party chairman was kidnapped. “This has nothing to do with kidnapping, because the suspects did not demand for money before they released him. “It is just intraparty crisis, of which we advised them to solve amicably. “However, the police have arrested five out of the 10 suspects alleged to have committed the offence.
“So, the police have already intervened and normalcy had returned in the area,” the CP said. He, however, assured that the police would soon arrest the other fleeing suspects. NAN reports that the Jigawa State Independent Electoral Commission (JISIEC) has slated June 26 for the conduct of the council elections. (NAN)
