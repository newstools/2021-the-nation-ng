The Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) says it will henceforth profile herdsmen entering the country at Jigawa, through our common border with Niger Republic. Mr Isma’il Abba, NIS Controller in Jigawa, stated this while speaking at the decoration of 58 recently promoted officers. He said the decision was aimed at tackling the annual influx of camels into the state through the common border. “We have directed our officers at the borders and entry points to properly profile and document herdsmen. “Every migrant will be stopped and their luggage thoroughly searched, stating their mission and destination,” he said. Meanwhile, Abba has described the promoted officers as good ambassadors of the NIS who had displayed hard work and commitment to service. “Your promotion is a call for more hard work, it is time to show more commitment to duty,” he said. The controller urged the officers in the command to also exude discipline in carrying out their duties. “The service does not tolerate improper dressing from officers, any officer found guilty of this shall be punished,” he said. He said that the NIS Comptroller-General, Mr Muhammad Babandede had zero tolerance for indiscipline and laziness, saying, “dereliction of duty and absenteeism are offences that must be reported to the headquarters”.
