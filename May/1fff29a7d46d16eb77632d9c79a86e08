 A Sharia Court judge has been abducted in Katsina State. Judge Hussaini Samaila was kidnapped on Tuesday on a court premises located between Baure and Zakka villages in Safana Local Government Area of the state. Police spokesman Gambo Isah confirmed the incident yesterday in Katsina, the state capital, adding that the jurist was kidnapped about 3pm. The area is rife with kidnapping and banditry, and Isah wondered why the judge went there without a court orderly or security escort. All courts are closed in the state due to the judiciary workers’ strike.  It was gathered that Judge Samaila went to the court to take something. “It is true that the judge, Hussaini Samaila has been abducted while the courts are on strike. The court had stopped sitting in that area for long,” Isah said. “The judge went to the area alone to take something in the court without a court orderly or police escort, knowing full well the insecurity challenges in that area. “Even if he had to go there, he should have asked for security cover and we would have given him considering his position. “We are investigating the issue to find out the reality, and why he should put himself in such danger.”
