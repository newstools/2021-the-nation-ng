The All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on Nigerians to continue to support ongoing efforts by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to bring a permanent solution to the country`s security challenges. Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, National Secretary, APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), made the call in a statement on Thursday in Abuja. He welcomed the release of the 29 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka in Kaduna State, by bandits. He said that it was truly heartwarming news to know that the students had been reunited with their families, friends and other loved ones. “We deeply appreciate all stakeholders involved in the students’ release, while the party and government share concerns of well-meaning Nigerians on the security incidents in the country. “We reiterate our call to Nigerians for the continued support of ongoing efforts by the President Buhari government at a quick and permanent solution to the security challenges,’’ he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that gunmen abducted 39 students from the school on March 11 and had previously released ten of them. The newly released students arrived at the police headquarters in Kaduna on Wednesday night, all looking wearied and spent. According to reports, one female student was carried into the building, because she could not walk all by herself, while another was rushed to the hospital. (NAN)
