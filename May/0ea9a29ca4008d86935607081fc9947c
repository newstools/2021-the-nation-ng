Federal Government has warned practitioners of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) to desist or risk N500, 000 fine or four years imprisonment. The Oyo State Director, National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mrs. Folake Ayoola, speaking at a two-day capacity building for stakeholders for the implementation of policies to end FGM, held in Oyo town, urged FGM practitioners to desist from such practice and take up other legal jobs as a means of livelihood. She said anyone caught in the act would be made to pay a fine of N500,000 or risk four years imprisonment. The Executive Director, HACEY Health Initiative, Mrs. Rhoda Robinson, said the training was aimed at building the capacity of FGM Alliance members to understand strategic policies and also share ideas on how to end FGM across Nigeria, adding that the programme would further improve knowledge and implementation of policies that would protect women from FGM. Oyo State Commissioner for Health Dr. Bashir Bello, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Muftau Ayoola, called for awareness on the consequences of FGM for local circumcisers to quit the barbaric act as well as those who patronise them.
