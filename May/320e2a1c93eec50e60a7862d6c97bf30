In recognition of the strong underlying fundamentals driving its business, Datapro has reaffirmed an ‘A’ rating on the Nova Merchant Bank’s N10 billion seven-Year Subordinated Unsecured Bond. The bond was issued under its N50 billion debt issuance programme with a fixed coupon rate of 12 per cent yearly. This achievement follows the recent publication of the bank’s financial results for 2020 in which it declared a profit after tax of N3.49 billion in 2020 compared to N1.65 billion in 2019. The bank also achieved a 130 per cent increase in gross earnings while its cost to income ratio declined from 55 per cent in 2019 to 44 per cent in 2020. Its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Nath Ude, said: ‘A’ rating builds on the bank’s recent strong financial performance and further validates our go to market approach, business model and value proposition to our customers. It rewards the bank for the resilience it has shown during the challenging economic environment arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.” The Chairman of Nova Merchant Bank, Phillips Oduoza,  noted: “This rating recognises the progress the bank has made in such a short period of time amid a challenging macroeconomic context. The Board remains committed to supporting the management team towards the achievement of many more successful milestones as the bank’s growth trajectory continues to demonstrate long term sustainability.”
