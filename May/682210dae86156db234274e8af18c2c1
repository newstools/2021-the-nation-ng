All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain Sen. Tokunbo Abiru has described his father, Justice Mubasheer Akanbi Abiru, as a progressive leader worthy of pride. The late jurist was a Second Republic senator on the platform of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), led by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo.  He passed on 25 years ago. In a statement, Sen. Abiru said his father’s demise left a big vacuum in the Abiru family of Ikorodu, the entire community and the progressive bloc in Nigeria. However, he said his children, associates and loved ones have continued to cherish the memory of his life of honour, integrity and service, not only to Lagos State, but also to the country. According to the senator from the Lagos East District, the legacies of Justice Abiru were evergreen. He described the deceased lawyer, jurist, politician and community leader as a mentor and a role model, who inspired many through his patriotism, honesty and decency. Sen. Abiru said: “As an ideologue and committed Awoist, you were loyal to the creed of ‘Freedom for all, life more abundant’, just as you were noted for your disdain for avarice and primitive accumulation. “As a Senator of the Federal Republic on the platform of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), you and your compatriots made a difference as credible opposition voices canvassing an alternative route to good governance, economic growth and democratic consolidation. “As a judge you served on the bench without blemish.” He added: “We, your surviving children, are building on your good legacies in private and public life. “Our prayer is that the Almighty Allah should continue to grant you Aljannah Fidaus.”
