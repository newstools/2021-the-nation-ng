The Super Falcons will take on the Reggae Queens of Jamaica on Tuesday, June 10, in their opening game of the USA Summer Series. The venue is the BBVA Stadium in Houston, Texas, and kick-off is 10.30pm in Nigeria. The Nine-time African champions will then face Portugal four days later at the same venue. The Falcons will wrap up their participation with a final game against hosts USA on June 17 at the Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas. Nigeria will use this competition as part of their build-up for a tricky African Women’s Championship eliminator against arch-rivals Ghana, which has now been moved to October. Meanwhile, The USA have included Nigerian goalkeeper Chituru Odunze in a 27-man squad for a friendly against Switzerland on May 30 in St. Gallen, which will serve as preparation for the CONCACAF Nations League Final Four in early June. The 18-year-old goalkeeper, who plays for Leicester City, is being called to the US senior national team for the first time. Daryl Dike, who has been outstanding for England Championship team Barnsley, is also on the squad list. Odunze is currently playing for Leicester City’s U18 and U23 teams. He previously played for Vancouver Whitecaps and has represented USA at U17 and U20 levels.
