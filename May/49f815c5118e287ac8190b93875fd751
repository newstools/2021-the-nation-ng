Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho has said he would not greet or sympathise with Redeemed Christian Church of God(RCCG) General Overseer, Pastor Adeboye, over the demise of his son, Dare. The Nation reports Adeboye’s son, Dare, 42, died in his sleep on Tuesday, May 4 in Eket, Akwa-Ibom where he was pastoring a church. He explained that Adeboye is not in support of his Yoruba nation’s cause. Igboho in the now-viral video did not mince words when he rained curses on any leader or Pastor who refuses to support the secession agenda, saying God will kill their children and wives. Igboho’s aide, Olayomi Koiki, in the video had asked him (Igboho) to commiserate with Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), over the death of his son, Dare Adeboye. But the visibly infuriated Igboho asked if the man of God had declared his support for the Yoruba nation. He said: “Has Baba supported the Yoruba nation that we will now be greeting him? We don’t need to greet Adeboye. What is my own with that? We are not doing church here. This is not religion. “What we are doing is not about religion. Even our clerics are blocking our path. We don’t need to commiserate with Adeboye, what’s my business with that? “Adeboye has never spoken about the Yoruba issue. Look at how huge his congregation is, why hasn’t he spoken for the Yoruba Nation? We don’t need to commiserate with him. “God himself will judge those who have not supported us, may He continue to kill their wives and children since they don’t want us to reach our promised land. “Whoever does not support Yoruba Nation but have the crowd in their churches, God I invoke you, you own me and everything I own belongs to you, and they have seen how Fulanis kidnap us and demand ransom, continue to kill their wives and children. So be it!”
