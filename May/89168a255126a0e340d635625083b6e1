Yoruba movie star, Adams Kehinde aka Lege Miami has tendered a public apology to the umbrella body of Yoruba actors and filmmakers, TAMPAN, over his social media spat with his colleague, Nkechi Blessing. While Lege Miami appeared remorseful, his colleague, Nkechi Blessing disregarded TAMPAN’s notice of suspension calling their bluff. The Nation reported the national body of Theatre Arts and Motion Pictures Practitioners Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN) suspended them from appearing on Yoruba movie sets indefinitely over unruly acts and exchange of detrimental verbal utterances on Instagram which was disrespectful to the association’s image and profession. Nkechi Blessing initiated the social media outburst as her colleague, Lege Miami appeared sympathetic towards Baba Ijesha’s plight. TAMPAN’s Guild of Directors, chaired by Damola Olatunji, “decreed” that no director should engage the services of the two actors, adding anyone who does contrary will likewise be subject to further punitive measure. Meanwhile, Lege Miami has appealed his suspension while Nkechi Blessing renounced her association with TAMPAN in an Instagram live video with a popular blogger on Monday evening. In a minute video, he captioned “(I) am sorry” on his social media page, Lege Miami tendered his unreserved apology to the “pillars” of TAMPAN while he played a song by veteran Fuji singer, Adewale Ayuba, further pleading forgiveness. The actress, on the other hand, questioned the rationale behind her suspension adding that every individual has a right to air their opinion(s) on their social media platforms. Moreover, they were not involved in a physical fight. The actress went further to ask a rhetorical question. She asked; “How do you suspend me when I have never been part of your association?”
