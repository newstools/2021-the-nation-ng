Stefano Pioli has confirmed AC Milan want to sign Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori on a permanent deal. Tomori moved to Milan on loan in January after falling down the squad pecking order at Stamford Bridge, and has since rediscovered his best form at San Siro. The 23-year-old played a starring role once again as the Rossoneri beat arch-rivals Juventus 3-0 in Serie A on Sunday, with Pioli revealing after the game that the club intends to exercise their £26 million ($37m) purchase option on the centre-back. “We want to buy Tomori on a permanent deal from Chelsea,” the Milan boss told reporters. “Our intention is clear and also Fikayo’s decision (staying at Milan). We’ll see what happens at the end of the season.”
