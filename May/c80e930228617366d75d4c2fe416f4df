Real Madrid earned a 4-1 win at Granada to keep their La Liga title defence alive. Zinedine Zidane’s side triumphed in Andalusia on Thursday and moved second, on 78 points from 36 games, two points behind leaders Atletico Madrid. Luka Modric fired Real Madrid ahead in the 17th minute and Rodrygo Goes doubled the lead with his first goal of the season as the visitors dominated. Jorge Molina pulled a goal back for Granada but Real Madrid quickly restored their advantage through Alvaro Odriozola and Karim Benzema wrapped up the win from distance. “The only thing we can keep doing is chasing Atletico Madrid and hope they don’t win,” said Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. “We have to make sure they don’t have any margin for error. They won and all we can do is look at ourselves, and focus on the difficult game at Athletic Bilbao, which is another final.” Atletico Madrid beat Real Sociedad on Wednesday to take control of La Liga and the title will be theirs if they win their remaining two matches. Youngster Miguel Gutierrez was making his first start for Real Madrid and it was a game to remember for him, as he fed a fine pass through for Modric to open the scoring. Rodrygo’s low finish just before half-time gave Real Madrid a commanding lead, but they slowed down in the second half. Zidane’s side are exhausted and at times it showed, with Los Blancos having suffered more injuries this season than their title rivals. After Molina pulled a goal back, Real Madrid might have wobbled but substitute Eden Hazard set up Odriozola to blast home from inside the area. Benzema’s fourth settled the clash, with the Frenchman finishing from 35 yards out with Granada goalkeeper Rui Silva out of his area. Elsewhere, Real Valladolid lost 2-0 at home against Villarreal, meaning they stay 18th, two points from safety. Bottom-of-the-table Eibar drew 1-1 with Real Betis and are three points behind Huesca, who are 17th.(dpa/NAN)
