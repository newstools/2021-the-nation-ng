The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Task Force) at the weekend seized 10 vehicles for plying against traffic along the Muritala Mohammed International Airport Road. The vehicles were seized on Friday night by a team led by task force chairman Shola Jejeloye. The Taskforce listed the impounded vehicles as Sinotruck (LND26XW), Toyota Corolla (BDG935FY), A-Zebra (AGL18AH), Ford Limited (PF3622SPY), Toyota Matrix (KSF15DS), Highlander (LSD01GR), Toyota Hiace (GGE506XZ), Mini Bus (BDG484TC), Toyota Hilux (KJA392XT) and Toyota Hilux (AAA987ET). A statement released yesterday by the agencyâ€™s spokesperson Femi Moliki said drivers caught against traffic would be prosecuted in addition to the owner forfeiting such vehicle. Moliki said the decision to start prosecuting drivers was premised on the realisation that people still engaged in the practice despite the forfeiture and auction policy of the government.
