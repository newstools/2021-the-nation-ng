A new vaccination a study conducted by Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University has found that China’s Sinovac Vaccine has extremely high efficacy in boosting immune responses against COVID-19, according to media reports yesterday. The study run by the Centre of Excellence in Clinical Virology of the Faculty of Medicine at the university showed that 99.49 per cent of the recipients had developed anti-body responses four weeks after their second shots, the Bangkok Post said, quoting the study results. Three weeks after the first shot, around 66 per cent of the recipients had developed immune responses, the report added.  The number of anti-bodies against the Coronavirus was measured with Roche Elecsys Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay, qualitative detection of total anti-bodies developed against the virus in people’s blood samples before and after the vaccination period said the research group. Electrochemiluminescence or electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) is a kind of luminescence produced during electrochemical reactions in solutions. The tests were conducted before injections, three weeks after the first shot and four weeks after the second injection.
