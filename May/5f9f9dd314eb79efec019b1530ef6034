Lagos State Government yesterday pledged to foster sustainable industrial harmony for a more prosperous state. Establishments, Training and Pensions Commissioner Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle said there is a need for labour leaders to follow the path of dialogue in conflict resolution, as against considering the option of embarking on industrial action. She said the labour leaders must always engage the government in discourse, instead of incessant strikes as often witnessed, though not in Lagos, but peculiar to unions all over the world. Mrs. Ponnle, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Abiodun Onayele, made this known while declaring open a training programme for labour leaders in Ikeja. She hailed the industrial harmony enjoyed under the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in the last two years. Noting that it was heartwarming that the current administration had not experienced any industrial action by Labour unions, she attributed the feat to creative thinking, innovativeness, approach to union issues and management of situations by the leadership of the state, adding that as it is, “Lagos State will continue to maintain that relationship and more importantly, no request or suggestions made by the union leaders will be swept under the carpet.” The Special Adviser to the Governor on Labour and Industrial Relations, Mr. Babatunde Williams, advised the participants to be attentive and serious.
