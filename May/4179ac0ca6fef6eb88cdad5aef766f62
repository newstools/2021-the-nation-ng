Aloma, former personal assistant of music superstar Davido, has alleged he was offered N100m to indict the music star in the death of one of his friends, Tagbo. Aloma made this known during a chat with veteran rapper Jahbless in his podcast ‘Original Intelligence’ shared on the rapper’s Instagram page on Thursday. During the chat, Aloma said: “Even my mama called me to tell am the truth…the interesting part is, this is the first time I’ll say this on air. As we dey Lion building, Tagbo lawyer show, one person show I no wan talk the person name and the DPO. “Now dem say I be fall man. Them carrry me go one room, dem say I be fall man. Baba fear industry ooo. I no go lie, dem dey try every possible thing to just draw this guy down, this David. “Dem say I be fall man say make I just write statement say na baddest, na David kill am say e send …baba blank check dey 100million. I swear to God Almighty. Say make I write am say Tagbo, na David kill am, I dey tell you.” He stated that despite having written several statements, they insisted he should write one indicting Davido for the death of his friend, Tagbo. Aloma kept reiterating the fact that he was being referred to as a “fall man.” It would be recalled that Tagbo passed away mysteriously in 2017. The news of his death broke the Internet in 2017 not because he was famous but of the circumstances surrounding his death. Tagbo was reportedly last seen with Davido and his crew before his sudden death. The news of his death was announced by Nollywood actress, Caroline Danjuma, who claimed to be a close friend to the deceased. She went on to call out Davido over his involvement in Tagbo’s death.
