 Mongolia has decided not to publicly celebrate the upcoming International Children’s Day due to the COVID-19 pandemic, local media reported on Tuesday, citing the country’s State Emergency Commission. The decision made by the commission has part of the country’s efforts to prevent a further spread of the pandemic, as gatherings during the holiday could lead to surging infections. International Children’s Day was established in 1949 by the Women’s International Democratic Federation to safeguard the rights and interests of children. Currently, many countries annually celebrate the day on June 1. In 1996, Mongolia officially designated the day as an official public holiday. (Xinhua/NAN)
