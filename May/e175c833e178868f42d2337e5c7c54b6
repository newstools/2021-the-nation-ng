The quick intervention of the Minister of Youth and sports Development Mr Sunday Dare has rescued the women’s national Handball team from missing participation at the Nations Cup in Cameroon as delayed funding threatened their build-up. Dare had on May 5 visited the team at their Abuja camp in company of the head of the HFN Caretaker Committee Sam Ocheho where he charged them to ensure they pick one of the World Cup slots allocated to Africa with an assurance to make funds available. An elated Ocheho thanked the Minister for coming to the team’s aid: We are grateful to the Minister for making good his promise to provide fund for the Nations Cup:Although the money was approved by the Minister but the process of getting it released was getting tough. “Thanks to the Minister’s intervention, part of the money was released to enable us buy tickets and attend to other important needs. So excited that we are returning to the Nations Cup after more than 26 years absence.” The team intensified their preparations by defeating FCT Under-18 Boys 36-26 last Wednesday. Two days later, they narrowly defeated the Niger State Under-21 Men’s team but lost to Suleja Shooters 31-29 on Saturday, at the Indoor Sports Hall of the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. The Women’s national team will as part of their preparations play their last tune-up match lastbTuesday.The national team has been in camp since May 2 under the supervision of Coach Rafiu Salami.
