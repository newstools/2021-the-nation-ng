Former Nigerian striker Jonathan Akpoborie is  optimistic  that Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr will qualify Nigeria for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The Super Eagles, who qualified for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations unbeaten, have been pitted alongside Liberia, Cape Verde, and Central Africa Republic (CAR) in the second round of the 2022 CAF World Cup qualifiers. Nigeria’s first game, coming up in June this year, will be against the Lone Stars of Liberia, who reached this stage after shoving neighbours Sierra Leone in the first round. The three-time African Champions are favourites as none of their opponents have played at the Fifa World cup. But the former Wolfsburg striker stated that the team has what it takes to qualify for the Mundial. He noted that Rohr has built a team capable of beating any team in his group and expects the German tactician to select the right players for any game. “I expect the Super Eagles to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup going by the calibre of players in Gernot Rohr’s disposal,” the former Stuttgart striker told Soccernet.ng “Despite being grouped alongside Liberia, Cape Verde, and Central Africa Republic (CAR), I really don’t see the team struggling to qualify. This team will get the job clean and smooth. “Yes, there no minnows in football, however, I know the team has what it takes to overcome some of the teams in our group. The final round will only be the most difficult but I still believe our boys will get the job done.” Since making their debut in the quadrennial tournament in USA 1994, Nigeria has only failed once to qualify for the competition in 2006. The three-time African champions were eliminated at the group stage of the 2018 edition in Russia after securing only three points from three games following a victory against Iceland and losses to Croatia and Argentina. The West Africans’ best outings in the competition were in 1994, 1998, and 2014 where they reached the Round of 16.
