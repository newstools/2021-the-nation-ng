There is no doubt that marriage comes with a change of lifestyle whereby certain habits common to singles are dropped by married couples. This is not any different for a celebrity couple, claimed artiste and songwriter, Musicbysire (full name Olorunsogo Michael Oni) who recently got married to his sweetheart, actress Aisat Iyabode Asamu, popularly known as Aishy. According to him: “Before marriage, I did flirt a lot with women here and there. That was something I had to cut off totally and repent from. Of course, I had to block a couple of people from my contact list too. Man has got to do what he got to for peace to rein in his home.” Both Aishy and Musicbysire are popular and each has a large fan base even before their marriage. The artiste avowed that marriage will not affect how he and Aishy will continue to relate with their fan as a couple. “It’s always been on a professional note with fans, and based on love and support, we always gonna be the same,” he noted. Continuing, he said: “Support is one of the major reasons for having, in the first place, a partner, someone that can push you to be better in your craft, skills and profession.” Of his wife, he said: “She supports me big time. I can say she is my support system in everything I do, and I, on the other hand, don’t have a choice but to support her. I’m making moves and connects every day to ensure that my wife becomes a megastar.” Speaking on the importance of marriage, Musicbysire offered his opinion: “Based of what happened in the Bible in the Garden of Eden, man needed a helpmate for life to be much easier for him and then God created woman; that should tell the importance of a woman’s role in a man’s life.” He said further: “I don’t have to justify the importance because it’s not important to a whole lot of people, so I will say each individual should find what gives them peace and makes them happy in the end.”
