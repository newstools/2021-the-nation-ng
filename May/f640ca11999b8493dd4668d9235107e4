A witness who claimed to be a sister to the wife said Ekene always beat his wife even during pregnancy. She said, “The baby was strapped to the back of Rose when her husband, Ekene, started a verbal attack on her before it resulted in a physical combat. “I didn’t see it as anything as they usually have such fight and make amends after. But this time, it was the other way round as the disagreement degenerated into a physical combat which eventually claimed the life of the innocent baby. “The baby was hale and hearty before the incident. I removed the baby from her back and placed him on the bed. That was when I realised the baby was lifeless.” The baby was said to be declared dead on arrival at a health centre in the community. Olisa of Eleyowo, Chief Eso Ojo, described the incident as bad saying such a case has never happened in the community. “Many times, there have been reports on the couple and it’s unfortunate it ended this way. “I appeal for calm. The case is being handled by the Ondo State Police command.” Ondo Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, could not be reached for comments.
