Delta state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa on Saturday hit back at the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan and others for saying that Southern Governors are not supposed to speak on the issues of restructuring and the need for a national dialogue. Okowa who spoke at an empowerment Programme sponsored by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Rep. Ndudi Elumelu in Asaba said it was unfortunate that the Senate President was quoted as saying that Southern Governors should not have taken the position they took. The Senate President was quoted to have criticised the southern governors for their position saying as elected people, they are not supposed to be seen to take such a position. He said what the southern governors said was not new as such positions has variously been canvassed by Nigerians including the APC and PDP. He said “unfortunately, I read in the paper somebody saying that we ought not to speak on certain things because we are elected people. If you cannot echo the voice of your people, then you are not worthy of tht position you are holding. “All those things that we said in our communique are not new. They have been spoken by our people and what we did was just echo their wishes.”
