The stage is set for the first-ever Governor Douye Diri National Scrabble Championship, which holds this weekend in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital. Almost 400 participants from across Nigeria and Europe, including former world champion, Wellington Jighere as well as no fewer than four former African champions have booked their participation for the scrabble showpiece. The three-day championship is approved by the Nigeria Scrabble Federation (NSF) with some of its officials already in the state to ensure a hitch-free competition. Chairman of the Bayelsa State Scrabble Association (BYSA), Mr. Daniel Alabrah, who confirmed this to reporters in Yenagoa, said the scrabble community in the state was upbeat and that preparations were in the final stages. Alabrah, who is also the Chief Press Secretary to the Bayelsa State Governor, said the interest from secondary schools in the state was quite encouraging and that many schools have equally registered their students. Alabrah however noted that sponsorship for the championship had been a challenge even as he commended the state governor, Senator Douye Diri, for his commitment to sports development and for encouraging youth participation in sports generally.
