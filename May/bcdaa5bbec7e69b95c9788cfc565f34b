Tottenham’s hopes of securing European football will be decided on the final day of the Premier League season after Aston Villa came from behind to claim victory in front of 10,000 fans at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. As speculation increases about Harry Kane’s future before the summer transfer window, chants of “He’s one of our own” were sung by the returning home fans, who were welcomed back by Steven Bergwijn’s thumping eighth-minute opener after he had stolen possession from Marvellous Nakamba. Villa’s response deserved an equaliser and it was Sergio Reguilon who delivered it as the Spurs left-back sliced Nakamba’s cross into the top corner of Hugo Lloris’ goal. Ollie Watkins completed the turnaround before half-time, collecting Reguilon’s weak clearance and holding off the challenge of Eric Dier before finding the bottom corner to continue his fine first season in the top flight. Watkins was thwarted by Lloris either side of half-time, and although Spurs did test Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez more regularly following the restart through Bergwijn and Kane, they failed to find an equaliser. Defeat leaves Spurs in sixth, level on points with West Ham United – who face West Bromwich Albion later – and Everton going into Sunday’s final round of fixtures. BBC
