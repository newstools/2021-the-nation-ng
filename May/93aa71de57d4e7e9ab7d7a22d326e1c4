Anthony Joshua has joked that he is going to set up a Go Fund Me page to raise money to pay off Deontay Wilder after the American heavyweight won his legal battle to get a third fight with Tyson Fury. After months of negotiations, AJ appeared to have finally struck a deal to fight Fury in a mammoth undisputed bout in Saudi Arabia in August only for the event to be derailed after an American judge ruled that Wilder was entitled to a trilogy fight with the Gypsy King. Fury dismantled his rival in Las Vegas in February 2020 – the last time either man fought – but there was a clause in their contract which entitled the loser to yet another rematch. There have been suggestions that Wilder might be convinced to step aside and allow for the Battle of Britain to take place – and then take on the victor at a later date – but the Bronze Bomber will only give up his title shot for a huge fee. According to Joshua, Wilder is asking for an astonishing £20million to step aside and the Brit took aim at both the American and Fury on social media, suggesting neither man really wants to fight him. “‘I’m thinking about starting a Go Fund Me page to raise money for Wilder’s step-aside payment so I can smoke that fat guy with skinny legs from Manchester,” wrote Joshua on Instagram, quoting the supposed £20m fee. “These heavyweights need a podcast or something because they do more talking than fighting.” Fury’s promoter, Bob Arum, says a deal for the lineal champion to fight Wilder – not Joshua – in Las Vegas on July 24 has already been pencilled in, with AJ’s promoter Eddie Hearn now working on a showdown with Oleksandr Usyk.
