The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has warned against alleged subterranean moves by some groups to introduce Sharia Law in the South West through the ongoing constitutional review by the Senate. It warned the Senate not to succumb to such agitations capable of further plunging the country into a major religious crisis. A statement from the media office of PFN President, Bishop Francis Wale Oke, on Thursday said rather, the lawmakers should direct their energies towards solving the mounting problems bedeviling the country, especially the security of lives and property of the populace. “The problems confronting our nation are enormous than wanting to create more. Sharia Law is alien to our culture of religious existence in the South-West. “As such, nobody should through any subterfuge, bring it in so as to cause the crisis,” the body stated. Introduction of such law to the South West, the PFN warned would pitch Christians against their Muslim counterparts. “We want to strongly warn the Senate and those behind this plan to unsettle the peace being enjoyed in this country, to desist before it’s too late. “Don’t instigate religious crisis in the Southwest; this could further threaten the fragile peace of the country,” it further charged Continuing, the PFN noted: “The secularity of our existence which is devoid of any religious upheaval, should not be tampered with under whatever guise. We shall resist this by every legal means at our disposal “Without the Sharia, we have always lived peacefully with our Muslim brothers. We know that this is the handiwork of those who are hell-bent in unsettling our country at all cost. But the good news is that: They have failed. As far as we are concerned, the proposal won’t fly and can never fly. It’s dead born.”
