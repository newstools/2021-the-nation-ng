Amber Drinks Ltd has announced the continuation of its empowerment program designed to empower unemployed Nigerians, retailers, startups and students. Since its formal launch in 2020, its purpose has been to make life easier for Nigerians on their journey to being their own boss, and this time they are set to empower even more.
