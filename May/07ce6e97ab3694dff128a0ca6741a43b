Real Madrid are closing in on a deal that will add highly reputed sporting director Luis Campos to their ranks, with Goal learning that further talks are planned for next week. The Blancos are in the process of remodelling on the back of a first trophy-less campaign since the tenure of Manuel Pellegrini in 2009-10. Sources have revealed to Goal that discussions with Campos, who once filled a scouting and tactical analyst role for the Liga giants under Jose Mourinho , have been ongoing for at least two months. Those on both sides of the talks have been eager to ensure that future planning presented no distraction to efforts on the field. Campos and his representatives have the utmost respect for Zidane and wanted full focus in Madrid to be locked on bids for major silverware. That proved elusive, leading the legendary French coach to walk away and open up one of the most demanding roles in world football.
