A Coalition of Civil Society Organization, CSOs, have warned about the danger of looming food scarcity in Katsina. The CSOs said this is occasioned by increasing banditry attacks particularly on farmers and the denial of access to farming activities in the state. The Coalition who gathered at the Katsina NUJ Secretariat to mark this year’s national day of mourning for victims of violence and killings across the country were united in affirming that the spate of attacks if unchecked may trigger food crisis in the state, adding that urgent and drastic measures require to be taken by government and security agencies. The State Chairman of CSOs, Mr. Abdurrahman Abdullahi Dutsin-ma, while addressing the gathering warned that the impending food crisis in the state, which is as a result of lull in farming activities caused by increasing attacks by bandits and other criminals, should be tackled once and for all by the state government and security agencies. He said; “the state government had done well in curtailing insecurity but more needed to be done to enable farmers to commence farming activities’’ “As the rainy season is fast approaching, security measures needed to be provided to enable our farmers to harvest their farmlands because, with the way things are going, farmers will find it difficult to cultivate their land which may cause a serious food security not to the state alone but the entire country at large.” He further commended the state government for its plan to assist victims of banditry, particularly orphans and widows, in terms of free education, healthcare services and supportive feeding and insisted that more efforts should be put in place to ensure sustainable peace in the state. Other speakers at the rally called on the youths to partner with government and security agencies in tackling insecurity in the land, arguing that government alone cannot solve our present security challenges, without the support of all.
