There are strong indications that the Super Eagles would feature in a four-nation tournament in Austria. This development was made known through a source closed to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) that the tournament became necessary following the postponement of the Qatar 2022 World Cup Qualifiers by FIFA to September as the Coach Gernot Rohr-tutored side was initially expected to face Lone Star of Liberia and Cape Verde next month for the World Cup qualifiers. The source revealed that plans are in top gear to have Senegal, Cameroon and yet to be named team to be part of the tournament scheduled to be held in Austria. However, NationSport had earlier confirmed that NFF has been shopping for friendly matches for Eagles in their bid to keep the team in top shape for the September qualifiers as most of the European leagues would be on break for months before the qualifiers begin. Also, coach Rohr has confirmed that the NFF must look at the possibility of getting friendly matches to keep the players in top shape as most European leagues will soon be on break. “We have to organise friendlies now and we already have some African countries in mind,” noted the former Bayern Munich defender.
