President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, held a closed-doors meeting with former President Goodluck Jonathan, over developments in Mali’s political crisis. It would be recalled that former President Jonathan is Special Envoy and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) mediator to the West African country. According to a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, President Buhari called on the actors in the political crisis in Mali to come together for the peace and unity of the country.  According to President Buhari, “a situation where most parts of the country are in the hands of insurgents calls for a consensus and restoration of peace, not a further escalation of the crisis.” Former President Goodluck had briefed the President on the current situation in Mali after meeting with the key political actors ahead of the meeting of ECOWAS leaders under the Chairmanship of President Nana Akufo-Addo of the Republic of Ghana. He added that the meeting of the regional leaders was necessary to urgently find an acceptable solution to the current impasse in the West African nation.
