Karim Benzema has been named in France’s 26-man squad for this summer’s Euro 2020 tournament with the Real Madrid star earning a recall from Didier Deschamps to the national team for the first time in six years. Benzema had been a key figure for France since making his debut in 2007, but the forward fell out of favour with the national team program due to his alleged involvement in the Mathieu Valbuena sex tape scandal. However, he has rejoined the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann in the French squad as world champions Les Bleus seek to shine at the Euros this summer.
