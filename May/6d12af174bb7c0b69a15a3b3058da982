Real Madrid have confirmed the signing of utility man David Alaba on a free transfer following the expiration of his contract at Bayern Munich. The 28-year-old Austria international, capable of excelling at left-back, central defence or in midfield, chose to end his long association with Bayern at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. Several leading European clubs had been linked with his signature, but Alaba has chosen to continue his career at Santiago Bernabeu. Real confirmed that Alaba has signed a five-year deal at the club and will join up with his new team-mates after the European Championships, at which Alaba will be a key figure in the Austrian side. Alaba arrives at Real as one of the most decorated individual footballers in Europe, having won 28 different titles after joining Bayern in 2008. These include two Champions League titles, and 10 successive Bundesliga crowns. He played 431 games for Bayern – a record for a non-German footballer – scoring 33 goals, and was named in UEFA Team of the Year three times.
