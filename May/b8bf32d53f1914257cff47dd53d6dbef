The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has announced immediate suspension of the five-day warning strike it embarked upon in Kaduna over the sack of 4,000 workers by the State Government. Its National President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, disclosed this during a press conference in Kaduna on Wednesday. According to the NLC President, the suspension is due to invitation of the leadership of NLC and Kaduna Government to map out a way forward over the impasse. While thanking Kaduna residents for their cooperation, he apologised for any inconveniences suffered during the strike. Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige had invited Labour and Kaduna Government to a meeting over the strike on Thursday. Asked what would be labour’s next step if the meeting with the Minister ends in deadlock, the NLC President said they will honour the Federal Government’s invitation and review their steps afterwards. According to him: “As far as we are concerned, we are going to honour the invitation of the Federal Government. Whatever happens will not matter, but we will be having a National Executive Councill (NEC) meeting by next Tuesday where we are going to review what has happened in Kaduna in the last three days. The outcome of the NEC meeting will determine our next line of action.”
