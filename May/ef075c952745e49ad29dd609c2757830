 The Lagos State Lotteries Board (LSLB) has announced the Eko Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (EKO STEM) quiz for public and low-cost private secondary schools in the state. Over 1,500 pupils are expected to register through their schools – with each school presenting two candidates. The competition, starting in June, is open to SS1 and SS2 pupils who will be tested in Agricultural Science, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and Technology. Winners will be rewarded with prizes – with the ultimate prize being a full higher institution scholarship. Preliminary examination for the competition will hold on Saturday in 20 centres.  Successful candidates will move to the next stage of writing the Computer Based Test (CBT) on May 29. Twelve successful candidates participate in the studio finals where two schools will feature monthly for six months. Six successful candidates from the 12 will compete against each other in the final to produce three winners. General Manager of LSLB Bashir Are said the competition is to address the shortfall in the sector, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the laws establishing the LSLB empowers it to intervene, financially, in education, infrastructure, environment, health and social sectors of the state. “Revenue generated by the Lagos State Lotteries Board are paid into a Distribution Trust Fund. The fund, by virtue of Section 33 of the Lagos State Lotteries (Amendment) Law 2008, is applied towards executing good cause projects in infrastructure, education, environment, social, health and sports development,” he noted. Senior Special Adviser to Governor Bababjide Sanwo-Olu on State Lotteries, Ms. Funmi Olotu, who gave an overview of the quiz, said the show would be pre-recorded and aired monthly on selected television stations and social media.
