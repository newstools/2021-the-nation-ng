Davido’s lawyer, Bobo F. Ajudua has finally cleared the air on who wrote the hit single ‘Jowo’ for his client after he was accused of stealing it from Victor Ad. Davido was called out by a fan who claimed the award-winning singer stole his hit single ‘Jowo’ from Victor AD. According to him, Victor AD revealed the same during an interview. This allegation led to quite a heated controversy on social media and eventually forced the “Tire you” singer to come out and put paid to every rumour monger. Victor AD emphatically stated he did not write the song “Jowo” and was baffled at where the viral rumours emanated from. Red Eye went further to urge those who delight in propagating false news to allow “Omo Baba Olowo” crooner bask in the euphoria of his 10th-year celebration as a king on stage. Meanwhile, Davido’s lawyer, Prince Bobo in a new post on his Twitter handle disclosed every information that has to do with the song, “Jowo’ from the performer to the writers and the producers. Bobo tweeted: “As far as I know, Jowo was performed by Davido, written by David Adeleke & Oladeinde Okubajo aka @Davido & @Deindeofficial and prod by Jerry Jethro & Peter A. Kehinde Emmanuel aka Napji & Majicboi. That’s as far as I know. Don’t shoot me I’m just the guy that did the paperwork.”
