Manchester United’s hope for glory in 2020/21 will be decided tomorrow when they face Samuel Chukwueze’s Villarreal in the Europa league Final. The match will air exclusively, live and in HD on StarTimes World Football channel at 8pm. The match is one of the peak in European football until UEFA Euro 2020 begins in June live on StarTimes. All matches will air on StarTimes basic bouquet at N1700 monthly (antenna users) or smart bouquet at N2200 (dish users). Nigeria’s Samuel Chukwueze has handed Villarreal a massive boost ahead of their Europa League final clash as he returns to training. Chukwueze was stretchered off in Villarreal’s semi-final clash against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium early this month. The match could very well be the Red Devils biggest game since Solskjaer became the manager in late 2018 and one that they would want to win. Of course, the Norwegian will have some tough decisions on his hands going into the game. StarTimes Nigeria PR Manager, Lazarus Ibeabuchi, said: “Football lovers in Nigeria can look forward to this exciting showpiece on StarTimes.
