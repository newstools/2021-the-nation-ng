The party may be over for fraudulent estate developers across the southwest region out to hoodwink unsuspecting members of the public as the new sheriff in town as vowed to run them out of town. Giving this charge at the weekend was the top hierarchy of the Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN). They spoke at the inauguration of new elected executives of the Osun State chapter of REDAN, while presenting certificates of return at the REDAN South-West zonal office, Lagos at the weekend. Firing the first salvo, the newly-appointed chairman of the association, Omoluabi Victor Eniola Mark, shortly receiving his certificate of return by REDAN South-West chairman, Mr Debo Adejana; General Secretary, Dr Kunle Adeyemi and the Ogun State chairman of the association, Mr. Oyebola Okusanya, warned that REDAN will not tolerate the rejection of the call by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) for all estate developers to be registered with the union in order to track illegal funds. He also noted that REDAN flush out all fraudsters who are bent on defrauding unsuspecting members of the public in the next three months of his administration. “There is no doubt that this association is all out to restore sanity in the real estate business and as well as ensure that our people follow due process from the purchase of their landed properties to building our their choice structures in the country while Osun is no exception. “Our enemies as practitioners in this business remain the fraudsters around the corner who are head bent on defrauding the unsuspecting members of the public and as a result tarnish the image our real and responsible members who diligence and uprightness remains their watchword in the business of real estate. “It is on this note that I want to sound a note of warning to erring practitioners who by their actions have shown that they have rejected the call of the EFCC that all practitioners should be identified with REDAN, with a view to track illegal funds in a section of the sector to have a rethink.”
