Brentford have been promoted to the Premier League for the first time in their history, as they won the Championship playoffs. The Bees beat 10-man Swansea City 2-0 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley Stadium, securing their first season in the top-flight of English soccer since 1946-47. That season was the first full season in England after the Second World War ended. Thomas Frank’s side scored twice early on through Ivan Toney and Emiliano Marcondes, while Swansea rarely threatened and had Jay Fulton sent off midway through the second half. Brentford lost to Fulham in the Championship playoff final last season, but there was not stopping them this time as the Bees will buzz around the Premier League next season with their ‘Moneyball’ methods in the transfer market securing promotion. Brentford took an early lead after Bryan Mbuemo was taken down by Swansea goalkeeper Freddie Woodman. Toney slotted home the spot kick coolly for his 33rd goal of the season, as the Bees were in dreamland.
