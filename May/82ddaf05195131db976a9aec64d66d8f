Fulham Head coach Scott Parker said he does not yet know whether Fulham will attempt to keep Ola Aina and Josh Maja. Striker Maja and former Chelsea defender Aina seem the most likely of Fulham’s seven on-loan players to end up playing for them in the Championship next season. He said: “I don’t know where the players are, (in terms of) what they cost and at this moment it’s not something that’s in the forefront of my mind. “There’s also other elements; finances, players’ contracts. There’s a whole load of different avenues and that’s why we need to sit down and work out the best way. “After the final game we need to sit down and work out what are the best plans to go forward; recruitment, who we buy, who we don’t buy, who we sell.”
