Nigerian international Nwankwo Simy is attracting interest from Lazio and newly-promoted Salernitana after the Crotone forward becomes the first player to score 20 Serie A goals for a relegated team since Protti’s 24 for Bari in 1995-96. The Nigerian is very popular with the Capitolos, but not only. According to what was reported by SkySport colleagues, in fact, the interest of the newly promoted Salernitana would also be on the striker. Ahead of this weekend’s Serie A, Simy will be hoping to increase his goal tally as Fiorentina could still finish in 11th place, remarkable considering they were at risk of relegation until recently, but Simy’s Crotone don’t want to end up bottom. It promises to be an intriguing final battle between hit men Simy and Dusan Vlahovic, who scored 13 and 14 goals respectively in the second half of the season, 20 and 21 overall.
