Belgian Hugo Broos has been named as the new coach of South Africa men’s national football team on a five-year deal. He is due to arrive in South Africa next week to begin his new job. His first games in charge are set to be June’s opening rounds of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers against neighbours Zimbabwe before returning home to play Ghana. The 69-year-old replaces Molefi Ntseki who was sacked in March after Bafana Bafana failed to qualify for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon. Broos led Cameroon to the 2017 Nations Cup title in Gabon as they came from behind to beat Egypt 2-1 in the final.
