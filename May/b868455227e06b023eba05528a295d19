Special Adviser on Political and Legislative Affairs, Mr. Amanam Nkanga ( Nsit Ibom ), Governor Emmanuel harped on the importance of qualitative education to the overall development of the state. He urged parents to maximize the opportunities made available by the free and compulsory education policy of the state government to enroll their wards in schools.  While reiterating his administrationâ€™s commitment to continue to improve on the welfare of the citizenry, Emmanuel also sued for the peaceful coexistence of all the citizens as a panacea for sustainable infrastructural development. SSA to the Governor on Inter-ministerial Direct Labour Coordinating Committee ( IMDLCC ), Mr. Samson Idiong stated that the construction/renovation of school facilities across the state were undertaken by his Committee in line with the state-of-emergency earlier declared by Governor Emmanuel as part of his effort to reposition the sector.
