The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to hold sessions with Nigerians via townhall meetings in the six geo-political zones just like the one he had with Nigerian citizens living in France. The party said President Buhari should be bold enough to face Nigerians at home and give account of his administration in the last six years. In a statement yesterday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party noted that it was not enough for President Buhari to visit far away France and attempt to use unsuspecting Nigerians living in Paris in a desperate effort to window dress what the party described as the shambolic economic and security situation foisted on the nation by his administration. “Our party holds as despicable that Presidency handlers could opt to ridicule Mr. President by making him to believe that Nigerians in the Diaspora could be swayed by cosmetic claims when they are aware of the contrary political, economic and security realities on ground in our country,” the PDP said. The party said it found it ludicrous that President Buhari asserted in the Paris meeting that he was committed to free and fair election, when in reality, he failed to sign the Electoral Act amendment Bill.
