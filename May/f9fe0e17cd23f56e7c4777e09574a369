Sergio Ramos admits he is hurt by Luis Enrique’s decision to leave him out of Spain’s Euro 2020 squad after the head coach decided against using all 26 slots available to him. Ramos is the most capped international player in European football history with 180 appearances, only four less than world record holder, Egypt’s Ahmed Hassan. But Ramos’ place in Spain’s European Championship squad has been in doubt since the turn of the year as the defender has only made three appearances since January 14 due to a knee injury. His appearance against Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final was his only outing since mid-March and Enrique has decided against taking a risk with the iconic defender. Ramos, who has won the World Cup and two European Championships with Spain, is not the only noticeable absentee though after Enrique opted to only pick 24 players. The head coach took the unprecedented step of not naming a single Real Madrid player in his squad, meaning Spain are set to go into a major tournament without Los Blancos representation for the first time in their history. Posting on his Instagram, Ramos said: “After a tough few months and a strange season unlike anything I have experienced in my career comes the Euro. “I have fought and worked every day, in body and soul, to be able to reach 100% for Real Madrid and the national team but things don’t always work out the way we’d like. “It pains me not to have been able to help my team more and not to play for Spain but, in this case, the best thing to do is rest, fully recover and come back next year like we’ve always done. It hurts not to represent your country, but I have to be honest and sincere. “I wish all my teammates the very best of luck and I hope we have a great Euros. I’ll be another fan cheering on from home. “A big shout to everyone and #VivaEspaña and #HalaMadrid always!”
