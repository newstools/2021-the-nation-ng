Super Eagles attacker Samuel Chukwueze got injured and had to leave the pitch on a stretcher as Villarreal beat Arsenal to book a place in this year’s Europa League finals yesterday night. The Nigerian seemed to be injured around the abdominal area and had to leave the pitch on a stretcher with youth squad Yéremi Pino replacing him in the 28th minute. The injury seems to be a reoccurrence of a groin injury that kept him out of the yellow-Submarine’s squad for a few weeks earlier in the year. The 22-year-old had to undergo surgery in Munich, Germany in February. Meanwhile, a Edinson Cavani brace was not enough as Manchester United   stumbled to a 3-2 loss away to Roma  but the Red  Devils  will join Villarreal at the finals following a  8-5 aggregate score line against the Italians.
