According to an eyewitness, the suspect who had been beaten to a pulp by the angry mob, fell ill and was rushed to the hospital for treatment where he was certified dead.

A statement by the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Yusuf Mariam explained: “Regrettably, in the bid to restore calm one young resident sustained serious injuries and is currently receiving medical attention. “In view of the above, the Commissioner of Police CP.
