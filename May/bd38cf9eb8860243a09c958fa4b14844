Former Imo Governor Rochas Okorocha has claimed he became poorer after ruling the state for eight years. He stated this during an interview on Channels Television monitored by The Nation. Okorocha, who represents the Imo West senatorial district, denied allegations he acquired properties with government funds. He explained he had always been a successful person before coming into office in 2011 and dared anyone to come forth with evidence that he mismanaged funds meant for the government. He said: “I challenge anybody to prove that I acquired any property with any government fund. “I think people have forgotten that I was Rochas before becoming the governor of Imo State; I think they have forgotten completely. “If anything, becoming a governor made me even poorer than what I was in the past. I don’t know whether I acquired any property here in Abuja, there is none.” He stated that during his two-term as Governor, he built the best international cargo airport and police command in the country as well as 27 hospitals, a new Government House, a new Court and a new prison complex, among others. Speaking on his encounter with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), he said: “I said to them (EFCC) that I have not come to respond to your call because there is already a matter in court and once a matter is sub judice, you cannot talk about it. “Imo State government has taken me to court on the same subject matter and we are at the Federal High Court in Abuja on the same subject matter. “EFCC is doing their job because if there is no report, they can’t nose into whatever you are doing; EFCC is not witch-hunting, they are acting on a petition being written by somebody.”
