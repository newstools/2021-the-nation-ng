The Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN) has reiterated its commitment to guide tax professionals and experts to sustainable professionalism, its President, Dame Gladys Simplice, has said. Speaking during the institute’s 43rd induction    in Lagos, she said one of the provisions of the CITN Charter is like a compass to members. The purpose of the institute, she said, is to maintain the sanctity of the profession to the extent that knowledgeable, skilled and qualified professionals are available. She explained that taxation remains unique   open to other professionals who have gone through its certification, to provide the basis for their being eligible to apply for the membership of the institute. “In cases where council had reviewed the requirements for admitting members by virtue of its powers as provided in Section 5 of the institute’s charter, it has always ensured that the values and intentions of the founding members of the Institute remain the bedrock of such decisions,” she said.
