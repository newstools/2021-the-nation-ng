 FUNMILOLA: My name is Funmilol, wife to the late Sgt. Ramonu. He died on February 26, 2004. He served at No. 2 Squadron Police Mobile Force, Keffi Street, Obalende Lagos. His Force was No 152028. His next-of-kin is Ismaila Omogboye, the  children Sakirat Omogboye, Ismaila Omogboye and Mohamed Omogboye and l. Since 2004, the only gratuity  paid to his family was N239,000 and N314,000 for pension. The children and I were told that the pension would be paid monthly to the children till they were 18, but nothing had been paid. I was told that we will be given N500,000 for insurance and that the children would be entitled to scholarship because their father died in active service. So far, nothing had been paid. Please assist us. Duke: I am writing to acknowledge N14,033.57 N50,133.67 for February and March, 2021. Please I want to know the reason PTAD has continued to deduct my money. Muritala:  I thank The Nation for being there for pensioners. I withdrew my service from National Youth Service Corps in 1996 after 12 years in service. I have been complaining since October 2020 on why did they removed my name from payroll since October? According to the Executive Secretary of PTAD, about 2,100 retirees were put on pension payroll. She had said she didn’t want the retirees to sweat before getting their entitlements. Yet, this is happening to me. I have no money to feed. Kindly solve my problem. Akinfewa:  Dear Omobola, this is my second reminder  on the pensioner’s verification with reference OYO/PF/Annonymous. My complaint is on non- harmonsation of my pension by PTAD. May I remind you that up till now, no results, despite that I have submitted my documents to PTAD. I am still alive by God’s grace. Florence: Hello Omobola, my name is Florence. My complaint is on PTAD’s deduction of my pension since December 2020. They reduced my pension from N8,000 to N3000 in what they called overpayment in the previous month. I told them to pay my gratuity that had been pending since May 2005 and then subtract the overpayment. But they carried on with the deductions. This is not fair. Please help me get PTAD to pay my gratuity to enable me benefit from my retirement from the Federal Service. They wanted my retirement papers for confirmation. I presented to them in October 2018. Kindly help me. Medu: My name is Medu. PTAD is owing me pension arrears of three months since 2015. I was verified in October 2019. They  promised to pay me after six months. It is over one year, they have refused to pay me. Folarin: I retired from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in April 2006. I was short paid my pension. During the verification on September 25, 2017 in Lagos, the case was noted but nothing had been done about it since then in spite of the letters I sent to PTAD’s the Executive Secretary. Kindly assist. Baiyegun: My name is Baiyegun and my complaint is on incorrect monthly pension. PTAD paid me N7,000 last  December instead of N15,000 that they have been paying me monthly. Please I want to know the reason for this short payment. Kareem:  My name is Kareem, a retiree under the old scheme. My monthly pension was stopped since December 2020 and efforts to restore it proved abortive. I have since submitted my bank statement of account and pension verification form to PTAD to peruse. Kindly help me out. Abraham: My name is Abraham, son and next-of-kin to  the late inspector Samuel Adem, from Benue State. My late father served the Nigerian Police and retired on June 29, 2004, after 26 years. Until his death, his monthly pension was yet commence. This means he was not on police pension payroll till he died on October 6, 2010. Please where how do start processing pension and other death benefits. Is it PTAD or PenCom?
