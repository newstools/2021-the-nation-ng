The Field Base basketball court recently hosted the 4th edition of the Sallah basketball jam that was chaired by Commodore Hamza Ibrahim. Six teams (Bulldogs, Hornets, Panthers, Apo Settlers Gilali Academy and Time Out Academy) took part in the 3×3 competition that was subsequently won by Time Out Academy. Four teams participated in the under-13 category of the 3×3 competition. Meanwhile, coaches Adeka Odaudu (Mark Mentors) and Abdul-Samad Usman led six other basketball coaches and seven P.E. Teachers in running the introduction to basketball clinic for children from the age of three years old. The children were taught basic basketball skills (ball bouncing, ball handling, passing, shooting, lay ups, defence and movement). Free copies of drug awareness brochures published by the Foundation for a Drug-Free World were distributed to the children, teenagers and adults that attended the event while some 50 basketball shoes that were provided by the Grab Foundation were freely distributed to the children and youths that attended this event. Some physically challenged children from the Rise Project (Niger State) also took part in the training sessions.
