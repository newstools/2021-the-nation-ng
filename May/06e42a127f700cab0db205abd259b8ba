Delta State Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa has adopted seven athletes to support their preparations towards the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Games. The adopted athletes include Favour Ofili, Blessing Okagbare, Divine Oduduru and Raymond Ekevwo. Others are Itshekiri Usheorise and Ogho Oghene Egwero and lately Ese Brume. With this adoption, the preparations of these athletes for the Olympics hit a higher gear. Personal expenses like medical, hiring of personal trainer, nutritionist and other related needs will be taken care of. The Adopt -an-Athlete initiative was created by the Minister of Youth and sports Development Sunday Dare to have individuals, state governments and corporate bodies to fund the training of Olympics- bound athletes. The money is too paid directly into the personal account of the adopted athletes after the signing of an MOU between the athlete and the adopter. These newly adopted athletes join the league of those that had earlier been adopted by Lagos, Edo and Ogun State Governors. Most of those adopted are already part of Team Nigeria camp in the United States.
