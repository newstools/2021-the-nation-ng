  Oyo State Governor Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde is expected to headline a virtual fundraiser for Dominican University Ibadan on Saturday. Makinde is expected to be joined by former Anambra State Government and Vice Presidential candidate in the last elections, Mr. Peter Obi; chairman of Seplat, Dr. A.B.C Orjiako; chairman of Airpeace, Allen Onyema, and Managing Director, Zinox Group, Mr. Leo Eke to raise funds for the institution’s faculty of social science building. Chairman of the event planning committee, Mrs. Emmanuella Otiono said funds generated from the exercise would be judiciously utilised for the construction of the Social Science building at the University’s permanent site, Omotosho Campus, in Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo State Mrs. Otiono said distinguished Nigerians with passion for good education had been invited to grace the event and “support the formation of a new generation of future leaders that will pass through the university.” She said the university grew out of Dominican Institute, which was affiliated to the University of Ibadan in 1993. The Dominican University was granted a provincial licence by Nigeria Universities Commission in November 2016 and began academic activities in October 2017. The university was granted a full statutory licence on June 10, 2020. The university is owned by the Order of Preachers (OP), popularly known as the Dominican Order or Dominicans, a religious order in the Catholic Church. The order was founded in 1216 by a Spanish priest, Dominic de Guzman. The Dominican University Ibadan, is its first university in Africa in its over 800 years of existence and involvement in tertiary education. Mrs Otiono said the university would graduate its pioneer students this year.
