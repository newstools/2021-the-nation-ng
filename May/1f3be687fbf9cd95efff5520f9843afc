 A community leader in Ogun State, Chief Toyin Amuzu, has expressed concern about the worsening security situation in the country. Amuzu lamented that a gunmen  murdered a popular hotelier and wife in Atan-Ota and the Gateway Polytechnic, Saapade, Ogun State was shut down over worsening insecurity. He said: “It is sad that 63-year-old Kehinde Ibidunni and his  wife, 54-year-old Elizabeth, were killed during an invasion of their residence at Atan-Ota, here in Ogun State. In fact, it is more worrisome that the authorities of the Gateway Polytechnic had to shut down the institution and asked the students to go home over worsening insecurity in the state as they could no more guarantee the safety of the students, while there have been  security issues in Ogun East, Ogun West and Ogun Central senatorial districts of the state.”  The community leader advised the government not to only create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, but to ensure that more job opportunities are created to positively engage our people. He added: “By now, we should have close circuit television (CCTV) in strategic places, proper profiling of people, sensitisation, community security and collaboration among other ideas to check the security challenge.” Amuzu stressed the need for Governor Dapo Abiodun not to forget his primary duty of catering for the security and the well-being of the people, which he swore to provide. He said while the police and other security agenciesmay be doing their best, it is left for the government to use its security vote wisely and empower the youth to reduce their involvement in crimes.
