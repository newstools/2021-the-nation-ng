Media personality and BBNaija ex-housemate, Ebuka Obi Uchendu will return as host of Big Brother Naija season six. Ebuka revealed that he will return as the reality TV show’s host for the fifth time on his verified social media pages on Monday, May 10. He shared a picture of himself looking dapper in a suit with the caption, “Well, guess who’s returning as the host of the next season of #BBNaija. Let’s go again, guys!!!” The revelation came a few weeks after a Twitter user suggested that Frank Edoho should replace Obi-Uchendu as the show host. The Twitter user had made a case for the established presenter, who hosted the popular TV game show, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, for 13 years. The tweet read, “Ebuka don eat small, make him allow another person chop! Frank Edoho as BBNaija host for this season won’t be a bad choice tho. Eviction night go choke gan!!!” The suggestion sparked a debate, which was finally laid to rest by Edoho via his official Twitter handle. He tweeted: “What did Ebuka do to deserve all this? Why would you want to change someone that has done a show successfully for only three years and have him replaced with one who did WWTBAM for 13 years? Leave Ebuka alone! Please.” Big Brother Naija, formerly known as Big Brother Nigeria, is a reality television series franchise owned by Endemol. The show began to air in Nigeria on March 5, 2006 and its first presenters were Olisa Adibua and Michelle Dede. After the first edition, the show was put on hold till January 22, 2017, when it resurfaced for a rebranding and second edition. Obi-Uchendu, who was a contestant in the maiden edition, became the host of the show and has hosted the show for five straight years. The popular reality TV show has topped previous seasons as its organisers, MultiChoice, announced a grand prize of N90m for the current season.
