As Paris Saint-Germain await a response from Kylian Mbappe on whether to accept the club’s offer to extend his deal beyond 2022 or leave the Ligue 1 giants this summer, sporting director Leonardo has a list of potential replacements that includes Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah, according to ESPN. Salah, 28, has two years left on his contract and has 21 goals and four assists in 33 Premier League matches this season. Salah, who was signed for an initial €42 million from Roma in the summer of 2017 and has improved under manager Jurgen Klopp, recently said the club have not approached him for a new deal.  However, Klopp has also said previously that he did not want any of his front three (Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino) to leave in the summer. Although it is widely known that new PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino is a fan of Salah, it is unlikely that the Reds will consider anything less than €80m for him.
