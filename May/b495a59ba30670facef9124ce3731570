 Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare has charged the newly inaugurated caretaker committees of the 30 sports federation to be focused in the best interest of the nation. During the inauguration of the caretaker committees in Abuja yesterday, Dare  said he would not hesitate to remove any caretaker committee member  that works at cross purposes with the aspirations of the federations. He said:  “The dissolution became necessary because of the expiration of your tenures. It is also important because of the Tokyo Olympics which is less than 90 days away. “This requires that all hands are on deck because continuity is necessary to ensure preparations for the Games are not hampered in any way. “The caretaker committees were thus specially selected to reflect our aspirations towards podium appearances at the Tokyo Olympics.”  In  a related development, the  Rugby Africa has suspended Nigeria from all its activities with immediate effect following the dissolution of the board of the Nigeria Rugby Football Federation (NRFF). The continental ruling body in a letter addressed to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare and signed by its President Khaled Babbou, described the dissolution as against the stipulations of the approved Constitution of the Nigeria Rugby Football Federation (NRFF). “The dissolution of the duly elected board of NRFF is against the stipulations of the approved Constitution and is highly disruptive for the unions’ operations. Consequently, we have no choice but to impose an immediate suspension of Nigeria’s participation in all Rugby Afrique and World Rugby activities until further notice. We do appeal in all sincerity that the Ministry allows the Federation to follow its approved constitution,” Babbou said.
