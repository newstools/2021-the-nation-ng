The Emir of Zauzzau, Alhaji Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli has commended the Athletics Federation of Nigeria AFN for bringing the Confederation of African Athletics Region II Championship to Zaria, Kaduna State. The Sarkin Zauzzau made this known when he flagged off the 21km half marathon race to herald the two-day regional event holding at the Ahmadu Bello Sports Complex. The Emir thanked the AFN President Ibrahim Shehu Gusau for his contributions to sports development in the country especially in Zaria, where the youths are taking to sports as a means of livelihood and recreation. “I believe that this competition in Zaria is the beginning of more events to come to this city. This will attract more sports tourism to Zaria if it becomes a consistent thing in Zaria” In his response, the AFN President Ibrahim Gusau described Zaria as an ancient city with Ahmadu Bello University participating actively in sports in the early seventies and eighties before fizzling out.
