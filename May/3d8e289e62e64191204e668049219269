ZINEDINE Zidane hinted on Saturday he could leave as coach of Real Madrid at the end of the season, saying he believes “there comes a time when it’s the moment to change”. Zidane’s contract expires in 2022 but he has repeatedly refused to confirm he will still be at the club next season. The Frenchman has a history of surprises after resigning as coach unexpectedly in 2018 before making a shock return a year later. As a player, he initially announced his retirement from international football in 2004 before coming back for the 2006 World Cup, after which he retired for good. “You talk about me leaving in 2006 and 2018 and it’s like you think I leave because I’m shirking responsibility or that I quit when things get tough,” said Zidane in a press conference. “It’s not, the only thing about me is that what I do, I do to the end, and then there comes a time when it’s the moment to change. For everyone, not just for me. For the club, for the good of the club, for the people.
