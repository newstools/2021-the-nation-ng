Bayelsa State Police Command says its operatives have smashed a three-man armed robbery gang in Yenagoa, the state capital, and arrested the gang leader, identified as Gift Joshua. The commandâ€™s spokesman Asinim Butswat said on Thursday that the operatives of the State Investigation and Intelligence Bureau (SIIB) on routine surveillance encountered the armed robbery gang and engaged them in a shoot-out resulting in the arrest of the gang leader. Butswat said the incident happened at about 9.30am on Wednesday at Erepa area of the state capital. The spokesman, a Superintendent of Police, said the suspected armed robbery gang went to a Point of Sale (POS) shop at Erepa on the pretext of making withdrawals, but suddenly pointed a gun and robbed the owner of N90, 000 and his phone. Butswat said the victim courageously confronted the suspected armed robbers and raised the alarm which drew the attention of the police operatives on surveillance and members of the community. He said the police and community members pursued the suspects and arrested the gang leader, Gift Joshua. He, however, said that angry mob lynched one Douglas, surname unknown, while the other gang member, one Keme Azorbo, escaped with gunshot wounds. Butswat said detectives were on the trail of the suspect who escaped and that investigation was ongoing.
