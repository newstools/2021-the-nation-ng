 UFC Welterweight Champion, Kamaru Usman, earlier in the week leaked Burna Boy’s  latest single, Kilometre. In a video shared by Burna on his Instagram page, the 33-year-old martial artist was seen dancing and singing to the new tune in a car. “I no say my brother Burna go vex small. But I must leak this new song, I go give una small,” the Nigerian-American professional fighter said.  Reacting to the skit, the Grammy award-winning singer applauded ‘The Nigerian Nightmare’. “My brother aka THE CHAMP @usman84kg out here leaking my shit! New single out Thursday.” This is coming a month after the singer won the coveted Grammy award for his last album, ‘Twice as Tall.’
