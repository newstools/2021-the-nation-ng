 NOLLYWOOD actor Enyinna Nwigwe is fast becoming the most sought after for tough biopics following his audacious attempt at mirroring the life of retired General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida. For his role in the biopic directed by Obi Emelonye, Nwigwe displayed a wealth of experience on the job without being inflexible. Despite the previous roles -The Wedding Party 2, Cold Feet, Living in Bondage sequel – Nwigwe was able to balance his rising popularity without usurping his character as ‘Bademosi’s’ protagonist. The actor has been getting positive reviews for his ability to pull off the eponymous role as the protagonist in ‘Badamasi’ while remaining malleable and sharing some physical attributes with the main subject. Ahead of the film’s premiere scheduled for June 12, 2021, at Cineworld – The O2, London, Nwigwe scooped his first AMA Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination in 2020.  ‘Badamasi: Portrait of a General’ sees Nwigwe playing the role of a powerful Army General who attempts to guide Nigeria through a viciously strained era in this first-of-its-kind authorised biopic. Born in a small village in Northern Nigeria called Wushishi, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, or IBB as he is fondly called loses both of his parents by the age of 14. It is his charm and intelligence that would propel him from that inauspicious beginning to the pinnacle of military politics in Africa’s most populous country. But to fulfill his destiny, Babangida has to survive a brutal civil war, spearhead several successful military coups, escape a few ferocious plots on his own life, and confront his deepest fears. But when fate pitches the General against the will of 150 million tough Nigerians, something has to give. Babangida has won several battles to rule Nigeria for 8 years. However, with the country about to implode, he may have to lose the fight to bring her back from the brink.
