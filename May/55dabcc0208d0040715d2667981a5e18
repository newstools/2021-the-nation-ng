Naira Marley has reacted to backlash after reiterating his desire to have carnal knowledge of mother and daughter someday. The singer, who is known for making uncensored and vile comments on social media, disclosed some of his incredulous sexual fantasies on Thursday. Although the post has since been deleted by the “Soapy” crooner”, it has continued to gather mixed reactions from celebrities, parents, fans and the generality of the Nigerian populace. However, reacting to the increasing backlash the ‘Marlian’ President queried those quick to judge him. He noted he had rights to whatever sexual act and with any number of persons as long as it is based on the consent of all the parties involved. He further stated for the fear of God and not wanting to go to hell, he would have done unfathomable things. The Marlian Records Label boss tweeted: “They tell you to be yourself but when you’re yourself they’re quick to judge you. “Maybe my thoughts are wild but if no be say I fear God and I don’t want to go hell ‘I for Don do and undo’. “I have the right to threesome, as long as it is consensual and legal.”
