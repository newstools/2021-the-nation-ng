Onuachu is special, incomparable – Former Belgian coach talks up Super Eagles star’s Premier League. Former Belgium national team coach René Vandereycken has revealed his admiration for Nigerian striker Paul Onuachu, who has kept tongues singing his praises following an astonishing goal-scoring campaign for Racing Genk. Onuachu has racked up an incredible 31 goals and three assists in 35 league matches for Genk to power the Smurfs to a top-four finish. The ex-Midtjylland man equally found the back of the net twice in three games to help Racing triumph in the Belgian Cup. With a scoring record that places him among the best strikers in Europe, Onuachu attracts interest from Italy, France, and Scotland. Vandereycken is convinced that Onuachu is ready to step up from the Belgian championship to the German Bundesliga or even the English Premier League. Talking up the physical attributes and footballing intelligence of Onuachu, the former Genk manager expects the Super Eagles man to cope well with moving to a more demanding league. “Onuachu is a very special type of striker; you can hardly compare him with anyone,” Vandereycken told Het Nieuwsblad via VoetbalPrimeur. “Despite his 2.01 meters, Onuachu is technically strong and fast. And he often succeeds in making the right decision has to do.”
