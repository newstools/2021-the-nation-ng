Ekiti State Government and Promasidor Nigeria has taken delivery of 250 pregnant heifers from the United States of America. In a statement obtained by our correspondent, the management informed that this is the second batch of heifers arriving the farm after the first arrival on February 10th this year. It is in line with the objectives of the state government and Promasidor to make the dairy farm a model of backward integration on a commercial scale. Upon calving, the milk production on the farm will definitely be boosted by the Jersey heifersâ€™ arrival as they are expected to produce an average of 20 litres of milk per day per animal. In a bid to bring the efforts of Promasidor on the farm to fruition, the Ekiti State Government has ensured all issues with landowners were resolved and full access to land granted for use. They also ensured the connection of the farm to the national grid for regular power supply.
