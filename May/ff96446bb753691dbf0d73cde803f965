Kogi Governor Yahaya Bello on Tuesday boasted the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has performed beyond the 16-year achievement of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He stressed his party has delivered good governance to Nigerians. Bello spoke on Tuesday during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily monitored by The Nation. He said: “Largely, APC has performed beyond what PDP has achieved in their 16 years of governance in Nigeria “APC’s successes today within six years outweigh the successes of 16 years that they ruled. The statistics are there. We will remind Nigerians of where APC inherited Nigeria and where we are today.” While speaking on the worrisome trend of insecurity in the country, he called on all Nigerians to collaborate in tackling the issue rather than politicising the challenges. Bello stated that banditry had been an issue in Nigeria even before the emergence of the current administration, stressing that APC is doing its best to end banditry.
