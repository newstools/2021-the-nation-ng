  Over 2000 women yesterday staged a solidarity march on the streets of Uyo in protest against the gruesome killing of an Akwa Ibom job seeker  Iniubong Umoren. The women were heard singing dirges and chanting, “We want justice for Iniubong”, “justice for one is justice for all,” “no more rape, no more gender violence.” They marched from Ibom Connection in the centre of Uyo metropolis down to Nwaniba and moved to Wellington Bassey Way leading to Government House. The solidarity walk was led by the State Commissioner for Women and Social Welfare, Dr Ini Adiakpan, Deputy Speaker of the State Assembly, Mrs Felicia Bassey, and the State Chairman of International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Emem Etteh, among others.  Addressing the crowd, wife of the governor, Dr Martha Emmanuel assured them of justice for Umoren. “I am pained about the brutal murder of our daughter, Iniubong Umoren and all others. We have done everything we could to stop the menace of harassing our children, mothers and sisters, but it seems we are doing nothing. “For this singular act, we are saying enough is enough. Iniubong has paid the final price; this will not happen again and I want to tell you that this monster and all the accomplices will not go unpunished. Dr. Adiakpan lamented the increase in sexual attack cases. FIDA chair Ette said the organisation would  continue to defend women, noting that a lot has to be done to re-orientate the male counterparts on their  duties and roles as defenders of women.
