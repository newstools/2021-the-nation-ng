Family of Adegboyegun Ademola popularly known as Saina has appealed to Ondo Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to help secure release of his corpse for proper burial. Saina was killed in March during the violence that rocked the Ondo chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). The family spoke in a report addressed to Akeredolu by the Fighters for Human Rights Service, an independent group that investigated circumstances leading to the death of Ademola. In the report, the leadership of the Ondo NURTW was asked to refund N700, 000 to Ademola’s family to cover incidental expenses borne by the deceased family, including mortuary bills from March 9th to May 12th, 2021. The report also asked the NURTW to provide for educational expenses for the deceased children, business empowerment of his two widows and purchase of land where he would be buried. Other demands were for the NURTW to provide financial upkeep for late Ademola’s aged mother as well as buy the casket and other materials for his burial. Director of Legal Services of the group, Barr Henry Orumen, said the group waded into the matter following a petition by family of the deceased. Orumen explained that all parties, including State Chairman of NURTW Comrade Jacob Adebo Barr (Otunba) and Olorunmaye fingered as Ademola’s suspected killers were invited. Orumen said Adebo and Olorunmaye denied the allegations and all persons interviewed claimed not seeing the assailants. He said N7m was expended to investigate the death of Ademola. Besides begging Governor Akeredolu to help secure release of Ademola corpse, Orumen requested for the lifting of the suspension of NURTW activities in the state. Akeredolu had banned Ondo NURTW from motor-parks as well as barring them from collecting any dues from drivers on the highway or motor-parks. Akeredolu’s action followed days of violent attacks among warring factions of NURTW.
