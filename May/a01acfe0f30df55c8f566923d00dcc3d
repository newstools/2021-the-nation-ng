 Jigawa State Police Commissioner, Usman Gonna, yesterday said the command arrested 35 persons who allegedly defiled minors between January and March. He stated this while making a presentation at an expanded State Security meeting chaired by Governor Badaru Abubakar. According to the police boss, rape cases topped the list of criminal activities recorded in the state in the first quarter of the year. Noting that some of the survivors were as young as three years, Gonna urged parents to be vigilant and protect their children from paedophiles. He said: “Contrary to today’s assumption that kidnappings and banditry are on the increase, it is not so in Jigawa as we have only recorded 10 kidnappings within the last four months.”  Gonna said rape and other criminal activities such as culpable homicide and sodomy have taken the front burner across the state. The Police Commissioner said that the judicial workers strike has led to congestion of suspects in police cells. “I have complained to the state Commissioner of Justice to intervene in how to decongest the cells and he assured me that soon judges will be assigned to dispense justice to some of the criminals kept in the cells,” he said. The law prescribes death for rapists and kidnappers. This law, according to the Commissioner for Justice, Musa Aliyu, also provides for compensation for survivors of rape. “If the rapist infected the victim with HIV the Judge has no option but to pass the death sentence particularly if the accused person has knowledge of his HIV status. “The law also stipulates 16 years as age of consent, while any illegal sexual intercourse through the vagina, anus or mouth of either a boy or girl falls in the category of rape and the offender would be treated as such in accordance with the law,” he said.
