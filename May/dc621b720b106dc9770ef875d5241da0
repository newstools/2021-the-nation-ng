The ruling Peoplesâ€™ Democratic Party (PDP) has won 32 out of the 33 local government areas in Oyo State. Chairman, Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC), Mr Isiaka Olagunju, made the declaration after the presentation of results by returning officers for the local government areas at the headquarters of the Commission, Agodi, Ibadan, on Sunday. The election, which held on Saturday, witnessed a low turnout of voters, violence and disruption in some parts of the state while the no- movement restriction order was largely disobeyed by residents. The results announced by Olagunju indicated the PDP won in: Itesiwaju, Iseyin, Kajola, Iwajowa, Atisbo, Saki East, Saki West, Oorelope, Irepo and Olorunsogo local government areas. Others are: Ogbomoso North, Ogbomosho South, Ogo-Oluwa, Oriire, Surulere, Ibarapa Central, Ibarapa North, Afijio, Atiba, Oyo West and Oyo East. The party also won in: Ibadan North East, Akinyele, Oluyole, Lagelu, Ibadan North West, Egbeda, Ibadan South West, Ona Ara, Ibadan North, Ibadan South East and Ibarapa East areas. Barring any last-minute change, the elected chairmen will be sworn in on Monday by Governor Seyi Makinde. Election for the Iddo LG was suspended as a result of the omission of the logo of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) on the ballot paper on Saturday. The election has been slated for Wednesday, May 26, making it the third time it would be changed in two days. According to the state electoral umpire, 17 parties participated in the election by their party logo reflecting on the ballot papers. But the All Progressive Congress (APC) denied participating in the polls, claiming its request for an extension of time by OYSIEC, owing to a recent Supreme Court victory of the sacked council bosses, was rebuffed by the Commission. Some of the areas with cases of violence, gunshots, ballot snatching during the polls were: Oke-Ola, Eruwa in Ibarapa East, Ogbomosho North, Ogbomosho South and Orire LGs.
