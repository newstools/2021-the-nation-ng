The Senator representing Kaduna Central, Uba Sani has called for prayers for students of Greenfield University and other victims still in the hands of kidnappers, terrorists and bandits, saying his heart bleeds for them. In a special Sallah message by the lawmaker, he expressed deep concern over the horrible situation of the abducted students of Greenfield University in Kaduna, Leah Sharibu and Chibok girls amongst other children under terrorists’ captivity. According to the Senator, “As we celebrate, let us spare a moment for our children who are still held captive by kidnappers, terrorists and bandits. My heart bleeds for the abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, Leah Sharibu, the Chibok Girls and other children held captive across the country,” the lawmaker said. He described the psychological torture the captives go through as “simply unimaginable”, while enjoining the kidnappers to “use the special occasion of Eid-el-Fitr to have a rethink and release the traumatized students and other abductees.” Senator Uba, who is also the Chairman Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and other Financial Institutions, tasked the nation’s elites to put heads together in developing a framework for lowering tension in the country. “If our country goes down, we shall all be casualties,” he warned
