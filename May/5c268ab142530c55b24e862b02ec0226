The Onikotun of Ikotun, Oba Azeez Gbadabiu Asiwaju has made an appeal to the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to render financial support towards the early completion of the new kingâ€™s palace. The monarch made the appeal during the foundation laying ceremony of the palace building in Ikotun, as part of the activities marking his 20th year Coronation Anniversary. Oba Gbadabiu stated that the rationale behind the construction of the new palace is to accord the necessary royal status to traditional institution in the state and also make the palace a tourist centre. This is explained will be a source of pride to all the good people of Ikotun and Lagos State in general. The Oba, while acknowledging the support rendered by individuals, various groups and organisations in the past five years towards the construction of the palace, added that the journey is still far as regards early completion of the project.
