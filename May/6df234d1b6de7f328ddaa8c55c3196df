The Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, has put the commissioners of police in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Plateau State on the alert over imminent attacks by Boko Haram members. The alert was contained in a May 19, 2021 circular addressed to the two commissioners of police and signed by the Principal Staff Officer to the IGP, Idowu Owohunwa, an acting CP. He said intelligence report revealed that terrorists are planning to attack Abuja and Jos. The circular with reference number TB: 0900/IGP.SEC/ABJ/VOL.TI/47 was titled ‘Terror elements to expand frontiers of attack.’ A copy of the circular was obtained by The Nation on Friday.  In the circular, Baba directed the commissioners of police to review their security architecture and beef up security around government facilities particularly in Abuja and Jos. The circular reads in part: “Intelligence report at the disposal of the Inspector-General of Police has uncovered plans by Boko Haram terrorists to attack major cities in the country, particularly in Jos, Plateau and the FCT, Abuja. “The proposed attacks would be coordinated by the duo of Muhammad Sani, a Boko Haram commander, domiciled in Sambisa Forest and his deputy, Suleiman, hibernating around Lawan Musa Zango, Gashua, Yobe State. “In light of the above, it is the directive of the Inspector-General of Police that you review your security architecture across all critical government infrastructures and police facilities in your jurisdiction with a view to checkmating the dastardly plans of these marauding terrorists.”
