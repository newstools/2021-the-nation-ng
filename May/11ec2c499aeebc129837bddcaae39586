Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that some of the gunmen responsible for the ambushes and murders of security personnel in the state have been arrested and will face the full wrath of the law. Wike in a state broadcast on Saturday evening said the state government had undertaken measures to check the recent attacks on security checkpoints and the killing of some security personnel and it’s yielding positive result. He said: “Thank heavens, those responsible for the premeditated ambushes and murders of security personnel in the State have been apprehended and are now facing the bitter venom of our laws as none that is proven to be criminally liable will escape the fury and crushing impact of justice. “We wish to reassure every citizen and resident that we are able, willing and ready to act directly and decisively, and at any time, with the full weight of our government to forestall every security threat to our State from any person, group or quarters.”
