Neymar pledged to help Paris Saint-Germain finally win the ever-elusive Champions League trophy after signing a three-year contract extension on Saturday, keeping the Brazil star at the ambitious club until 2025. PSG posted a video of Neymar wearing a jersey with 2025 on the back and saying “Ici c’est Paris” — ‘This is Paris’, a favorite chant of the fans. What they and the club demand is the Champions League, a trophy PSG has never won despite spending a world record 222 million euros ($270 million) on Neymar when he joined from Barcelona four years ago. “Of course, my goal when I came was to help get Paris Saint-Germain to the top, among the very best, and we are getting close,” Neymar said. “We are gaining more and more experience to help us negotiate these types of games.”
