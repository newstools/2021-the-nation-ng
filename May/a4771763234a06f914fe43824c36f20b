The National Orientation Agency (NOA) in Adamawa has urged top government officials and traditional leaders to understand the importance of Freedom of Information (FOI) Act for the country to move forward. Malam Muhammad Gabdo, NOA Acting Director in Adamawa, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Yola. He said that FOI was one of the good Federal Government policies that if fully followed, would move the country forward. “If we apply it, we are going to get a lot especially in transparency and accountability in our offices as well as stewardship in government. “We can also reduce the rate of crime we are facing in the country, why? Because; most of these crimes are from fake news and rumor mongering on social media. “If and only all of us embrace the FOI Act, it will enable people to have access to credible information, be it government or NGOs for us to succeed and be peaceful,’’ he said. According to him, the agency is presently on advocacy tour to top government officials and traditional leaders before reaching out to general public, as many people are not aware of the existence of the Act. Gabdo called on government officials to understand the aim of the Act and advised those who intend to get any information to follow due process. “It is clear in the Act that anybody requesting for any information from any MDAs, it should be given to him within seven days, “Or else he should be given written reasons why he will not get it and he has every right to go to court and ask for it because it is now a law,” he explained.
