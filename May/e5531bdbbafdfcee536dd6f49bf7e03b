 After grilling him for hours over alleged diversion of N9 billion, operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday detained former Kwara State Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed. Sources within the anti-graft agency confirmed that the former governor was not allowed to go home after facing a crack team of interrogators at the EFCC headquarters in Jabi, Abuja. Ahmed was said to have arrived at the EFCC office at about 10am yesterday to honour the agency’s invitation. One of the sources said: “And for the past seven hours, he has been in the interrogation room, writing statements. “Though details of the case are still sketchy as of press time, I think it is connected to how funds to the tune of about N9 billion was diverted from the coffers of Kwara State Government during his tenure as governor of Kwara State between 2011 and 2019.”  The source said the former governor will be made to account for his tenure as Finance Commissioner under the administration of former Senate President, who handed over to Ahmed as governor. Head of Media and Publicity at the EFCC, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed that the former governor responded to the commission’s invitation. He declined to give further details. It was the second time Ahmed will be interrogated by the EFCC following his earlier invitation on December 8, 2020 by the Ilorin Zonal office of EFCC. But the Finance Commissioner under Ahmed, Ademola Banu had been arraigned for alleged N411 million money laundering
