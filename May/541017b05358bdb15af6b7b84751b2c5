To improve school governance and administration in public schools, the Lagos State Government has introduced a Volunteer Mentorship Programme for public school teachers and administrators. Retired and experienced school principals, teachers and administrators will be engaged to serve as mentors and will coach existing school personnel across the state. Disclosing this during an interview at her office, the Education Commissioner, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, said the initiative was in line with Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu’s Education Transformation Plan aimed at improving the capacity of school personnel. She added that the programme would create opportunities for education stakeholders to support the government in mentoring teachers/ school administrators.  “This programme will enhance the productivity of our teachers and principals with consequential improvement in the performances of pupils and students in the State,” she said. Mrs. Adefisayo said the mentorship programme was open to retired permanent secretaries, directors, principals and teachers of private and public institutions who through years of experience in the education sector can collaborate with the state to improve the education system. She said the selected mentors would engage their mentees on contemporary teaching methods, leverage on feedback for improved performance and work with the school principals for effective and efficient management in their schools. The commissioner urged interested professionals to apply online through the “Teachers Mentoring Corp Project” on the Lagos State Volunteer Corp website www.lsvc.ng or through a link on the State Government’s Portal www.lagosstate.gov.ng and social media handles of the Ministry @lasgeducation. She said the selected mentors would be briefed and provided with handbooks for the assignment.
