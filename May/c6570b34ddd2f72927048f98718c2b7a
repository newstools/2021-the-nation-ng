CRISTIANO Ronaldo remains very much a Juventus player, coach Andrea Pirlo insisted on Saturday, with the Portuguese star’s future in doubt going into the final game of the season. Juve’s Champions League hopes are no longer in their hands as they head for 11th-placed Bologna needing a win and hoping rivals Napoli and AC Milan slip up. However, Pirlo does not believe that the game will be Ronaldo’s final one with the club if they fail to qualify for elite European football. “No, I see him still in the ‘Bianconero’ jersey and focused,” Pirlo told a pre-match press conference. “He proved it the other night, sacrificing himself because he wanted to win the Coppa Italia. “I see him focused on tomorrow, then there’s time to discuss the rest.”
