 Unity Bank Plc has  kicked off Season 2 of its pioneer educational gameplay, the One Minute Genius (OMG). The OMG 2.0 game play, which kicked off in May 3, on the Unity Bank’s website is an expanded virtual version of the maiden edition. Over 200 winners will emerge at the end of the 25-day contest. To win prizes in any of categories, participating students can play the virtual game from Monday to Friday between 8 AM – 6 PM. The OMG is an initiative that underscores Unity Bank’s commitment to the development of the next generation, as it seeks to connect with their aspirations and reinforce the importance of education as a vehicle to empower the Nigerian child. Children and students between six and  17 years can participate in the game. According to the Divisional Head, Retail/SME & E-business, Unity Bank Plc, Olufunwa Akinmade, the idea is to enable the participants improve their intelligence quotient and unleash the genius in them. Olufunwa explained that the game will be played as a blend of quizzes containing spelling bee and Arithmetic questions. “The children that answer the questions correctly within the one-minute stipulated timeframe will be rewarded with cash prizes”, he quips. Shedding more light on the initiative, Olufunwa said: “the bank has decided to continue investing in the game play because it is pleased with the impact which the previous editions of the contest had created being a vehicle for reinvigorating the values of education through gamification and fun.” Olufunwa added: “Unity Bank remains committed to playing a critical role in advancing learning for a better society by developing the minds of our children. And this virtual, participatory learning and reward contest has proved quite effective in achieving the goals of motivating the students towards subject mastery using a branch of reinforcement model.”
