A pressure group, Buhari Support Group (BSG), said it has uncovered plots by some opposition members of raising militia groups to unleash terrors in some volatile Southern States. The group claimed to be in possession of a list of some Governors, political influencers, youth organisations and clandestine organisations behind the planned attacks. Its National Secretary, Hon. Nonso Ezedinma, under the #istandwithbuhari who disclosed this to newsmen in Abuja said the group has forwarded their names to security agencies. Ezedinma said the group also has classified information on plans by the opposition to politicise the security situation in the country in order to score cheap political goals. The group then gave the sponsors of the militia groups till end of the month to disband or face mass action. Ezedinma noted despite efforts by the President Buhari led administration to squarely address the situation, some opposition elements “do not mind sponsoring deaths of thousand of their fellow citizens, kidnapping young kids and even raping and murdering them, while sabotaging efforts by our armed forces, so they can politicize issues on insecurity to create chaos and possibly bring down the government and push Nigeria into an ethnic war.” The group added: “Some disgraceful opportunists and vengeful individuals who had been exposed, disgraced and in some cases convicted of looting public funds, who see Nigeria’s treasury as their feeding bottle which had been taken away from their lips since 2015, are now applying all the resources they accumulated during their 16 years reign of zero-accountability to fight dirty, sensing that if President Buhari is allowed to succeed in clearing up all their mess and setting us back on the right course, they will not be able to have any role again to play in the new Nigeria.”
