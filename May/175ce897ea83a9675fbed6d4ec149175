Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has suspended his Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on Special Duties, Abidemi Rufai, following his arrest in New York by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over his alleged involvement in $350 million unemployment benefits fraud. The United States Department of Justice had announced Rufai’s arrest on Monday. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, Abiodun said the news of his aide’s involvement in fraud was disturbing. The statement said: “This morning, we received the disturbing news of the arrest of one of the governor’s political appointees, Mr. Abidemi Rufai, in New York over alleged unemployment benefits and fraud in the United States. “While the governor cannot be held responsible for the actions of a full-grown adult, especially outside the jurisdiction of Ogun State and Nigeria, he has since suspended the suspect to enable him answer the charges levelled against him. “The governor wishes to condemn any act capable of undermining his determination to institute an open, transparent, accountable and morally upright behaviour in the state and governance. “Governor Abiodun remains committed to his agenda of building our future together and will not condone criminals either in his government or the state in general.”
