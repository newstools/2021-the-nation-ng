 Suspected herdsmen have shot and killed four persons in an  attack on Yelwata community in Guma council area of Benue State. The Nation gathered that the four persons in their teens  were working on their farm on Saturday when the herdsmen attacked them. The unprovoked killings  angered the youths in the area who blocked the Makurdi-Lafia Highway with the bodies of the four teenagers.  Attempt  by the military, police and other security agencies to get the youths off the road were rebuffed, causing traffic gridlock on the highway. Chairman of Guma Local Government Caleb Abah said, “As we speak, calm has been restored to the area and we are already making arrangements for the dead to be buried,” the council boss said. He acknowledged the efforts of Governor Samuel Ortom who quickly mobilised some government functionaries to the troubled area to calm frayed nerves which resulted in the quick resolution of the matter. Police spokesperson Catherine Anene did return calls to her phone.
