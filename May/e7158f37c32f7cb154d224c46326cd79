 Ten students of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, in Anambra State have benefited from a one-year scholarship from the Chairman, GSS Group of Companies, Chukwudi Ezenwa. Presenting the award to the deserving students in Awka, Ezenwa, an architect, described education as the bedrock of development of any society seeking change. He decried high rate of poverty in society which he said had constituted hindrances to students’ access to quality and tertiary education. “I  feel pained whenever I see people who are bright and should attain tertiary education but unable to  because of paucity of funds. That’s why I go out of my way to help as many as I can whenever I see opportunity,” he said. Congratulating the beneficiaries on the award, the benefactor charged them to be of good behaviour and take their studies seriously. “While in school, acquire basic skills, sharpen your USP, and look for side hustles that would help sustain your journey in the university,” he said. Ezenwa, an alumnus, selected the students following an interactive session with them at the induction of the Faculty of Environmental Sciences. He assured them of his continued support and urged other alumni to support indigent and bright students achieve their goals. President, Faculty of Environmental Sciences Students Association (FESSA), Victor Okeke, thanked the benefactor for the gesture, describing him as a role model to many young people. He urged the awardees to justify the scholarship by studying hard. One of the beneficiaries, Miss Esther Ndubisi, showered encomiums on Ezenwa, describing him as God sent.   “I deeply appreciate Chukwudi Ezenwa for this uncommon generosity. God will continue to bless him. Yes, problems do not end but God will handle any problem or challenging issues in the company. “It is my prayer that long life and strength will be his portion. We’re grateful to him for not just awarding us with scholarship but also taking time to open our eyes about real estate,” she said.
