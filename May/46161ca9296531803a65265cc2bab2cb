Bauchi Governor Bala Mohammed has said the Federal Government has lost ideas on how to address the various economic challenge bedeviling the nation. Mohammed, who spoke on Thursday at the Government House shortly after performing the Eid prayers to mark the Sallah celebration, said the FG should stop the blame game and look for a way forward. According to him: “I think the FG has lost any idea to grow the economy. What they are best known for is the blame game. They are not even fighting the corruption they claimed to be fighting ” Mohammed, who blamed the nation’s backwardness on nepotism by the Buhari led-administration, added there is no fairness and equitable allocation of appointments across the six geopolitical zones. He said: ”There are sacred cows and small gods who cannot be touched in Buhari’s government but if you are not fair and equitable in your government, If there is nepotism where only one section is giving positions in your government, then there will be problems. ” There is an iota of truth in what the Southern Governors said on some sections being highly favoured at the detriment of others. ” What we know in this country as a Federalist is that there should always be a balance. If you don’t practice fairness at the top , then you cannot get it at the lower level. Unless we show fairness and equity we cannot grow the economy .”
