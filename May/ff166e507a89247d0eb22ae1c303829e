The Anglican Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Niger, the Most Rev Alexander Ibezim, has advised members to prioritise the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State. He said the poll was critical to the future of the state, adding that it should not be treated with levity. Speaking at the weekend during the 2nd Season of the 12th Synod of the diocese with the theme: “Expanding our ministerial coast: Implication for the ordained and the laity”, Ibezim encouraged members to get their voter cards ready to vote for credible leaders. He said: ”According to the Independent National Electoral Commission timetable, the Anambra governorship election will be held on November 6. “We encourage you to get your permanent voter cards and ensure you vote wisely. Your vote is your voice, make this voting a priority. We trust the Lord to give us His choice as the governor of Anambra State.” The archbishop, who is also the bishop of Awka Diocese, hailed Governor Willie Obiano for building an international cargo/passenger airport in the state, as well as prompt payment of workers’ salaries. He, however, urged him to ensure the completion of the reconstruction of deplorable roads in the state as well as enhancement of security architecture to guarantee a peaceful environment. On the growing insecurity across the country, Ibezim pleaded with the governments to address the restructuring agitations across the country. “Without security of lives and property in the country, no development can take place. Business and academic activities thrive and take place in secure environment. “The church is duty bound to continue to pray for the nation, but we plead with the current government at the state and federal levels to listen to the agitations of restructuring all over the country,” he added. The event, held at St. Michael and All Angels Church, Nawfia, was attended by over 40 bishops and other dignitaries.
