Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State is no doubt a beautiful bride sought many, especially within the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Sources close to him says the governor intends to make use of the current attention he is enjoying to better the lot of the party in his state. In the last few weeks, amidst rumours that he had concluded plans to dump PDP and join the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), leaders and stakeholders of the opposition party have been showering attention on Ayade to dissuade him from defecting. During the week, Ayade played host to the leadership of the PDP Governors’ Forum in Calabar. Reports claim the governors were in town to ‘rub minds on some issues bothering on party unity. Sentry, however, gathered that the parley was another opportunity for PDP leaders to appeal to Ayade not to jump ship. A couple of weeks before then, some party leaders were in the state to ‘visit’ the governor. Feelers were that the visit was to beg Ayade to shelve any plan of joining APC. Reliable sources say the governor is telling PDP leaders and colleague governors the same thing: he wants all forms of external interference in the running of the party in his state to stop, if he is to hearken to the plenty pleas.
