A final year student of the Delta State University (DELSU) Abraka and a yet-to-be identified commercial motorcyclist have been crushed to death by a cement-laden truck. It was learnt the incident occurred on Tuesday as the truck tried to avoid a motorcyclist and another vehicle plying the ever-busy Police station road in Abraka. It was said to have skidded off the road, falling on the side where it crushed the victims. Unconfirmed reports say a woman who was on board the motorcycle was also involved in the accident. The student was reportedly a First Class student of the Department of Economics. “How can this happen? Today is supposed to be his mother’s birthday. Who will disclose this bad news to his mother now,” one Matthew, said to be a friend of the deceased, cried. A video of the scene saw Maduka’s body partly trapped under the trailer, and a man lying on a side of the road while sympathisers made frantic efforts to rescue any other victim by unloading the cement truck. It was further learnt the truck driver ran away after the scene while the conductor was said to have been mobbed by angry residents before Police rescued him.  The Delta acting Police spokesman, DSP Edafe Bright confirmed the incident to The Nation, Wednesday, but could still not ascertain the whereabouts of the driver. “I have two casualties for now. I don’t know if they have discovered another one. I know the conductor was rescued from being mobbed and is currently in our custody,” Bright stated.
