Nigeria Insurance Social Trust Fund (NSITF) has joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) to call for investments to be made in a strong and resilient Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) system to mitigate present and future emergencies. It said the novel COVID-19 has made investing in a strong OSH system a prerogative in the workplace as it will ensure employees’ safety and health while supporting the business survival and continuity. The fund stated this as it marks the International Labour Organisation World Day for Safety and Health at Work 2021, with a roadshow. The Assistant General Manager and Branch Manager of the Satellite branch, Chinyere Onyeukwu said the roadshow was to educate the public, especially employers of labour on the need and importance of having and practicing safety in the workplace; and also propagate ILO’s 2021 safety theme of “Anticipate, Prepare and Respond to Crisis as an ongoing agenda.’’
