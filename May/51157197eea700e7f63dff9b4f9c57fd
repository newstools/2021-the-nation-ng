The Federal Government has declared Wednesday 12th and Thursday 13th May, as Public Holidays to mark this year’s Eid-il-Fitr. Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, made the declaration yesterday. He congratulated the Muslim faithful on the occasion and called on all Nigerians, at home and abroad to use the Sallah period to pray for peace, stability and economic transformation in the land. Aregbesola in a statement signed by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr Shuaib Belgore, said development cannot thrive in a rancorous atmosphere. He urged Nigerians to be law-abiding and embrace the spirit of love, self-discipline, and tolerance, as taught by Prophet Muhammad. He also called on all security agencies to be more courageous and patriotic to surmount the battle against insecurity and activities of criminal elements. He assured that President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was resolved to end crime and criminality in the country. “This administration will not be deterred in its efforts, until every Nigerian and resident of the country, is free to move around without fear of any threat to his/her life and property. We are, therefore, putting necessary measures and strategies in place to strengthen the stability of the country as well as ensuring economic prosperity of our dear nation,” he said.
