FIFA match agent Jairo Pachon has said the friendly between Mexico and the Super Eagles on July 3 in Los Angeles, USA, will be a top-class match played at a classy venue. “We are happy to be able to announce this match, which is a clash between two very big teams from two different continents,” said Pachon of Eurodata Sport. “Mexico against Nigeria is a big match any day and the venue is class.” The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is the match venue. It is a 77,000-capacity facility, which has hosted the 1996 Olympics football event, which Nigeria won. Both teams are expected to announce their squads next month. Mexico are 11th in the FIFA Ranking, while Nigeria are 32nd. They are also the current holders of the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which they have won eight times.
