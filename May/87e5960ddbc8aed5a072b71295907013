Founder of Living Faith Church Worldwide, Bishop David Oyedepo, has warned members of his church against taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Oyedepo claimed the vaccines are “deadly” and untested. He however recommended a shot of anointing oil to kill the virus. Oyedepo spoke at the church’s 40th anniversary service on Sunday. The fiery bishop said he would offer his service at no cost. “They should come to me to find out how to deal with COVID-19 at no cost,” he said. He said: “Let me warn you against this deadly thing circulated around the country because it has not been duly tested. “An elder of this church, who works with the World Health Organisation, confirmed this, thanking me for always speaking the truth about the authenticity of the COVID-19 vaccine.” He said it is an “insult” for health workers to visit churches to vaccinate people. “Did I tell anyone I am sick? Don’t let anyone harass you into doing what you don’t want to do “What an insult! What an assault! Nobody has the right to enforce vaccination on you, and anybody cannot terminate your employment because you refuse to take the vaccine, my God will show up (for you). “They wanted Africa dead. I heard them say it. When we didn’t die as they proposed, they brought out this vaccination scheme. “You need to hear their proclamation that Africa will lack spaces to bury corpses. But, today, the reverse is the case. Africa has the least casualty among all the other continents of the world.”
