 In commemorating the World Press Day, members of Union of Campus Journalists, IBB University,Lapai, (IBBUL) Niger State,  organised a rally  last week to celebrate the country’s  living  and fallen journalism heroes. They also created  more awareness on press freedom. The rally, which was taken to strategic locations on campus,  was led by Vice President (Administration)  Hamzat Ibrahim Abaga, who represented the President, Zainab Abdullahim and the Vice President, Editorial, Mohammed Yakubu. During their visit to the campus radio, Click 89.9 FM,  the station’s Programme Head, Mr. Ubong Mpkesit, praised  the young journalists for taking their future into their hands. “The best profession to practise  is  journalism. When I die and I am  told to come back, the profession I will love to practise is journalism,” Ubong said.  Commenting  on this year’s theme:” Information as a public good,”  he stressed the importance of information to ensuring security in society. He, however, urged the young  journalists to keep fighting for the freedom of the press. The union called for synergy between the school’s security unit and campus journalists, adding that that will bridge the information gap between the management and the students with  regard to security. While addressing the members of the union at the Faculty of Languages and Communication Studies,  Director of Quality Assurance of IBBUL, Prof. Olusegun Ebenezer Ogungbe, urged the union to work tirelessly and make its impact felt in the institution. “Let’s feel your presence on  campus as vibrant and upcoming journalists who’ll uplift the nation to greater heights,” he said.
