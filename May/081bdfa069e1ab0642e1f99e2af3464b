 President Muhammadu Buhari would be attending an emergency Extraordinary Summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Accra, Ghana, today, Sunday. The meeting, which is at the instance of the Chairman of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS and President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, was convened to discuss recent political developments in Mali. This was contained in a statement issued by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in Abuja yesterday. Prior to the Extraordinary Summit, the President had met with the Special Envoy and ECOWAS mediator in Mali, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who briefed him on the latest developments in the country following his meeting with key political actors in the West African country.  As the situation in Mali continues to evolve, Nigeria had condemned the May 24 military coup, the subsequent detention of the president and prime minister by soldiers, and called for the immediate and unconditional release of all civilian officials detained. President Buhari will be accompanied by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Salihi Magashi (Rtd), Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Richard Adebayo, and Director-General of National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Ahmed Rufai Abubakar. He is expected back in Abuja at the end of the one-day Summit.
