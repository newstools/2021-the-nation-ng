 International Airlines Group (AIG)  Cargo has reported a 50 per cent revenue increase to €350 million in the first quarter of the year. The figure represents a first quarter record for the company. The increase was attributed to the 1,306 cargo-only flights operated in the first quarter, up from 969 in the fourth quarter of last year. Yield for the quarter was also up 106 per cent at constant currency versus last year, the cargo arm of International Airlines Group (IAG) said, reflecting the ongoing market supply and demand imbalance. Sold tonnes were down 20.9 per cent. Despite an increase in load factor, total cargo carried, measured in cargo tonne kilometres, fell by 27.2 per cent due to a reduction in passenger schedules. IAG Cargo noted that its premium ‘Critical’ service for urgent and emergency shipments experienced its highest ever booking volumes in March as demand increased for high priority shipments. “There was real variety in these critical shipments with movements, including ophthalmic instruments, aircraft parts and a generator from Sweden to Jamaica following multiple power outages on the island,” the company said. “We have made a strong start to 2021, building on the success of 2020. Through hard work and dedication, our team continued to provide solutions for our customers to keep world trade operating, drawing on an extensive charter offering and our global network,” said IAG Cargo’s chief financial officer Elizabeth Haun. “We continued to play our part in the fight against Covid-19, transporting PPE and testing kits around the world and in February we were appointed as an airline partner to UNICEF’s ‘Humanitarian Airfreight Initiative’, supporting the COVAX facility. Meanwhile, the dramatic rise in e-commerce amid movement restrictions induced by COVID-19 increased online retail sales’ share of total retail sales from 16 per cent  to 19 per cent  in 2020, according to estimates in a report. Additionally, the report estimates that global e-commerce sales jumped to $26.7 trillion in 2019, up  four per cent  from 2018, according to the latest available estimates. This includes business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) sales and is equivalent to 30 per cent  of global gross domestic product (GDP) that year. The report shows that the value of global B2B e-commerce in 2019 at $21.8 trillion, representing 82 per cent  of all e-commerce. The United States continued to dominate the overall e-commerce market, ahead of Japan and China. Meanwhile, B2C e-commerce sales were estimated at $4.9 trillion in 2019, up 11 per cent  over 2018. The top three countries by B2C e-commerce sales remained China, the United States and the United Kingdom.
