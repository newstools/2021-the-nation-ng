To mark this year’s World Malaria Day, Itel, one of Africa’ smartphones, accessories, and televisions manufacturer has partnered with Amatem Softgel, an anti- malaria drug and Drug-Aid Africa, a non governmental organisation (NGO) that provides medical  supplies and support to low-income patients in Nigeria and across Africa. In line with the theme of this year’s World Malaria Day, ‘Zero Malaria Starts with Me’, the three brands have joined the global fight against malaria by donating treated mosquito nets, free medical tests, mosquito repellent cream and free anti-malaria drugs to over 1,500 households in Isale-Akoka Community, Bariga, Lagos State. Malaria is a prevalent disease in sub-Saharan Africa, and is responsible for thousands of deaths yearly. However, as socially responsible organisations, itel, Amatem Softgel, and Drug-Aid Africa believe that they have a quota to contribute in ensuring a relatively healthier society. Oke Umurhohwo, itel’s Marketing Manager for West Africa and Nigeria, said:, ‘We always try to bridge the gap in low-income communities through our Love Always On CSR initiative. And partnering with Amatem Softgel and Drug Aid Africa to provide these communities with an even greater fighting chance against malaria is a part of our commitment to them.’’ ‘Malaria is a life-threatening disease, but it is preventable and curable’, said Shivakumar, GM/COO at Elbe Pharma. ‘We at Elbe continue to find a better way to combat this disease, support the vulnerable ones especially the young children. Hence, the introduction of this innovative anti-malaria brand AMATEM SOFTGEL and this CSR partnership.’ In the words of Oluseyi Sanyaolu, Programme Officer, Drug-Aid Africa, ‘Malaria has been ravaging the vulnerable in the society for years. That is why Drug-Aid Africa is dedicated to supporting those in indigent communities with medicines and medical supplies. Together, we can end this menace.’
