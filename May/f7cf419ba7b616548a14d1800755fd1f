With the kick-off of the 2021 NTTF National Championships, 12-year-old Mathew Kuti believes he has the wherewithal to dominate the tournament. Kuti has been in fine form after he claimed the U-13 and U-15 titles at the recently concluded 14th Aso Cup in Abuja and he will be on duty at the national tournament from May 18 to 22. “It promises to be exciting, particularly playing in Lagos in front of my fans’,”the Ikorodu-based player said. “I must also admit that it is not going to be an easy task for me because I know most of the players are on the lookout for me after my performance in Abuja. “I am always ready because I am not only playing to win but I am hoping to get a national call-up with my performance.” Kuti who will be listed by Lagos State for the five-day tournament said he would relax as he has been training ahead in order to raise his game. Hundreds of players across the country have continued to perfect their registration for the N4.5m prize money tournament as organisers said COVID-19 protocols will be observed during the tournament.
