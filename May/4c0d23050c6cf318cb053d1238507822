As the 2020-21 season draws to a close, Nigeria’s trio of Simy Nwankwo, Zaidu Sanusi and Paul Onuachu has been listed among ESPN’s top 10 Africa’s breakout stars of the outgoing season. According to ESPN, the selected players burst onto the scene this term, and this took their careers to new heights during a memorable campaign in the outgoing football season across Europe. Zanusi has been described as a relative unknown when he was signed by FC Porto in August as a replacement for Manchester United-bound Alex Telles, but the Nigerian has been a revelation for the Portuguese side. Also, Simy had already tasted life in Serie A before this season, but 10 goals across two seasons — and 44 appearances — did little to suggest that he would be such a remarkable success in the top flight this term. The towering front man has been outstanding for relegated Crotone, scoring 20 goals for the league’s second-bottom club to finish joint-fifth in the goal scoring charts. Onuachu who was named as the best player in the Belgian league is another Nigeria striker who can look back on a fine campaign, while he has taken his game to a whole new level in 2020-21. Last term, he registered nine goals in 22 games — finding the net approximately once every 170 minutes — but has improved his output dramatically this season. The 6’7 front man has registered 33 goals in 38 outings for Genk, scoring once every 89 minutes and maintaining the kind of scoring rate that none of the continent’s strikers can rival. His goals helped Genk to secure Champions League qualification next season. Other players listed include Amad Diallo (Cote d’Ivoire), Silas Wamangituka (Congo DRC), M’Bala Nzola (Angola), Wesley Fofana (Mali), Michael Olise (Nigeria/Algeria), Amine Gouiri (Algeria) and Aurelien Tchouameni (Cameroon)
