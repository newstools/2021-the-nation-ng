Egbin Power Plc host communities in Ijede, Egbin and Ipakan in Ijede Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Ikorodu, Lagos are seeking employment and other benefits from the firm, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and Nigeria Gas Company (NGC). They lamented that they were not enjoying “host community” benefits despite sacrificing “over 632 hectares of land to the federal government in 1981, on which the power station was constructed. Egbin power is the country’s largest power generating station with an installed capacity of 1,320MW and the communities’ youths said they had provided a peaceful and conducive business environment for its business to thrive. In a media parley on Tuesday, they urged the firm to reciprocate the goodwill it had benefitted, by considering their sons and daughters for quality jobs, among other corporate social responsibility (CSR) benefits. Coordinator, Ijede Egbin youth forum, Olumide Musediq, who spoke for the communities, said they had been clamouring for good and respectable jobs from these companies to no avail. He said: “All they care to offer us are security, cleaning and other menial jobs with a ridiculous salary that cannot train a single child, yet they employ almost yearly. “As we speak, we have more than 500 graduates across the communities with good grades and more than 1,000 students in different higher institutions both home and abroad in different disciplines, yet they claim we are not qualified to fit in for most of the blue-collar jobs.”
