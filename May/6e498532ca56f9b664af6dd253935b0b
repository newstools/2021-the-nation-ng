A mentally challenged woman was on Tuesday lynched and set ablaze by a mob over her alleged possession of firearms. The incident occurred at Abule Ado Underbridge in the Amuwo Odofin area of the state. It was alleged that the woman had three AK47 rifles in a sack, which raised suspicion she might be working in cohorts with armed robbers or kidnappers. She was also accused of having a stolen baby, claims the police have described as false and unfounded. According to a statement by police spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, investigation had commenced into the murder of the mentally challenged woman and those responsible would be prosecuted for murder when arrested. He said preliminary investigation revealed the woman neither had any baby nor firearms as alleged, adding that those who killed her did so for reasons best known to them. Adejobi said the police found out the woman had lived in the area for many years. “The command wishes to state categorically that the woman was just murdered for reasons best known to the perpetrators of the heinous crime as investigation revealed that no baby and AK47 rifles were found in her possession neither were they recovered by the perpetrators or the police. It’s just a clear case of murder. “The Commissioner of Police has therefore ordered that the matter be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba, for proper investigation and the culprits should be arrested and charged to court with murder. “The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu, also warned against jungle justice which is inhumane, criminal and detrimental to smooth Administration of Criminal Justice in Lagos and in Nigeria at large. “He equally warned that the command will not tolerate such act as the long arm of the law will catch up with anyone or group of persons who engage in jungle justice in the state,” said Adejobi.
