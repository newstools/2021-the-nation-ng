By OLUSHOLA  RICKETTS  When a man is diligent in his work, he will always find God’s favour. Otunba Olusegun Runsewe has found another favour, as he has been reappointed as the DG of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC). Since the news became public knowledge, he has been receiving congratulatory messages. For people who know him well, however, the reappointment didn’t come as a surprise. They’re of the conviction that he has done a lot to push the council forward since he took over as the DG. Consistency is key in whatever we do in life and Runsewe has remained consistent in the Media, Culture and Tourism Sectors in Nigeria for years. He worked as Marketing Manager at the New Nigerian Newspaper and rose to the position of General Manager at the organisation. He also worked as the Head of Public Relations (Media), National Theatre; Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Sports Weekly, and was the Publisher and Editor-in-chief of National Network Newspapers. He was also the Media Coordinator, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 2013 held in Abuja, Nigeria.  In 2000, Otunba Runsewe was appointed Executive Director at the National Orientation Agency, a position he held until his appointment as the Director-General of the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) in August 2006. He received commendations during his tenure at NTDC, especially in the development of the Tourism Sector in Nigeria. Runsewe became DG of NCAC in 2017 and he has continued to shape the vision of the council as a tool for national unity, peace and social integration, and as machinery for stimulating rapid socio-economic growth and development.
