Bandits yesterday took a police patrol team in Sokoto unawares and opened fire, killing one policeman. The incident happened about 1.45am in the Rumjin Sambo area of the capital, near Usmanu Danfodio University main campus. Residents said they saw a large number of the assailants on motorcycles who later abandoned their bikes and went on foot close to a mosque around Noma Hospital where a sizable number of Muslim faithful gathered for the tahajjud prayer.  Sources said a police patrol van moved close to the scene and the bandits on sighting them opened fire, killing one of the policemen. Residents said the police team chased the bandits shooting but could not hit or arrest any of them. Police spokesman Abubakar Sanusi did not confirm the incident before press time.
