The Chairman Air Peace Airline, Chief Allen Onyema, has asked Nigerians to support young people to achieve their dreams by supporting their education. Chief Onyema who said this while delivering his speech as Chairman at the Dominican University Ibadan Virtual Fund rasing evernt last Saturday, warned that the country was doomed if education lacked support. “You can only be remembered for the lives you touch or the legacy you leave behind,” he said, as he appealed to Nigerians to contribute to education at all levels by donating structures for future leaders to learn in a conducive environment. Onyema attributed the high rate of kidnapping and other vices to persistent neglect of education.  He called for support for Dominican University which was seeking funds for its Faculty of Social Science building “Not focusing on education, we have a high number of people who take to kidnapping for ransom and other vices that cause insecurity in Nigeria. There is need for all Nigerians to support the Dominican University because the university is providing education with learning and good character formation,”  he said, adding that he was supporting the university’s style of education, which he said was most suitable for Nigeria. The Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Dominican University, Emeritus Catholic Archbishop of Ibadan, the Most Reverend Felix Alaba Job, urged all Nigerians to help educational institutions seeing that government is cannot do it alone. In his Keynote Address entitled, “Building posterity for posterity”, Vice Chancellor of the university, Reverend Father Professor Anthony Akinwale appealed to well-meaning Nigerians to support the construction of the university’s Faculty of Social Sciences by building a block that would be named after the donor or partner “To educate is to build persons, and to build persons is to build a new society,” he said. The Dominican University in Ibadan is a place “where we educate future technocrats with ethical competence, building posterity for prosperity by enabling our students to prepare for a future when they will be able to work for their own good by working for the common good.”
