 The Rotary Club District 9141 has revealed that it channelled its programme to the feeding of 10 million people within the district during the COVID-19 period. The District’s Governor, Mrs Virginia Mayor, who spoke in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, said the District, which comprises Edo, Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states carried out the humanitarian programme under Rotary’s Feed the Family Initiative to cushion the effects of the pandemic. She said each food pack designed for a family of six costs N9, 500 and contained basic food items such as rice, beans, and oil, among other items. She said all the 112 clubs in the district responded positively to the programme and made necessary financial contributions to actualise it. She said the district also provided Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in major hospitals and mobile testing centres for COVID-19 to help in containing the virus. She said Rotarian give-back conference had been scheduled  to hold from today May 19 to May 22 in Port Harcourt with keynote speakers drawn from different walks of life. “The conference will be a time for connection and reconnection, a time to learn, train and have fun with others as well as mark the end of the year,” she said. Major said the district executed projects in the core areas of water, sanitation and hygiene, mother and child health, peacebuilding and conflict prevention, basic education and literacy, community economic development, disease prevention and treatment. She said the club recently added environment to its core mandates to deal with issues affecting the district.
