Nollywood actress Eucharia Anunobi has attained the highest academic qualification. The veteran actress shocked everyone when she announced she had given her life to Christ.
She eventually became an ordained evangelist in 2012 at the Fresh Oil Ministry Church, Egbeda, Lagos founded by Pastor Sam Okpe. The movie star was recently conferred with a Ph.D. in theology and one of her colleagues in the movie industry shared the beautiful moment Eucharia was given the honour. In one of the videos shared on her page, Eucharia was spotted dressed in black attire speaking with a microphone while standing before a body of lecturers. According to Maureen, the actress was giving her defense in that particular video. She captioned the video: “@euchariaanunobi giving her defense Congratulations bigsis on your conferment of a PhD degree. More grace and showers of blessings on your ministry. God be with you always. More and more and more in JESUS Mighty Name Amen.” In another video, Eucharia was spotted being decorated with her full academic regalia with an accompanying caption that read; “What a day Big congratulations again Sis @euchariaanunobi
Behold Dr Apostle Eucharia Anunobi more wins sisterly.” Friends and fans have congratulated Dr. Eucharia, as many talked about how much they miss seeing her on their screens.
