Although Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.51 per cent in first quarter (Q1) of the year, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the prevailing economic circumstances and the struggling state of the manufacturing sector remain worrisome, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said yesterday. MAN reacted to the Q1 2021 report of the NBS released over weekend revealing that the economy again witnessed a successive positive growth rate following the 0.11 per cent recorded in Q4 2020. It said the economy was beginning to recover from the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit with the other operating challenges in the economy.“We are mindful of the negative impact of the depreciation in naira value and acute shortage of forex as they remained huge challenges in the quarter,” it said. Its Director-General Segun Ajayi-Kadir in a statement, however, said it would appear that the reported result might mark the beginning of a tortuous journey back to the path of recovery and growth. He said the situation called for more intentional actions from government, focused on supporting productive activities to drive better performance in the remaining quarters of the year. “Frankly speaking, the 0.40 per cent growth rate differential is moderate. Caution must be applied, as this performance when examined in the mirror of 2019, results show below par growth rate. “Meaning it will amount to error of judgment to ascribe better performance by comparing Q1 2021 with Q4 2020, a year like no other that was heavily challenged by COVID-19 and a period that growth was largely driven by full easing of lockdown, seasonal and festive driven demand for goods and services,” the MAN DG said. LCCI Director-General, Dr Muda Yusuf said a marginal improvement in real GDP growth from 0.11 per cent in Q4 of 2020 to 0.51 per cent in Q1 of 2021 was noticed but added that the economy was still struggling to recover from the shocks of the pandemic and slip into recession.
