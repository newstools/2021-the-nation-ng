Bandits on Wednesday killed the eldest son of Emir of Kontagora, Alhaji Bashar Saidu Namaska, in his father’s farm. The bandits also killed others working on the farm located along Zuru road in Kontagora, Niger state. The late Emir’s son is the Sardauna of Kontagora and was said to have been holding the forte for his father, Sarkin Sudan, Alhaji Saidu Namaska, who has been sick for some months.

A top government official confirmed the incident, saying the death of the Emir’s son has been formally announced. He also informed he had been buried according to Islamic rites. “It is true that bandits invaded Kontagora town and shot and killed several people including the Emir’s son. “After the shot by the bandits, the Emir’s son was rushed to the hospital but he was confirmed dead on arrival. “His death has been formally announced and he has been buried.” Sources said after the attack on the Emir’s son, the bandits began a stop- and- search on commercial and private vehicles plying the road collecting valuables of passengers.
