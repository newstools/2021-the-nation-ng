Liverpool took a huge step towards claiming one of the two remaining top-four spots with one round of Premier League games to go courtesy of a victory at Burnley that was harder work than the scoreline suggests. Liverpool’s incredible late win at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday kept their Champions League hopes alive and they took full advantage on Wednesday through a cool finish from Roberto Firmino, a first club goal for Nathaniel Phillips and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s late lashed effort. The Reds are now in the fourth Champions League spot, level on points with fifth-placed Leicester City and with a goal difference four better than the Foxes. Brazil striker Firmino added to the brace he scored at Manchester United six days ago with a neat side-foot strike from Andy Robertson’s pull-back to the penalty spot. Centre-back Phillips then headed in Sadio Mane’s cross early in the second half to give Liverpool a cushion. Substitute Oxlade-Chamberlain sealed the win in injury time, smashing home a shot after a neat turn to evade Charlie Taylor. Three goals was, in truth, a poor return from a game packed with excellent opportunities for both sides. Chris Wood was a menace throughout and should have netted with a shot from close range while Mohamed Salah and especially Thiago Alcantara – who dragged an angled shot wide of the far post – were culpable for Liverpool.
