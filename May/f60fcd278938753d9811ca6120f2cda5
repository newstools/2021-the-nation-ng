A man and his son were yesterday abducted by gunmen in the Kuchiko Relocation Development Area (KRDA) of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The gunmen numbering over 20 invaded the community popularly known as El-Rufa’i Estate at midnight and shot rapidly in the air. An eyewitness said they overpowered security guards and headed for the house of the victim. There was panic among the residents of the estate, who were woken up by the sound of gunshots. It was gathered that the invaders, who operated for an hour, later proceeded to the house of another resident and attempted to kidnap him. However, the timely arrival of soldiers from the Defence College, Bwari saved the situation after a gun battle with the gunmen. Some residents of the area, who recounted their ordeals, called on the authorities to beef up security around the satellite areas. The satellite towns in the FCT have been experiencing incidents of kidnapping for a while now, especially in Gwagwalada and Kuje area councils. The Bwari Area Council Divisional Police Officer (DPO) could not be reached to confirm the story as at press time. But spokesman Yusuf Mariam confirmed the incident. She told our correspondent that the police has launched a high powered operation to rescue the victims and arrest the suspect. Her words: “We have launched a strategic operation to rescue the victims unhurt and we are also trailing the suspects”.
