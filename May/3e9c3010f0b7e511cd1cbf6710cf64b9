The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has said that approval has been granted for the establishment of 20 federal marriage registries to ease access to statutory marriages. He also said that plans were afoot to extend the gesture to all the states of the federation. Aregbesola, who made the disclosure during the 2021 National Stakeholders’ Conference on the Administration of Statutory Marriage in Abuja on Friday, said the move had become imperative because of the prevailing challenges associated with marriages in the country. Represented by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Dr Shuaib Belgore, the minister noted that the ministry was responsible for the conduct of statutory marriages in Nigeria, as well as licensing of public places of worship for the celebration of statutory marriages in line with the Marriage Act Cap M6, LFN 2004 as amended. He said: “I have approved the establishment of 20 new Federal Marriage Registries and efforts are ongoing to have Federal Marriage Registries in all the state capitals of the federation.” The minister explained that all these efforts were geared towards ensuring that marriages were conducted in Nigeria in line with the marriage Act for the benefit of the people involved. He said: “The Marriage Act, which was originally enacted in 1914 by the British colonial masters, is the legislation that provides the procedures for the conduct of statutory marriages in Nigeria. “However, the Act has been amended several times with the latest version being 2004. “It is my utmost pleasure, therefore, to inform you about one of the major achievements of the ministry, which is the successful review of the contents of the 2nd Schedule to the Marriage Act known as the Legal Notices.”
