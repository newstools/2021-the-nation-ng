Serie A sides Lazio are interested in signing Super Eagles striker Paul Onuachu from Genk this summer, according to Italian radio ReelRadio. Onuachu has been by some clear distance the best striker in Belgium over the current campaign, with the 26-year-old netting his 34th goal of the campaign in Wednesday’s 1-1 draw against Anderlecht. No Nigerian striker has ever smashed in more goals in a single season in any of Europe’s ten leagues. That incredible haul includes 32 goals in the Belgian Pro Division A and another two strikes in the FA Cup, which Genk lifted a couple of weeks ago. The former FC Midtjylland ace also found the back of the net twice in as many games for the Super Eagles during the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in March. His late winner against the Benin Republic in Porto Novo was crucial to helping the three-time African champions book their qualification ticket to Cameroon 2022 with a game to spare. All these have seen Onuachu’s profile rise above the ceiling, with Genk expected to demand more than 30 million euros for a man they got for one-fifth that fee only two years ago.
