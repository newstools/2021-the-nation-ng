The defence chairman of Igbudu Community, Warri South council area of Delta State, Mr. Emion Oghenegweke-Ayiwe, has been shot dead by unknown gunmen. This is coming barely 48 hours after the lifeless and bruised body of the community’s defence secretary, Victor Midehire, was found floating on Warri River, with his hands and legs tied. The chairman’s killing occurred early Sunday morning, around the Hausa Quarters axis of Warri-Sapele Road, throwing the people into mourning. Community sources claim that the defence chairman was assassinated. “The news came in this morning (Sunday) that, Emio is dead. This is not the first time we are having this kind of killing within this month. “The secretary of the defence was also killed. Before they killed him, they tired his hands, legs and mouth and then threw him inside a river. “Today, they have killed the chairman and collected his gun from him,” the source said. The acting Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Edafe Bright, confirmed the incident, but could not ascertain if it was an assassination. “Yes, a man died. But the circumstances surrounding his death are not known for now. So, we cannot say whether he was assassinated or not,” he stated.
