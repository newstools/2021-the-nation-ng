 Former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant in Imo State, Senator Samuel Anyanwu has decried what he described as marginalisation of the Southeast in federal appointments under President Muhammadu Buhari. He said the best way to foster peace is to give every part of the country a sense of belonging. Anyanwu, who spoke to reporters in Owerri, the state capital, said the Southeast has been virtually abandoned in sensitive federal appointments under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He said such an attitude would make it difficult to unite Nigerians, particularly when those in power are afraid of restructuring.  Anyanwu urged the Presidency and the National Assembly to work towards restructuring, to guarantee peace by giving every region the opportunity to grow at their own pace. He said, if those canvassing for peace were genuine, they would have first accepted restructuring of the country as a major option. He expressed optimism that by so doing, they would guarantee the unity of Nigeria. Anyanwu warned politicians creating crisis in the Southeast to desist from such acts because it is capable of undermining the development of the region. He advised them to sensitise their colleagues from the North on the need to foster peace and a healthy rivalry among the zones through restructuring.
