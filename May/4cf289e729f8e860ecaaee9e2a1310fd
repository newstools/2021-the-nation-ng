  The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday alleged that the Kaduna State government plans to infiltrate its protest with thugs. It said it was misled in praising the Nasir El-Rufai administration for being the first to pay the new N30,000 minimum wage. NLC, in a statement by its Kaduna State Council Chairman, Ayuba Suleiman, said the state had since reverted to the old wage of N18, 000 for council workers. It said 20,000 civil servants have been receiving half salary of less than N18, 000. The workers union said the state owed its members several allowances.  It condemned threats to arrest NLC President Ayuba Wabba. “We are calling the attention of the general public to the planned mobilisation of thugs by the state government to discredit our peaceful protest. We urge the people of Kaduna State to be vigilant and stand against this plan. “We implore the general public to remain calm and peaceful throughout the five-day warning strike. “We are assuring the Kaduna State workers and the general public of our commitment to maintaining peaceful strike action in their interest,” Suleiman said.
