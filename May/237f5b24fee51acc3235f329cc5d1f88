Nigeria continues its build-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games as the relay team departed for the United States yesterday to take part in relay qualifiers. The 16-man  team including coaches decked in their new kits were seen off by the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare.  The team had almost three weeks camping in Abuja in preparation for the relay races in the United States which serves as qualifiers for the Olympics after missing out of the World Relays in Poland due to visa hitches. Secretary General of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) Niyi Beyioku said an advance party had been to the U.S  to fine-tune all arrangements as a mark of the commitment of the Minister to ensure a hitch-free event and podium success in Tokyo. Beyioku added: “The Athletes have trained very well and are motivated to make the country proud. All the COVID-19 protocols for a successful trip have been carried out. To underscore the importance of the trip, the minister lived up to his promise to see the athletes off to motivate them to make Nigeria proud by qualifying for the Olympics and winning medals.” The team would take part in the first relay on May 9.
