ABIA State practically stood still when former Chairperson, House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Relations, Hon. Nnenna Elendu-Ukeje, was hosted to a grand civic reception by youths in her Bende Federal Constituency. Governor Okezie Ikpeazu led a long list of dignitaries to the colourful event held at the Bende Stadium. Ikpeazu hailed Elendu-Ukeje as an invaluable asset to Abia people, saying she is the “jewel of Abia politics”. The governor further stated that Abia needs individuals like her to get involved in contributing their own quota to the development of the state. The governor noted that Elendu-Ukeje’s presence which made Abia visible in the National Assembly was being greatly missed. He emphasised that the greatest resource of Abia is the people and outstanding individuals like the former lawmaker. The former lawmaker, who has been basking in the level of success of the ceremony organised by Bende Youths Forum and Abia Democratic Initiative, described the love shown her as ‘unquantifiable.’ She said: “I am very grateful to my people. My homecoming was such an elaborate event. We had the people coming out in their numbers. The people arranged such a successful event on their own. They taxed themselves; such expression of love doesn’t happen in the political space. It was a huge event with my people inviting the governor, the Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, the Deputy Speaker and the PDP state chairman and they all spoke glowingly of me. It was such a wonderful experience.”
