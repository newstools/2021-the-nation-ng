You, the King’s slave
Who never stopped thinking
He was the King of Slaves Then, overreach, the Tyrant’s timeless curse:
You tumbled into twilight, then
The seething purgatory of traitors. . . . A gentle flame twirls skywards
From an unmarked mound near the city gate
Behold, Sankara rising. . . . (Concluded)
