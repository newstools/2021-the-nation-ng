ROBERT Lewandowski equalled Gerd Mueller’s 49-year-old scoring record as the Bayern Munich striker netted his 40th Bundesliga goal of the season in a 2-2 draw at Freiburg on Saturday. Lewandowski, FIFA’s best male player of 2020, has equalled Mueller’s tally, scored over 34 games in 1971⁄72, in just 28 league fixtures this term. Lewandowski converted a penalty for the champions after 26 minutes to equal the league’s record. As part of his penalty celebrations, the Poland striker lifted his match shirt to reveal a picture of Gerd Mueller over the text “4ever Gerd”. The fixture was briefly halted after Lewandowski equalled Mueller’s milestone as his Bayern team-mates made a guard-of-honour on the side of the pitch which the smiling 32-year-old ran through. Freiburg drew level almost immediately when Manuel Gulde headed in at the near post from a corner on 29 minutes after slipping his marker. Bayern, who were crowned German champions last weekend for the ninth season in a row, upped the tempo after the break.
