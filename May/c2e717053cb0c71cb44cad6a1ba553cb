Wales manager and former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs will face trial next year accused of deliberately head-butting his ex-girlfriend and controlling her throughout their relationship. In a 15-minute hearing at Manchester Crown Court yesterday the date was fixed for proceedings to take place at the same court on January 24, 2022. It is alleged that Giggs, 47, assaulted Kate Greville, 36, and caused her actual bodily harm at his home in Greater Manchester on November 1 last year. The Wales boss is also said to have engaged in controlling and coercive behaviour towards her between December 2017 and November 2020.  Giggs is also charged with the common assault by beating of Greville’s youngster sister, Emma Greville, in the same alleged incident on November 1. The former winger, wearing a blue suit and tie, spoke only to confirm his name shortly after he entered the dock. Giggs was not asked to enter his formal pleas but has denied all the allegations and previously issued a statement in which he said he looked forward to “clearing my name”. He remains on conditional bail. The Football Association of Wales confirmed in April that caretaker boss Robert Page, who has overseen matches since November, would remain in charge for Euro 2020, which starts next month.
