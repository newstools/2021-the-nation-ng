TV personality Toke Makinwa has disclosed the biggest asset she looks for in a man. According to her, consistency remains the value she admires most in a man. She tweeted: “Truth is we as you grow older you ‘ll realise how much easier it is to be straight up with yourself first. I hardly tell lies these days because to be honest, no one is feeding me. “I don’t need to waste my own time sugar coating words or not matching energy everyone will be ok. “As a woman in the space/stage I’m at now, there’s nothing I find more attractive in a man than more attractive in a man than consistency, that “do as I would” energy is so admirable, I fuck with that.”
