Social media users have begun to celebrate music star Davido ahead of his 10th anniversary on stage. Every May 9, fans celebrate the award winning “Aye” crooner as the date is regarded as Davido Day. Even though the set day for the official 10 years celebration is on the 9th, Tweeps have decided to set the ball rolling today in anticipation of the D-day. Davido came to the music industry in 2011 with his debut single “Back when” and mega hit song “Dami Duro”. Fellow artistes and fans of the “Omo Baba Olowo” crooner on social media have been eulogising his consistency over the years. @PulseNigeria247 tweeted: “10 years of good music and impact in the African music scene.
