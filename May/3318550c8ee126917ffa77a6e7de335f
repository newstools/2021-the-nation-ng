The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has cautioned agitators for a separate country that their quest will not solve the problems facing the country. It said an appraisal of the system at a round table to find common ground on how to live together as a united country should be the focus of all Nigerians. CAN President, Reverend Samson Ayokunle, who spoke in Akure, the Ondo State capital, noted that the clamour for restructuring and true federalism had been bastardised. Ayokunle said the agitation for the nation’s breakup was not the best option but a continuous democratic dialogue that would take care of the nation’s diversity. He said: “Let’s appraise and renew the way we are doing things. The word ‘restructuring’ has been bastardised and misunderstood. But there is no company or organisation that remains the same forever without going moribund. “There is need for appraisal, there is need for repositioning, there is need for upgrading in other for us to do things together.” Also, the General Secretary of Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Sola Ebiseni, said the implementation of the 2014 National Conference would save the country from exploding. In a statement in Akure, the Afenifere chieftain challenged the National Assembly to amend the constitution to accommodate necessary recommendations from the CONFAB report that would position the nation as a true federal state. “If the Goodluck Jonathan/PDP administration constituted a committee or a conference that came up with a report and the new government came up and constituted another committee headed by Mallam Nasir El-Rufai. He came up with a report and the report is a compendium of consensus of Nigerians on true federalism.” “I see Nigeria going confederate. Even the federalism we are talking about, I see that the autonomy of the states is going to be so wide beyond even the federalism we are talking about.”
