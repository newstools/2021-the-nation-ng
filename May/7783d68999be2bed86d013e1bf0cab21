Nigerian defender William Troost-Ekong has revealed that earning promotion to the English Premier League with Watford stands out as one of the best achievements in his career. The Hornets secured automatic promotion from the EFL Championship last weekend when they defeated Millwall 1-0, joining Norwich in returning to the English top flight less than a year after suffering relegation from it. Troost-Ekong joined Watford from Udinese in September 2020, swapping his gig in Serie A for the chance to try and help his new club earn their way back into the EPL. And after achieving exactly that, the 27-year-old Nigerian international ranks it as one of his best career moments.  “Playing for the Super Eagles was one of the biggest achievements in my young career,” he told ESPN. “I have had other moments in time that meant a lot to me, like the promotion with FC Dordrecht [in the Netherlands] when I was 20 or 21 and also playing consistently in Turkey. “Playing in the Serie A, playing at the World Cup, Olympics, there are so many different moments. But I feel like this one means a lot more now.”
