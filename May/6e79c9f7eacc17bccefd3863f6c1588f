Almeria forward Umar Sadiq may not be available for selection when Nigeria meet Cameroon in an international friendly slated for June 4th in Austria. Super Eagles head coach Gernot Rohr included the former youth international in the 31-man squad set to trade tackles with the Indomitable Lions during the next FIFA break. It is not a surprise call-up as Sadiq has been delivering spectacular performances for Almeria this season, scoring 18 goals and providing five assists in 35 league games. But Almeria may be reluctant to let go of their top striker for a friendly encounter during a crucial period of their season. The Rojiblancos, having high hopes of gaining promotion to La Liga this term, currently sit third in the Segunda Division and are favourites to make it to the playoffs. The promotion playoff semi-finals run through June 2 to June 6 – the weekend that Sadiq would have possibly been making his debut for the Super Eagles. It is unlikely that Almeria will allow the former AS Roma starlet to depart Spain when he could be leading the line for the club in their hunt for a promotion ticket. It would be recalled that the Spanish side stopped Sadiq from making his senior debut for Nigeria in March. Umar was part of Gernot Rohr’s 24-man squad named to face the Republic of Benin and Lesotho for the AFCON qualifiers. But La Union held on to their prized asset and stopped him from honouring the invitation, citing Covid-19 protocol breach as the reason, with Rohr replacing him with Enyimba’s Anayo Iwuala was duly called up as his replacement, with the youngster going on to earn his first two caps for the three-time African champions.
