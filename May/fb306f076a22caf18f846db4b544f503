 The Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Muda Yusuf, said yesterday that the increasing burden and the recurring debate on petroleum subsidy is an offshoot of the deregulation conundrum which is a major cause for concern. He said: “The subsidy regime in its current form is not sustainable. It is hurting the economy and investment. It also presents a huge platform for corruption. It is a complex matter which demands an alignment of some critical issues. “We have the huge economic cost of petroleum subsidy and the inherent huge fiscal leakages which are clearly unsustainable. There is the social and political cost of the possible increase in petrol prices and the worry about possible backlash.  “There is the adverse investment effect of the perpetuation of the subsidy regime on the petroleum downstream sector. There are policy uncertainties and inconsistencies. “No rational investor will invest in petroleum refining if the subsidy regime persists. Yet, we need investment to transform the sector. This is the dilemma we are faced as a country”. He added that  the  deregulation of the petroleum downstream sector was inevitable for the economy to progress and put an end to the bleeding and corruption that comes with the subsidy regime.  Yusuf canvassed a   policy transition that is both innovative and creative in strategy.
