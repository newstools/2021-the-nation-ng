The eighth edition of the Okpekpe international 10 km road race will hold in May 2022 in Okpekpe, Edo state of Nigeria, the organiser, Pamodzi Sports Marketing has announced. Okpekpe 10-km race, the first road race in West Africa to be granted a label by World Athletics and designated as one of the leading road races around the world, could not hold in 2020 and will not hold in 2021 due to Covid-19. ”We are happy to announce that the eighth edition of the silver-label Okpekpe international 10km road race will be held in May 2022,”said Mike Itemuagbor, CEO of Pamodzi Sports Marketing. ‘The outbreak of the Covid-19 ensured that, like many other label races across the globe, our event could not hold in 2020 and will not hold this year. “This is an international race that involves the invitation and participation of foreign athletes and their managers as well as the technical delegates from World Athletics and the government’s Covid-19 protocols in terms of travel and other logistics have to be enforced including the lockdown rules introduced by the Nigerian government,” he added. Itemuagbor thanked the Edo State government led by His Excellency Godwin Obaseki, and his Deputy, Comrade Phillip Shaibu, and the race sponsors for their concern and support and assured that the race will return bigger. ”Our target is to make the race the first gold label road race in West Africa. The race made history in 2015 when it became the first road running event to be granted a bronze label. Two years later, it scored another first as the first silver label road race to hold anywhere in West Africa and our target still remains the gold,” he said.
