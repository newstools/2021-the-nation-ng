 Head-teacher of a community school in Akwa Ibom State has cried out that his school is a stomping ground for all manner of outlaws including robbers and cultists. Mr. Inok Abraham, head teacher of Community Secondary School Idung Iniang in Eket council area told reporters yesterday that the school is a base for hoodlums and robbers as well as initiation ground for cultists. He said, ”There is no perimeter fencing in the school and because of that, thieves, hoodlums and cultists make it their boat. “The school is terrible or what I may call a stronghold of cultists. They come here to initiate children even while classes are going on in the afternoon. “You will see the cultists from the bush in mufti entering the school premises. While you are running after them this way they go out the other way,” he said He appealed to the state government to build more classroom blocks, and perimeter fencing to secure the students and environment.
