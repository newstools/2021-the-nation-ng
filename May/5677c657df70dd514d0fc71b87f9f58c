The  Minister of Youth and sports  Development Mr Sunday Dare  has affirmed that Nigeria  can only  assemble the best  Athletes in an Open National trial where everyone  will  be given equal  opportunity to qualify  for the Olympics. “Don’t forget that we would have the  National trials in June and everybody, both home-based and foreign-based must show up. If you don’t show up, you will not make  the  Nigerian team  to the Olympics” The Minister described the  National trials as an important avenue  to determine the best of Nigerian athletes  to be selected for  international meets. “National Trials are very important and any athlete that does not come will not make Team Nigeria, that is how important the  National trials is. It is  almost the second to the final point  where  we select our final list of athletes and after that it is the African championship in Algiers.  Even before I became the Minister, the National  trials played  an important role in the selection  of our team and every athlete knows that,” Dare said. He  urged the  athletes to remain focused and avoid distractions. “Nigeria would be at the Olympics, God willing and I’m confident that the athletes will put in  their very best and make Nigeria proud,” Dare concluded.
