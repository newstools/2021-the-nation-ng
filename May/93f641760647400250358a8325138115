The Principal of Community Secondary school, Idung Iniang, Eket local government area of Akwa Ibom state, Mr. Inok Abraham, has cried out that his school is a den for all manner of hoodlums including armed robbers and cultists. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Abraham disclosed that the school was used as initiation ground for cultists and operations of hoodlums and armed robbers. His words, ”There is no perimeter fence in the school and because of that thieves, hoodlums and cultists make this school their boat. “The school is terrible or what I may call a strong hold for cultists. They come here to initiate children even while the classes are going on in the afternoon. “You will see the cultists from the bush with mufti entering the school premises. While you are running after them this way they go out the other way,” he said He decried insufficient classrooms blocks for the high population of students in the school. The principal said that armed robbers broke into their science laboratory and carted away laboratory equipment in the school. “I have reported the case to the security agency and I had to swear an affidavit in the court that armed robbers cart away everything that makes a laboratory. “I have to pay money to hire equipment for sciences during the West Africa Examination Council (WAEC), in 2020 and after the examination, I have to return the equipment to the store we hired from,” he explained. He appealed to the state government to build perimeter fence in the school to secure the students and environment. “If the state government wants the school to be what they actually want it to be, I want them to extend the same humanitarian service they are doing in fencing public schools in Uyo to Eket and its environs. “We need a perimeter fence, once there is a perimeter fence here, there will be security in the school. “If the government could fence this school, I think our problem would be almost 80 per cent solved,” the principal said.
