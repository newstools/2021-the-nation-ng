Notable Nigerian celebrities have sent congratulatory messages to Samuel Chukwueze after Villarreal won the Europa League title by beating Manchester United on penalties. Chukwueze had been key to Villarreal’s run to the final, but he missed the showpiece last night after picking up a muscle injury in the second leg of the semifinal clash against Arsenal. It was initially hoped Chukwueze would feature in the final after returning to training in the days leading up to the encounter. But despite travelling with the squad to Poland, Chukwueze was not part of the matchday squad. However, that did not affect Villarreal as they stunned their more superior opponents in a penalty shootout to claim their first major European trophy. Chukwueze could not hide his excitement after the match, and he received many congratulatory messages from popular Nigerians, including Kanu Nwankwo, Mr P of the P-Square group and Asisat Oshoala. The Super Eagles winger is now the sixth Nigerian to win Europe’s second club competition.
