Tottenham’s hopes of finishing the season inside the Premier League’s top four took a huge blow as they suffered a 3-1 defeat at Leeds United. Spurs’ interim boss Ryan Mason had targeted four wins to finish the season and with Leicester’s surprise defeat at Newcastle on Friday, the door had just been opened for Spurs in the race to qualify for next season’s Champions League. However, they suffered an early set back when Stuart Dallas gave the hosts the lead in the 13th minute. Tottenham cancelled out Dallas’ opener to draw level in the 25th minute through Heung-Min Son, but Leeds regained the lead just before half-time as Patrick Bamford converted Ezgjan Alioski’s cut-back from close range.
