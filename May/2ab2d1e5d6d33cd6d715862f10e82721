The House of Representatives has shifted the national security summit convened to discuss ways of finding lasting solutions to insecurity in the country. The week-long summit earlier scheduled to begin on Monday, May 24, 2021 was moved to Wednesday, May 26, 2021. A statement by the Clark to the House, Chinedu Francis Akubueze, said the decision to shift the summit was taken as a mark of honour to the late Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 other military officers that died in a plane crash on Friday. The late Chief of Army Staff was one of the guests expected to make presentation during the summit. The statement reads: “The House shares in the grief and sorrow of the families of the late top military officers and prayed that the Almighty God will grant them eternal rest. “It should be noted that the postponement became necessary as the late Army Chief was one of the major stakeholders that would have taken part in the summit. The House regrets any inconvenience the postponement may cause invited guests”. Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila had announced the summit will be held behind closed doors with only members of the House and invited security experts in attendance. Gbajabiamila said the security chiefs will be expected to speak freely and bare their mind on the security challenges facing the nation with a view to finding ways to address it.
