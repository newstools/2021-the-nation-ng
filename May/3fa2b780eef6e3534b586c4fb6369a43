Former Super Eagles midfielder Seyi Olofinjana hopes to steer Grasshopper Club Zurich in the right direction as Switzerland’s most successful club announced his appointment as its new technical director. The Ex-Eagles replaces interim sports director Jimmy Berisha, who returns to his previous role as Managing Director, and will oversee the football department at the newly-promoted Super League outfit. His first official duty is to get a new coach for the 27-time Swiss champions, keen to bounce back from the humiliating lows of 2019 when it suffered relegation from the Swiss top flight for the first time in 68 years. Olofinjana holds two master’s degrees as a sports director and project manager and had stints as a player with Stoke City, Hull City, Cardiff City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he was until recently employed as a loan manager. The 40-year-old becomes the latest African to hold the technical director position in Europe after compatriot Michael Emenalo held similar roles at English side Chelsea and French club Monaco. “I am delighted to be part of a historic club like Grasshopper,” Olofinjana was quoted on the club’s official website. “I hope we can re-establish Grasshopper at the top of the Super League together.” He added :”This is an important role and I look forward to working together with the amazing people at Grasshopper to hopefully steer this massive club in the right direction. “A club as decorated and influential as Grasshopper deserves stability and we need to find the right ways of restoring its lost football glory.”
