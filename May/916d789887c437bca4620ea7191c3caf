A member of the House of Representatives, Mike Etaba, has decamped from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Etaba, from Cross River State, said his decision was informed by the defection of Governor Ben Ayade from the PDP to the APC. He officially registered for the APC in his political ward, Apiapum, in Obubra local government area of the state at the weekend. Etaba represents Obubra/Etung Federal Constituency. The lawmaker described himself as Ayade’s foot soldier for all seasons, who will continue to stand with the Governor beyond 2023. He said the Governor will continue to play politics with ethics devoid of violence. Etaba described the decision of Ayade to align with the centre as a smart choice for the benefit of the people of the state. It is speculated that at least one more member from the state would also join the APC in the coming days.
