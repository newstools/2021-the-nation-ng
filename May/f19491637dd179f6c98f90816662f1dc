One of the leaders of Gberigbe Orelade in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State, Chief Gbenga Daraloun Mayan is seeking Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s help to save the community from persistent cultists’ attacks. Mayan also urged the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Usman Baba and the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Hakeem Odumosu to intervene in the crisis. No fewer than one person was feared dead, and five others suffered gunshot injuries in the community two weeks ago, following violence by suspected landgrabbers and cultists. Mayan, who spoke with journalists in Ikorodu, said the community is seeking government’s intervention to avoid bloodshed which may arise from usurpation of land. He said he had informed the Police which had done a lot of work but the cultist refused to yield. “Members of the cultists and the land-grabbers have been on a rampage in this community, selling land belonging to residents and attacking workers on construction sites; we have informed the Police authorities,” he said.
