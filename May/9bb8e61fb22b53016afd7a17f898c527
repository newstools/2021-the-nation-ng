Brendan Rodgers has urged Kelechi Iheanacho, Wilfred Ndidi and others in Leicester  City to create history ahead of tomorrow’s FA Cup final. The Foxes face Chelsea at Wembley in their first FA Cup final in 52 years and are yet to win the trophy. The club has lost their previous four finals, the last coming against Manchester City in 1969, and Rodgers knows the Foxes can leave a legacy. He said: “We have earned the right to be in the final and we will arrive with an opportunity to make our own history. We feel we’re in with a chance and if we can play to our level we have a great chance. “We have watched it (the Cup final) all through our lives, to be able to lead Leicester out for the first time in 50-odd years will be a real privilege for me. “These weeks you always have to stay calm. This is a game where you can create an incredible legacy, you write your own stories in these games. “We have exactly the same preparation (as other games). The consequence of the game is greater than others but you don’t need to magnify an FA Cup final to raise any levels of anxiety.” Jonny Evans faces a race against time to make the final having missed the last two games with a persistent heel problem. A crowd of 21,000 will be at Wembley with Chelsea and Leicester allocated 6,250 tickets each as part of the pilot to test the return of big crowds to venues amid the coronavirus pandemic. Rodgers added: ‘Just to know in such a special occasion we are going to have people there with our backs and looking after us (is great). “Wembley is an iconic stadium so for them to watch the team play in a final will be really special for them.”
