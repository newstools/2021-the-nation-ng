The hoodlums who stormed the facility between 1and 2 am also set ablaze the Atta Magistrate and High Courts and vandalized the community’s health Centre, respectively. According to some community leaders, the burning of the police station and courts took place between 1 and 2 am. Community sources told our correspondent that the hoodlums who were armed shot sporadically for close to an hour before burning the Government-owned facilities in the community. A Prince of the community, Remigiius Azike, said that the incident took place when the villagers had gone to bed. A former president-general of the community, John Agbaso, who confirmed the incident also said that the community was in pain over the development. He said “it was just one week ago that the house of the president-general of the community, Chijioke Duruonyeokwu, was set ablaze by unknown people with his wife killed. He called on Government to come to their rescue, adding that Insecurity was on the increase in the area. “I was the one who built the police station and the magistrate Court and mobilised youths under the auspices of Transformations Ambassadors of Atta Nwambieri to build the High Court. I did this so that our people would have access to Government facilities. This is just one week they razed the house of our president General and killed his wife. The Government should come to our rescue,” he added. When contacted, the police public relations officer in the state, Bala Elkana, did not pick several calls and text messages sent to him.
