Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai has declared Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) leaders who coordinated the shutdown of the state in protest over mass sack of workers as bandits. He vowed they will be prosecuted, accusing them of unwanton destruction of public properties and disruption of peace. Their actions, according to the Governor, were equivalent to the actions of bandits terrorising the state. He also ordered the sack of all nurses in the state below Grade Level 14 and lecturers of the Kaduna State University (KASU) for joining the five-day warning strike.
