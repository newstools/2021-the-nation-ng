A member of the House of Representatives, James Abiodun Faleke, yesterday debunked rumours that Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has a list of his anointed aspirants for the All Progressives Congress (APC) primaries at the Ikeja Federal Constituency. He said anxious APC members had been calling him to enquire about the claim, but that knowing Mr. Sanwo-Olu’s integrity, he advised them to disregard it. The APC Lagos State chapter on May 3, released guidelines for aspirants contesting on its platform for the chairmanship, vice chairmanship, and councillorship tickets in the July 24, 2021 Local Government Area Election. Addressing the matter in a statement yesterday, Faleke said: “I have received calls and messages from most of our APC members from Ikeja Federal Constituency to ‘confirm if it is true that our governor has written a list of some aspirants as his anointed candidates?’ “I want to put on record all I have told those who called me that Governor Sanwo Olu is the governor for all and has no special or anointed candidates within our Ikeja Federal Constituency or the state. All party members are for him.” “Please disregard any pressure from anyone using his name or sending any list to all of you in the constituency. “The leadership of the party in the state has told all that we will be going for primaries. “I advise all to go about their ambitions in a very peaceful manner, as Ikeja is not known for violence. Thanks and God bless you all.”
