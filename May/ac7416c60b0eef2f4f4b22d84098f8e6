 The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) said it has taken all necessary measures to mitigate flooding across the state. It said the government has embarked on vigorous early warning campaigns in flood-prone areas, engaged in clearing drainage and water channels, went round to check defective buildings or those built on water channels, trained local emergency responders on easy evacuation of flood victims and ensured its relief camps are in good shape to take in persons displaced by flood, should it happen. Director General Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu gave the assurances during the ongoing retreat for 50 workers of the agency. He said LASEMA is pleased with the mechanisms put in place and the feedback from the public, adding that when compared to what happened in 2010, 2012 and 2017, the early warning strategies put in place this year have been efficient and effective.  “Our first responders are on the ground. You can see that the Lagos State Ministry of Environment are clearing the drainages and ensuring that they are carrying sensitisation. There have been some form of enforcement and the building controlling agencies have been going about to ensure that collapsed building is greatly reduced and that people do not build to obstruct canals,” he said. “Also, there is a clear feedback between the government and the people of Lagos state. We meet at our emergency numbers, they call us, they text us and our response has not only been effective, it has been efficient so with that we are well prepared for any eventuality concerning flood.” “We have started carrying out simulation exercises to be able to evacuate victims of flood emergency as quickly as possible should that occur. Where we are going to keep them, if the need arises, is ready. The camps have been put on red alert.”
