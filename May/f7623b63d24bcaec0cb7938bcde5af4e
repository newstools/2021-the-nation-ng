All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu said yesterday that he has no anointed candidate for the local government elections holding in Lagos State in July. “Don’t use my name as a cover,” he told the people he described as name pushers and agents of falsehood. Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State, spoke about the antics of electoral speculators fuelling the rumours about imaginable anointed candidates, shortly after the meeting of Southwest APC leaders at the State House, Marina. He said he has not asked aspirants to either withdraw from the race or refrain from contesting for offices. No fewer than 1,200 aspirants, who had indicated their interests in the councillorship and chairmanship elections, are being screened by a panel chaired by Prof. Durosinmi-Etti. The complaints arising from the screening are expected to be resolved by the Appeal Committee headed by former Deputy Governor Olufemi Pedro. The primary election holds on Saturday, according to the guidelines released by the party Chairman, Alhaji Tunde Balogun. Tinubu said every Lagosian has the right to participate in the local government poll as registered party members. “Nobody is my favourite candidate,” he maintained, urging party members to disregard the antics of rumour peddlers. The party leader also explained his position on consensus option, which he said can be adopted, based on mutual consent of stakeholders. He said: “I encourage consensus. But, the consensus candidature must be ratified at the grassroots by the party members. I have not endorsed or proclaimed anybody as my candidate.” Tinubu emphasised that all contestants must come with the party guidelines. He warned name droppers and troublemakers to stay away from the grassroots electioneering. He said: “We want to celebrate and promote democracy as it is being done all over the world with civility and respect.”
