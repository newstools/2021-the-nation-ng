Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has praised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for putting his faith in youngsters at Old Trafford and getting the results. In an interview with the BBC on Thursday, the Scot spoke also of his pride in United striker Marcus Rashford’s campaign for free school meals and explained why he opposed plans for a closed European Super League.  The 79-year-old, one of the greatest managers of all time, was in charge when Solskjaer played for United and recalled how even then the Norwegian was taking notes for the future. “He had a will that he wanted to be a manager, and at a club like Manchester United, it’s a result industry, without question,” he said of the Norwegian who replaced Jose Mourinho as manager in 2018. If you don’t get results there’s questions to be asked. He is getting the results, he really has done very well.”
