Commercial activities in Akure, the Ondo State capital, were yesterday grounded as hundreds of persons trooped out to join the Ilana Omo Oodua rally. Ilana Omo Oodua, a group agitating for a sovereign Yoruba nation stormed Akure in continuation of its support rally in all the Southwest States. Vehicular traffic was diverted from the busy Oba Adeshida. Some traders packed up their wares and closed their shops to avoid hoodlums from looting their goods in case the rally turned violent. The rally moved from the Isikan Roundabout to the Oba Adeshida road before proceeding to the Deji of Akure’s palace where Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo known as Sunday Igboho, addressed Oba Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi. Igboho said there was no going back on the demand for a Yoruba nation and reiterated his stand that there would be no election in the South-West states in 2023. He called on all Yoruba people to be united and stopped being slaves to the northerners. He said, “We are in Akure to demand for Yoruba Nation and now is the time for the actualization of Yoruba nation of our dream and we are ready to employ all peaceful means to achieve this. “We are here to receive your blessing and support and we can assure you that with you on our side, all our dreams will come to reality, we stand for the peaceful dissolution of Nigeria and any violent person during our rallies is a mole planted among us. Deji of Akure who was represented y the Edemo of Akure, High Chief Afolabi Fayehun, urged Adeyemo and his followers to be focused and avoid violence.
