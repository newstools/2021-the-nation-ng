Singer, songwriter and rapper Divine Ikubor aka Rema has officially given a peculiar name to his genre of music. The Jonzing World (Marvin Records Label) signee recently made this announcement on social media in a chat on Capital Xtra. Social media users have at different points mockingly referred to his kind of music as Indian music. In the course of discussing with the host, the “Bounce” crooner revealed that people say his music is like that of the Indian’s and even Arabian’s in a bid to get to him however, it doesn’t. He went further to state that he has decided to use their “bad comment” to his own advantage. Thus, his decision to globalize and take Afrobeat to the next level by naming his music “Afrorave” adding that his album “Bounce” seals his claim. Rema added that Afrorave is a sub-genre of Afrobeat. The super-talented songster also noted that he hopes the next generation can take Afrorave to the next level just like he has done. The “Iron Man” singer shared the video of the chat session on his Instagram page with an accompanying caption that read; “From this day my sound will be called “Afrorave” a sub-genre of Afrobeat, my Album seals this claim for good.”
