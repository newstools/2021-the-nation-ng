Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi has dissolved all boards and commissions in the state with immediate effect. He announced this during his 2021 anniversary day address to the people of the state. Also sacked are management Committee members, liaison officers and local government advisory committee at all the 64 local government areas and 171 wards in the state. Also affected by the sack are all the Executive Assistants, Technical Assistants and Senior Technical Assistants to the governor. Put together, those sacked are over 1000. The sack comes barely 24 hours after the governor sacked 83 members of the state executive council. He however noted that some statutory boards are not affected by the dissolution. They include Judiciary Service Commission, House of Assembly Service Commission, Civil Service Commission, Local Government Service Commission and Ebonyi State Independent Electoral Commission (EBSIEC). The governor said the sack became necessary because some of the appointees have sympathy for the opposition Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party(PDP). He also stated that the sack is to enable those who want to contest the local government elections next year and the All Progressive Congress(APC) congress to take part in the elections.
