Super Falcons‘ American Coach Randy Waldrum  said  the Nigerian ladies know how to handle the Black Queens after both West African soccer powers were drawn for the first round qualifiers for the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations(AWCON). “Obviously, this is a difficult draw, we have a lot of respect for Ghana, and we know the strength and power of that team. But as far as the pressure of the job and the task at hand, I think that’s something that any competitor truly embraces, and you know I think the biggest thing for me is that I’m just ready to get to work,” the former Trinidad & Tobago  coach said. On his possible strategy to humble the Ghanaian side, Waldrum said: “Well, I think, right now, I’ve got to do a little more homework, because obviously being from the US, I’m a little bit newer to all the African nations but I know the history. I know several of the results over the years against Ghana and I understand, as I mentioned earlier, the strength of this team, so we have a lot of respect for them. I think the biggest thing for me right now is worrying about our team and putting together our plan the way we want to play.” “And again, that takes some time and that’s what we’ve been working on this year as we’ve gotten together, and we’ve got a few more international matches coming up in June and September so we’re looking forward to that. I think right now, the focus is more on preparing our team properly and as we get closer than we will start to prepare a little bit more for Ghana,” he added. The former USA U-23 handler believes the pedigree of Nigeria at global level would be an advantage for the team.
