The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has disclosed the telecommunications sector has reached an all-time high with 154 million internet subscriptions across the country. Its Executive Vice Chairman/CEO, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, noted that 87 million broadband subscriptions representing 45.93 broadband penetrations have been achieved as at the first quarter of 2021. According to Danbatta, over 207 million voice subscriptions with teledensity standing at 108.94 percent have been attained in the industry. Danbatta spoke while receiving a delegation from Autoridade Reguladora Nacional (ARN), the Telecom National Regulatory Authority of Guinea-Bissau at the Headquarters of the Commission in Abuja. The NCC boss said through the implementation of various policy initiatives, particularly the National Broadband Plan (2020-2025), there had been improved access to broadband for over 80 million Nigerians and targets the provision of Point of Broadband Access (PoA) in all the 774 local government areas (LGAs) of the country within the plan period. Danbatta stated that challenges remain in the process but observed that NCC is committed to addressing such challenges as Right of Way (RoW) issue, multiple taxation, vandalism of telecom infrastructure, among others, confronting the licensees as they roll out services. He said: “We identified 217 clusters of access gaps and today, we have ensured more Nigerians are digitally-included by reducing the number of access gaps to 114 currently, while more measures are being taken to further reduce the access gaps, thereby deepening digital inclusion. “Nigeria’s telecoms sector had reached an all-time-high, basic internet subscription of 154 million; over 87 million broadband subscriptions, representing 45.93 per cent broadband penetration; over 207 million voice subscriptions with teledensity standing at 108.94 per cent as at October, 2020.”
