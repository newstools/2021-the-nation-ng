It’s fresh with a new sound. It was released on May 28, 2021,” he said. Continuing he said, “My kind of Kalakuta music is refined, different, and reincarnated. My sound sets me apart from other young talents because I play Afro (Kalakuta). Nobody does it better.” On the inspiration behind the song, the ‘You Say Wetin’ singer revealed that drugs or alcohol does not inspire him as he relies on life experience for inspiration. “I get my inspiration from different things. It could be friends, family, or real-life situations. Life has taught me loads of lessons but one important one is that a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory. “Apart from that, my drive keeps me going. Knowing too well that nothing lasts forever is a major driver here. So I think of a solution and keep moving and my team is a whole motivation for me.”
