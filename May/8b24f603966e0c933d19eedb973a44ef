Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr says that the Super Eagles friendly with Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions will serve as an ideal fixture to keep the team in shape following the postponement of the first and second match days of the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The continental arch-rivals will face each other in an international friendly at the Wiener Neustadt Stadium in Vienna, Austria next week. “This friendly against Cameroon is an interesting game because we are going to have some of the new players, since some of our regular players will not be available due to injuries, and it is not easy to have everybody at this period because it is also the offseason period,” Rohr told CAFOnline.com. “It is a big test game and an opportunity to test the new players,” added the German coach. Nigeria has not lost to the Lions under Rohr, a 4-0 win at home in Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and had a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture in Yaounde. The last time both teams met ended in a 3-2 win for the Eagles in the second round of the 2019 AFCON in Egypt in 2019. “Of course, we are not going to play for the result against Cameroon in Austria, but it is an opportunity to see our boys and see something different with our systems against a very good team that will host the next AFCON,” Rohr added.
