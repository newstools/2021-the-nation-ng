Davido has gifted his daughter, Aurora Imade Adeleke a brand new Range Rover in anticipation of her 6th birthday. Imade Adeleke is the first offspring of the DMW boss whom he shares with his first baby mama, Sophia Momodu. Imade will officially clock 6 on May 14 but the super dad, Davido decides to send in an early present. Even though the 30BG boss isn’t in the country as he was seen jetting out few days ago, he still found a way to pull up some extraordinary stunt and quite extravagant too. The super star “Fem” crooner whom Twitter officially launched an emoji for his “E Choke” sign took to his Instagram page to share a video of Imade and friends in her new ride as the daughter sat on the driver’s side and fondled with the steering. And finally, a photo of just the car. The doting father of three captioned post; “Happy early BIRTHDAY BABY @realimadeadeleke daddy loves you!! Enjoy your MOTO.” Fans and celebrities alike have taken to the comment section to hail Davido for being an awesome dad, one who go to the ends of the earth to make his kids happy. While others have prayed for him. thedorathybachor stated: “Father of the year.” lifeofrona01 wrote: “God Job Daddy!!!” exquisitesouvenirs said: “David be setting the pace.” zubbymichael tweeted: “Over choke.” focalistic wrote: “She was moving the car.” sirbanko wrote: “Big Daddy Baddest!” omar_focuz wrote: “@Davido Egbon you no just gree!” dewolafromisaleeko wrote: “Ain’t no badder Daddy.” scoobynero said: “Wow!
