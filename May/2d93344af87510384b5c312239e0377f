The Federal Government has approved June 30 as new deadline for the National Identity Numbers (NIN) linkage with the Subscribers Identity Module (SIM) cards. The government also said so far 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NIN, translating to over 190 million mobile numbers. The government’s decision was contained in a statement jointly signed by the Director of Public Affairs of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) Dr Ikechukwu Adinde and Head of Corporate Communications of the National Identity Management Commission(NIMC) Mr Kayode Adegoke. The statement reads: “The postponement of the deadline was also based on the request by stakeholders for an extension till 30th of June in order to make it easier for all citizens and legal residents to register. “Significant progress has been made in the NIN-SIM verification process. For example, almost 54 Million people have obtained their NIN and this can translate to up to 190 million mobile numbers, since empirical evidence suggests that each unique NIN maps to 3 to 4 phone lines. “The much awaited Android enrolment system is now ready for deployment and this has the potential to significantly accelerate the speed and ease of enrolments. “Furthermore, the telecom providers and other enrolment agents have also opened several centres across the country to make it easier for eligible citizens and residents to obtain and link their NINs. “It is noteworthy that Sections 27 and 29 of the National Identity Management Commission Act 2007 provides for the mandatory use of National Identity Number for accessing several government services. “This is similar to the use of Social Security Number and National Insurance Number for accessing services in the United States of America and the United Kingdom respectively. “The Federal Government has approved the extension as part of its effort to make it easier for its citizens and residents to obtain the NIN and it is important to take advantage of the extension.”
