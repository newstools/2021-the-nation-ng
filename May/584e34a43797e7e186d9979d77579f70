The Federal Government has denied returning £4.2 million loot recovered from former Governor James Ibori to Delta Government. A statement from the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) on Wednesday said: “The money is still being awaited after which the issues around it will be resolved before further action is taken. For now, no money has been returned to Delta State”. The statement signed by Henshaw Ogubike, Director (Information, Press and Public Relations) explained: “The issue of the £4.2million Ibori loot has not been properly resolved”. Regarding the Accountant General’s statement to the National Assembly on Tuesday the loot has been returned to the Delta government, Henshaw Ogubike said: “The AGF was only making general comments about recoveries relating to State Governments”.
