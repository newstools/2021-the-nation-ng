President Muhammadu Buhari has approved new security measures for the Southeast and South-South regions of the country. This was one of the outcomes of the series of security meetings held in the last eleven days and concluded on Tuesday in the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, disclosed this to State House Correspondents after the meeting. He, however, declined to give details. The president also approved a memo presented by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), on the control of drugs, which he said are enablers of Insecurity, but did not also elaborate. The NSA said the meeting stressed the need to address the security challenges in the country particularly those that have arisen in the last few months.
