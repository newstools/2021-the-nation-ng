The Federal Government will soon reconstitute the Special Terrorism Prosecution Courts to try the recently arrested 400 suspected Boko Haram financiers and other terror suspects, Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has said. Malami said the move was part of the many measures to address insurgency and growing insecurity. The FG had in the past deployed similar arrangement to prosecute Boko Haram suspects detained in Kainji (Niger State), Maiduguri (Borno State), among others. In a statement on Thursday, the AGF’s spokesman, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, quoted him as assuring the Federal Government was committed to ending insecurity. He said in addition to prosecution of 400 suspected Boko Haram financiers, the government has taken more measures to counter the twin trouble of insurgency and insecurity. Malami said very soon, the Federal Government will, through the Federal Ministry of Justice’s Complex Case Group, resuscitate and reinvigorate the existing special terrorism prosecution courts in the country in order bring to book all those found guilty so as to serve as deterrence to others. While felicitating with Muslims faithful on the occasion of this year’s Eid al-fitr, Malami noted that Ramadan fast comes with numerous lessons including sincerity, honesty, commitment, sacrifice, selflessness, introspection and empathy, among others. Malami urged Muslims, as they celebrate Eid-fitr, to continue to be law-abiding, have sober reflection and exhibit the imbibed lessons learnt during the period of Ramadan fast. He hailed the commitment of clerics in enlightening their followers on various issues during the months urging them to maintain the tempo even beyond the period of Ramadan.
