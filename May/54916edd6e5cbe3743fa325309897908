The police and community leaders of Ile-Ife and Modakeke have denied a report that there was a fresh crisis between the two communities early yesterday. Spokesperson for the police command Yemisi Opalola said in a statement: “I want to state that it was an erroneous belief that some people came to attack people at Famia axis. The news was fake and a blatant lie. “The vigilance group guiding the area against thieves and hoodlums were on their routine show of force, to alert the people of the community of their presence and assure them of safety. But because of what happened recently, people became afraid, thinking they were under attack.” Spokesman for Modakeke Progressive Union (MPU), Ven. Debo Babalola, said: “Robbers went to Alaro in Modakeke and shot into the air thrice. This caused panic among Ile-Ife and Modakeke residents living at the place. We have to come out and calm our people down that it was armed robbers. I called Obalufe and others, they confirmed that there was peace in Ile-Ife. Alaro links Ajebandele new site and Ooni Resource Centre. There is peace in the land.” Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has sent delegates to the communities to assure residents that there is no crisis. The Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mr. Tajudeen Lawal and the Special Adviser to the Governor on Innovations, Ismaheel Akande, led the delegates.
