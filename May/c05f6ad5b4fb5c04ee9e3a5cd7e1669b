The Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities, Bayelsa State chapter, has protested the alleged discrimination and suspension of its member by the management of the Niger Delta University, Ammasoma. The group, in their large numbers, on Friday, stormed the Bayelsa State Government House, Yenagoa, to ventilate their grievances over the alleged ill-treatment meted out to their member, one Mr Numuworimi Yeitaribo, because of his disability. The state Chairman of JNAPWD, Mr Ikilowei Eric, said they were in Government House to present a protest letter over the NDU’s “inhuman and misguided action.” Eric said the criterion used in selecting the new Bursar of the university did not only deprive Yeitaribo, who until his suspension was the Deputy Bursar, but also contravened the Discrimination Against Persons With Disabilities (Prohibition) Act of 2018. He appealed to Governor Douye Diri to prevail on the management of the NDU to lift Yeitaribo’s suspension and conduct a fresh independent interview for the position of the new Bursar, among other requests.
