Aviation workers under the aegis of the National Union Of Air Transport Employees (NUATE), Association Of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP) and National Association Of Aircraft Pilots And Engineers (NAAPE), will on Sunday, from midnight, shut down operations at Kaduna airport over a strike declared by the Nigeria Labour and Congress (NLC). The unions accused the State government of anti-labour practices perpetrated against civil servants by the Governor Nasir El-Rufai-led administration in the state. In two separate letters jointly signed by the union’s leaders, namely Ocheme Aba, General secretary, NUATE, Abdulrasak Saidu, Secretary-General, ANAP and Ofonime Umoh , Deputy General Secretary, NAAPE, the workers said they will comply with the directive of NLC to down tools in the state between May 16 and 21, 2021, adding that all workers have been directed to withdraw all services at the airport within the stipulated period. “In effect, there will be no operations of any kind into, at, or out of the airport within the period. ” This information is provided to enable your management to take steps to safeguard valuable property within the airport vicinity during the period of the industrial action. “This action shall be fully carried out unless otherwise directed by the NLC. And all workers are enjoined to fully comply as no form of sabotage shall be tolerated,” the unions said
