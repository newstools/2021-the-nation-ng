Music executive and Mavin Records boss, Don Jazzy has declared award-winning singer, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun aka Wizkid as African artiste of the decade. Canadian rapper/singer Drake was on Sunday, May 23, 2021, awarded “Artist of the Decade” at the just concluded 2021 “Billboard Music Awards.” The rapper’s three-year-old son, Adonis, joined him to receive on stage. Drizzy’s massive achievement has set social media buzzing with fans and lovers of good music seeking for such award in Africa while listing possible artistes to clinch it. Amid this, popular television personality Adesope Olajide asked social media users to nominate their African Artist of the Decade if the Billboard Award was to give out such an award. One of the people who gave their opinion was Singer Samklef. He wrote; “Star boy.” However, one comment that stood out and has left social media users quite surprised is Don Jazzy’s. The Mavin boss who is well known for his bold stance on airing his views on any subject matter commented under the post and wrote; “Wiz.” This has emboldened and led a good number of social media users to say the “Ojuelegba” crooner is deserving of the “African Artist of the Decade.”
