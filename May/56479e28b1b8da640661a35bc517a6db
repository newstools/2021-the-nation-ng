The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Imo has arrested six suspected members of a syndicate that allegedly specialised in pipeline vandalism and oil theft. The state NSCDC Commandant, Mr Michael Ogar, said this on Wednesday during an interactive session with newsmen in Owerri. Ogar said the command made the arrest following a “serious information gathering and substantiated intelligence”. He also said four trucks ladened with petroleum products and eleven smaller vehicles were intercepted and impounded during the operation. “We acted on intelligence. We took our time, cordoned off the area and apprehended six suspects,” he said. The NSCDC chief further said the command would not relent in the efforts to rid the state of bunkering. “Vandals should pack and leave Imo because there will be no safe place for them here. We will not let them destroy the state. “This is just the beginning. Soon, other areas outside the capital city will know we are on ground and that we mean business,” Ogar said. He called on residents to always avail the command of useful information on the whereabouts of vandals. (NAN)
