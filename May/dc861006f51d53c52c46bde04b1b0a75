The Lagos State Butchers Association Chairman, Bamidele Alabi, yesterday responded to the allegation that he mismanaged the association’s N288,486,630. Alabi denied the charge, describing it as false because, according to him, the association never had such amount in its coffers, let alone for someone to embezzle it. He was reacting to the allegation contained in a petition to the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) by some of the association’s members, including Adeyinka Rasheed, Mukaila Agunbiade, Adeyemo Lukman. The petitioners also claimed that the association’s constitution permits only two tenures which had been completed by Alabi. Warning that any attempt for a third tenure could degenerate into chaos, they called for the IGP’s urgent intervention to forestall any outbreak of lawlessness that might arise from aggrieved members. But responding, Alabi said lies were being fabricated against him by those afraid of his popularity. He said: “My bid to contest for the same chairmanship position in our forthcoming election is accommodated within the ambit of the association’s constitution in Section 24 cap 3&4. “Butchers Association has a transparent accounting system that dictates the allocation of members’ funds based on different butchers’ settlement… “Our association is not buoyant, as they alleged, that someone would have stolen N300million without any notice, a move I know is political due to association’s election preparations.” “All of these allegations and several other moves my detractors are employing are because they are too afraid of my popularity among my people across Lagos and they are just aiming at anything to bring me down at all cost.”
