A 400 Level student of Plateau State University (PLASU), Bokkos, reportedly kidnapped by four gunmen on Thursday night has been rescued by security operatives. The University’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof Yohana Izam, who confirmed the kidnap and rescue of the student in a telephone interview with the Nation on Saturday, praised the security operatives over the eventual release of the student. “As an institution, we are grateful for the return of our missing student, safe and unhurt. “Our earlier caution to our students to minimize late evening and night shuttles particularly off-campus is still relevant as the University axis from Bokkos through Diram and Ndar has been infiltrated by merchants of crime who cash in on the vulnerability of the largely defenceless students population,” Izam lamented.
