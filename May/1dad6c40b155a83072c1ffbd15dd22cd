The Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) has restored electricity in many parts of Kaduna metropolis. The workers cut off power supply to the entire state on Sunday to kick start the five-day warning strike over the sack of 4,000 workers by government. But the strike was called off on Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Government invited Organised Labour and Kaduna Government to a meeting on Thursday to resolve the issue in Abuja. As at 10:30pm, electricity was restored in many parts of Kaduna metropolis. As the time of filing this report, there was power supply in Badiko, Gwamna road, part of Kurmi Mashi and Kabala Costain. But areas like Barnawa, Millennium City, Sabo GRA and major parts of the Kaduna city centre were still in darkness. Kaduna Electric spokesman confirmed restoration of power supply. He said any part of the city without electricity was possibly suffering from one local fault or the other.
