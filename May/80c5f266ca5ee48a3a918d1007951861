Lagos State Government has paid N38million as crop compensation to 16 traditional land-owning families in Igbodu, Epe. The state acquired the land for agricultural activities. Commissioner for Agriculture Ms Bisola Olusanya presented cheques to the beneficiaries at the weekend. Some of the beneficiaries were the Eredo, Oponla Yeleru, Ojamo, Ilewu Ale, Oreta, Sharoye, Isiba Kaiye, Koleledoye families. She said the government had acquired about 500 hectares since 1985 for agricultural purposes in Molajoye, Aleke and Igbodu areas of Epe. According to Olusanya, the government has so far paid about N40 million as compensations to the 16 families whose lands were donated and acquired for the state’s agricultural activities. She said: “The programme is part of our strategies, together with the five-point agenda that was launched recently, towards acquiring land for the agricultural estate, which will bring development to the areas. “Negotiation with the families is not about the monetary aspect alone because what we are doing by acquiring the land for agricultural purposes is one of the ways of bringing jobs to that area. It is also part of our strategies, along with the five-point agenda that was launched recently, towards acquiring land for agricultural estate development.”
