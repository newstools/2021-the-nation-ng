Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has received a report of the committee that investigated the unlawful salary payment to 48 disengaged sunset teachers for March. He said actions would be taken against anyone implicated in the heist. The governor has set up a three-person committee to probe revelations that some of the teachers, who were disengaged last December, were paid in March. The panel comprised Mr. Saka Razaq (chairman), Mr. Murtala Sambo and Mrs. Adenike Ojo. Speaking at the submission of the committee’s report, AbdulRazaq said the “integrity of the payroll of the state government is very important to us. A situation where people will upload names that are not supposed to be on the payroll will not be tolerated by the government. That’s why we set up the committee to look into it, find the culprits and recommend solution. “Let me appreciate your work. It is straight, fast and voluminous. Government will look into it and take action.” Razaq said the committee was inaugurated on April 30 to consider the circumstances surrounding the infiltration of 48 disengaged SUBEB sunset workers into the March payroll. “We invited the departments involved (their heads and members). We asked them to put their defence in writing and we invited them for oral cross examination and presentation,” he said. “In our cross examination, we examined them based on the document submitted. We even engaged forensic experts in order to detect some things. We have come up with our findings and recommendations.” The committee’s report confirmed the unlawful inclusion of 48 names of sunset teachers into the March payroll and recommended that queries be issued to some officers involved in the preparation of the payroll, a rejig of the Office of Accountant General and refund of the amount involved by the consultant that paid the money, while government takes steps to avoid a repeat of the ugly development.
