 A final-YEAR student of Delta State University, Abraka, and an unidentified okada rider have been crushed to death by a cement-laden truck. It was learnt that the incident occurred on Tuesday, as the truck tried to avoid a motorcyclist and another vehicle on the ever-busy Police Station Road in Abraka. The truck was said to have skidded off the road and crushed the two persons as it fell. The student was reportedly a First Class student of the Department of Economics.  “How can this happen? Today is supposed to be his mother’s birthday. Who will disclose this bad news to his mother now,” one Matthew, said to be a friend of the deceased, cried. A video of the scene saw Maduka’s body partly trapped under the trailer, and a man lying on a side of the road, while sympathisers made frantic efforts to rescue any other victim by unloading the cement truck. The truck driver ran away after the accident, while the conductor was nearly lynched before police rescued him. Police spokesman Edafe Bright confirmed the incident to The Nation  yesterday. “I have two casualties for now. I don’t know if they have discovered another one. I know the conductor was rescued from being mobbed and is currently in our custody,” Bright said.
