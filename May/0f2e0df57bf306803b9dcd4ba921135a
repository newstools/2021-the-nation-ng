Mixed reactions have followed the selection of Beyonce, one of the final 11 contestants of the Nigerian Idol. After two weeks of auditioning, the judges have drawn a curtain of the theatre week for Nigerian Idol Season 6 as they selected the best 11 contestants who will be competing to be Nigeria’s next biggest singing sensation. Contestants were appraised on the depth of their voice and stage performance.  Many viewer’s favourites were evicted by the judges, chaired by DJ Sose, Seyi Shay, and Obi Asika. Fortunately, 16-year-old Beyonce Ajomiwe made the final 11 after her last performance was rewarded with a spot by the judges.Fans and critics of the show took to social media to criticise the selection of the fair-skinned Beyonce. Comments from social media see the audience of the show drifting into two factions over Beyonce’s ability to deliver a breathtaking performance. While some feel her voice isn’t strong enough, others feel she’s a dynamite waiting to explode on the Nigerian music scene.
