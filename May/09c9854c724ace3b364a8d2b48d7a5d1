The Northern States Governorâ€™s Forum says it has uncovered a clandestine attempt by a shadow group to engage in a smear campaign against the forum as well as its chairman and governor of Plateau State, Rt. Hon. Simon Bako Lalong. The forum expressed disgust over campaign of calumny in which the group has gone, to the extent of printing and circulating posters to the effect that it is supporting the Minister of Communication Technology and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami over some statements he is said to have made in the past. The uncovered plan shows that those behind the propaganda publication are political interests that are bent on dragging the forum into the controversy by widely circulating the posters on social media and pasting same across the country with a view to tarnishing the image of the body and its members. For the avoidance of doubt, the forum wishes to state that it has no intention of being dragged into the matter, as the minister has provided his response to the issue which does not need the validation or denial of the forum. According to a statement by spokesman to the governor, Dr. Makut Simon Macham, members of the public are advised to beware of the antics of such sponsored mischief makers and should therefore disregard such propaganda posters, which only intend to serve the selfish interests of those behind them.
