The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it has created additional 924 polling units across the 18 local government areas of Ondo State. This, it said, would increase the polling units in the states to 3,933. It said the increased polling units would be available for 1,822,346 voting population. Ondo Residents Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Rufus Akeju, stated these at a stakeholders meeting for the implementation of the expansion of voter access to polling units in Nigeria. He explained the commission arrived at the figure by converting existing Voting Points that meets the minimum threshold of 750 or maximum 1000 voters per polling units. Akeju said the polling points were created ahead of the 2015 general elections to help decongest large polling units. He said the Commission was being bombarded with letters from voters complaining of being disenfranchised because polling units were far from their settlements. The Ondo REC attributed the progressives declined in voters turnout in the last four electoral cycles was to the apathy from voters who would have trekked long distance to access their polling units. According to him: “The results from the field works is currently undergoing verification and the new polling units in their locations will be reflected in the forthcoming Continuous Voter Registration exercise. “We have been receiving letter for the past 25 years for inadequacies of polling units. People trek long distances and some are afraid of likely electoral violence.”
