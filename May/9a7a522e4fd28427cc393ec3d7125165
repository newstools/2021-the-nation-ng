Popular Nollywood actress, Bimbo Ademoye, has cautioned filmmakers to stop disrespecting cinemas as not all movies produced by filmmakers are worthy of being shown on the big screen The talented actress revealed not every movie was worthy of being shown in cinemas. She said: “I am a perfectionist. I am the type of person that can make a movie worth millions and would still think it is not cinema-worthy. “I am not one to decide what film makes it to the cinema but I can tell you films that should not make it to the cinemas. Don’t disrespect that space.” Ademoye said the fact that a movie is produced on big budget does not mean it must end in a cinema. She added, “Don’t say because you have cameras and actors, you just take it and let people waste their money, time and energy at the cinemas. “Some movies are better watched at home. That is being greedy. At the end of the day, the filmmakers end up stressing themselves because Nigerians know what is good. They would not tell people to go and watch a movie that is not good.” When asked if she had ever been disappointed at not winning an award, Ademoye said, “Of course, I am human. I had anticipated winning an award twice. But, has that stopped me? Absolutely not! Would I keep working harder? Absolutely yes.” The 30-year-old actress also noted that getting nominated for the Eko Star Film and TV Awards was huge. She added that she did not consider it a nomination but a recognition.
