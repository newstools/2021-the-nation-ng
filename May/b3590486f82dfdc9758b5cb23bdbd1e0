The Nigerian international struggled in his first year in Belgium but won the hearts of many after delivering numerous excellent performances Paul Onuachu has admitted that the Belgian First Division A is a challenging championship, but the determination to push himself beyond the limit helped him become the best in the country. Onuachu was voted by his peers as the Pro Footballer of the Year, adding the award to the top goal scorer award for finding the back of the net 33 times in 38 league matches for KRC Genk. The 26-year-old only managed nine goals in 22 matches in his maiden campaign last season after completing his switch from Danish side FC Midtjylland. But his turnaround in fortunes, 12 months later, has been evident for all to see. Onuachu is clear about how he was able to improve his efficiency in front of goal. “This award means a lot to me because the Belgian championship is a very difficult competition,” the Genk forward told Eleven Sports as per Walfoot. “I struggled a bit when I arrived here. At the start of the season, I said to myself that I had to push myself more and give more. “I am proud of myself and my team, and I am happy to have the support of my companion, who is always behind me.” In a related development, former Nigerian international Sunday Oliseh has applauded Onuachu for winning the Footballer of the Year and top scorer awards in Belgium. Oliseh is convinced that Onuachu is deserving of the awards and has branded the 24-year-old as one of the best strikers in Nigeria and Africa. “At the moment, Paul Onuachu is arguably Nigeria’s and one Of Africa’s most prolific strikers in the market. Fully deserved, and congrats Paul, ” the former Juventus midfielder noted via his Twitter account.
