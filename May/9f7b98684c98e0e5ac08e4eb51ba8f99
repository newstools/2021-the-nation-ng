Singer and winner of Project Fame West Africa 2010 Chidinma Ekile, who recently switched from secular to gospel music, was seen preaching in a beer parlour. The singer, who revealed her new status in a series of post on Instagram as she clocked 30, noted she is a “crusader of the gospel of Jesus” and has also released a single ‘Jehovah Overdo’ to mark her rebranding. The singer, who refers to self as Mummy GO, was seen in a recent video shared on her Instagram page preaching in Yoruba language to a group of young men who were drinking beer at a beer parlour. The end-time soldier, as she also refers to self, who recently disclosed that the devil had been winning for too long in her life but now she wants to use all of her talents to work for her father who is in heaven and ensure souls are won to His Kingdom is obviously living up to her vow with this recent video. The gospel singer captioned post: “Street Evangelism. The other day during our street evangelism….” Social media users have reacted to the video by applauding her courage and faith while also praying for grace to do even much more on her behalf. lizzyartstudio wrote: “God bless you for doing what some of us have failed to do.” llinasbeadsandaccessories said: “May God continue to lead you to bring more souls to him in the name of Jesus Christ.
