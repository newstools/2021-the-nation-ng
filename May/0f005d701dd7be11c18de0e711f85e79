 The singer reacted to Forbes’s recently released list of richest African musicians after he found himself at the 28th position. This didn’t sit well with the singer who is by far, one of the richest musicians to ever emerge from the African continent as he reportedly charges nothing less than $70, 000 per show internationally. Simba, as he is often referred, labelled the list a ‘stupid list’ of richest African musicians and advised Forbes to Google his name first to ascertain his true net worth before ranking him. The singer, who just entered into a partnership deal on Tuesday, May 18 with Warner Music South Africa, took to his Instagram page to state his displeasure. He shared series of photos he took at the Sandton, South Africa office of Warner Music. He captioned the post: “FORBES: next time google me to know what am really worth of, before putting me on your Stupid Richest African Musicians List!!!”
