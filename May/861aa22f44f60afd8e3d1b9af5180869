Pastor TB Joshua has condoled with Pastor Enoch Adeboye and the Redeemed Christian Church Of God (RCCG) over the sudden death of Pastor Dare Adeboye. The Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) founder also led his congregation in observing a moment of silence in honour of the memory of the deceased. “God does not need our permit; God’s time is the best,” Joshua stated in a live service broadcast on Friday, May 7, 2021, on Emmanuel TV. “It is not how long we live that matters but how well we live,” he continued in the short condolence message also uploaded to his social media accounts. “Pray that the Holy Spirit, our Comforter, will strengthen the family and the ministry. Let us observe a moment of silence in remembrance of Pastor Dare Adeboye,” Joshua concluded. RCCG announced that burial activities for Dare, the third son of Pastor Enoch Adeboye who passed away in his sleep on Wednesday, will commence tomorrow. TB Joshua and Adeboye are among Nigeria’s most well-known and influential pastors. However, Adeboye has publicly said in the past he would not worship in Joshua’s church.
