Ebonyi Governor David Umahi on Sunday ordered an investigation into the alleged attack and kidnap of his former aide, Amos Ogbonnaya. Ogbonnaya, who was the Coordinator of Anuagata Development Centre in Ohaozara local government area, was kidnapped and tortured last Thursday by suspected political thugs. He was freed on Friday by his abductors and currently hospitalised following injuries he sustained. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) have been accusing each other of masterminding the kidnap and torture. Umahi, who condemned the kidnap, ordered full investigation into the incident. The Governor, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze, said: “Having followed the trend of events including accusations and counter-accusations in some quarters, The Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Nweze Umahi, condemns the unsavory situation in strong terms knowing that such is unhealthy for collective democratic existence. “To this end, the Governor has directed the Police and other Security Agencies to swing into action by unearthing all perpetrators of the dastardly act to enable them to face justice as he equally wishes Mr. Amos Ogbonna a quick recovery.” He noted that he was committed to the security and safety of all citizens despite the political divides, adding a threat to one’s safety is a threat to the safety of all.
