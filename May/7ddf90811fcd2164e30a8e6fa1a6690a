Fred has been recalled by Brazil coach Tite for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay. The Manchester United midfielder has not featured for his country for around two-and-a-half years but will now look to add to the 11 caps he has won with the Selecao.  The 28-year-old, who has been a regular in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this term, played 45 minutes against Saudi Arabia in October 2018 before being an unused substitute in a 1-0 win over fierce rivals Argentina in the same month. Veteran full-back Dani Alves, now with Sao Paolo, is also back in the squad at the age of 38 while Benfica’s Lucas Verissimo has been granted a first call-up. However, there is no place for United full-back Alex Telles.
