Steven Gerrard and David Beckham have become the latest players to be inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame. The former England captains are the seventh and eighth players to be handed the honour, joining Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Eric Cantona, Roy Keane, Frank Lampard and Dennis Bergkamp. Gerrard spent 17 years at Liverpool – including 12 as captain – during which time he scored 120 goals and provided a further 92 assists in 504 Premier League appearances.  Those figures place him 11th on the all-time list for appearances in the Premier League, 18th for goals and seventh for assists. Gerrard is joined in the Hall of Fame by Beckham, who won six Premier League titles during his time at Manchester United. He made his Premier League debut in 1995 and went on to make 265 appearances, scoring 62 goals and registering 80 assists – the ninth-highest figure in the competition’s history.
