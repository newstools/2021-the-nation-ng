 The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has faulted the position of the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Lai Mohammed, that terrorism is not a federal offence. The minister had, in reaction to claims by the PDP that the Federal Government has continually failed to prosecute terror offenders, stated that it’s the duty of the respective states to prosecute persons arrested for terrorism. But the PDP, in a statement yesterday by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the Federal Government has capitulated to terrorist onslaught.  The PDP stressed that the statement by the minister was another clear evidence that President Muhammadu Buhari is indeed absent and that he has completely abdicated the responsibilities of his office. The statement said: “Lai Mohammed’s statement further reveals that the Buhari Presidency has not been committed to combating banditry but had, all along, been feeding Nigerians with lies, propaganda and falsehood, while bandits are pillaging our nation. “It is incredulous that the Buhari Presidency, in its failures, is abdicating a responsibility exclusively vested on it by the 1999 Constitution (as amended) to operate all apparatus of national security; the police, military, paramilitary and all other armed services; to secure lives and property in all parts of our country.”
