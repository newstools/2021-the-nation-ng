One thousand, six hundred and ninety-three routine inspections were carried out between May last year and this year by the Lagos State Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, the commissioner, Dr. Lola Akande, has said. Briefing reporters in Alausa, Ikeja to mark the second year anniversary of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration, she said this was part of efforts to ensure best practices in the establishment and running of cooperatives societies. Akande said during the period under review, 2,359 cooperative societies were revalidated, 247 new registrations were accepted, while the state mediated in 410 cases involving cooperative societies. The commissioner said to curb sharp practices in cooperative societies, the House of Assembly has passed a bill and when it becomes a law, it will further strengthen the sector. She said the ministry is making efforts to get national certification of courses offered at the Lagos State Cooperative College, which was established in 2018 to boost the capacity of cooperators in the state. “Currently, 122 students are in session for a professional diploma programme. The ministry is championing the cause of the college to be accredited by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), to run National Diploma in Cooperative Economics and Management and Microfinance and Entrepreneurship Development from 2021/2022 academic session,” Akande said She said during the period under review, the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA) recovered over N44million as compensation and refund of payment for returned substandard goods and services. The commissioner said in the last one year, the government had provided opportunities for MSMEs to thrive, including the establishment of an e-commerce hub, SME’s hub and encouragement of stakeholders to maximise the benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTAA).
