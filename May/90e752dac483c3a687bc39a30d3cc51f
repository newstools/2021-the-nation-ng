 The 6,000km Fibre Metro Connection being laid across Lagos State is to boost digital learning, encourage tele-health, ensure a spike in E-commerce, among other benefits, Commissioner for Science and Technology Hakeem Fahm said yesterday. The first 3,000km was laid in 2020, while the remaining 3,000km will be laid this year. Fahm addressed reporters yesterday as part of activities to mark Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s second year in office. He said the moves were tailored towards making Lagos a Smart City, adding that the interconnectivity would also help to balance life-work activities. Fahm noted that implementation of the Smart City project would incorporate smart technology into transport, infrastructure surveillance and security, health care services, education and government services.  “Safeguarding Lagos has gone beyond the ordinary; we have built new data rooms, installed more cameras and effectively deployed technology in our operations, especially in security and traffic management,” he said. Fahm said about five million residents have been captured by the Lagos State Resident Registration Agency (LASRRA), which will issue them cards to give them access to government programmes and schemes. The commissioner, who urged residents to get registered for their LASRRA card, said people can now pre-register on the portal before the biometric capturing at approved centres. Thirty three registration centres have been reopened after the about 60 centres were shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
