Reckitt Nigeria, makers of Mortein insecticide, has partnered the Ogun State Government to eliminate malaria in Nigeria. It has introduced the ‘Mortein Fight to End Malaria’ campaign to drive home the message of ending malaria. There will be physical market and community engagements, digital education and radio engagement. With state officials, the brand team embarked on clearing blocked drainages and refuse heaps in some markets to further drive home the message that malaria is preventable and treatable. Marketing Director of Reckitt Nigeria, Tanzim Rezwan, at a news conference to mark the World Malaria Day, said the community engagement and collaborations are part of the firm’s purpose-driven initiatives to stem the prevalence of malaria in Nigeria and Africa. “At Reckitt, every day, in everything we do, we’re driven by our purpose – to protect, heal and nurture in the relentless pursuit of a cleaner, healthier world. Mortein, as a leading global insecticide brand, is on a mission to enable and empower our consumers with knowledge and expert solutions to rid themselves of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. We try to bring in world-class products to consumers and also aspire to drive awareness on preventive measures.” The Commissioner for Health Dr. Tomi Coker, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Ayinde Adesanya, thanked the partners for their interventions towards eliminating malaria.
