The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has called on private aircraft owners for verification from June 7- to July 6, 2021, over rising insecurity. Addressing reporters at the NCS Headquarters, Abuja, the Public Relations Officer, Mr. Joseph Attah, noted the measure is to ensure strict compliance with the NCS regulations and revenue generation through the payment of 1 per cent Comprehensive Import Supervision Scheme. His words: “In line with the need to ensure strict compliance with all regulations especially at this time of challenging security situation and reluctance of some highly placed individuals to pay taxes, Nigeria Customs Service will be taking stock of all privately owned aircrafts in the country. “This is to ensure strict compliance with all relevant regulations governing the importation of such aircrafts”. The PRO said the NCS derived its power to conduct the exercise from “Part III Section 27, 35, 45, 46, 47, 52, 56, 63, & 64; Part XI Sections 144, 145, 155, 160, 161 & 164 and Part XII Section 167, 168, 169, 273, & 174 of the Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA) hereby invites all owners of Private Aircraft in the country to come forward with their relevant importation clearance documents for verification”. The NCS expects the private owners to come along with aircraft certification of registration, NCAA’s Flight Operations Compliance Certificate (FOCC), NCAA’s Maintenance Compliance Certificate (MC), NCAA’s Permit for Non-commercial Flights (PNCF) and Temporary Import Permit (TIP) where applicable). He said: “All such owners or their representatives are to report to 305, Tariff and Trade Department, Nigeria Customs Service Headquarters, Zone 3, Abidjan Street, WuseZone 3, Abuja-FCT from Monday 7th June through Tuesday 6th July 2021 between 10:00am and 5:00pm daily, with all the relevant aircraft documents for verification”. Attah insisted failure to comply with the verification exercise will certainly lead to the sanction of the defaulters. The PRO revealed the NCS generated N799,024,705,961.00 between 1st January to 30th May 2021. According to him, when compared with the same period last year, there is a positive difference of N226,110,610,991.00. He attributed the feat to the strict implementation of all extant rules governing imports, exports, and Excise in Nigeria. He also said the service was able to record the increase due to the strategic deployment of officers. Attah said automation of the process and regulations and increasing inclination of officers and men to put national interest above selves were also accountable for the achievement. He attributed it to robust stakeholder sensitization, increasing the level of compliance from stakeholders and improved working relationships with the National Assembly.
