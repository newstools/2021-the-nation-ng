 Nigeria’s Kelechi Iheanacho has urged his teammates to forget about celebration and focus their minds on the FA Cup final game against Chelsea. The player whose goal destroyed Leicester City’s FA Cup 52-year-old jinx said he was overwhelmed after scoring and he hopes to continue in that manner in the final. The Super Eagles striker scored the only goal which secured the Foxes’ progress to their first cup final since 1969. The goal was his 15th of the season after his team defeated Southampton 1-0 in the FA Cup semi-final. ‘’It’s a dream come true. It’s really amazing and a great feeling. Everybody is happy we are progressing. ‘’Our fans would be divided in the final because most of them support Chelsea but we would play our game and get the best result. It is not going to be easy. We will work hard for the final game.’ he told Leicester City TV.
