A Group, Movement for the Actualization of the Dreams of Niger Deltans (MADND) on Saturday appealed to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Malami and the Economic Financial Crime Commission’s Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa to release Government Ekpemupolo aka Tompolo’s seized assets. The group Chairman Mr. Josiah Oyakonghan aka Commander Oyimi made the appeal during Tompolo’s 50th Birthday celebration in Warri, describing the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Mr. Malami and the EFCC Chairman Bawa as men of intergrity. Oyimi appealed to the AGF and EFCC boss to expedite action over the release of Tompolo’s assets, reiterating that the continuous seizure of Tompolo’s asset even when a court of competent jurisdiction has ruled in his favour is not good for the Country. He said; “The continuous seizure of his assets is something that has gone beyond what outsiders and lovers of Tompolo can comprehend hence he made this appeal. I had in previous publications highlighted the pain of the continuous seizure of these assets which have caused Tompolo and the numerous people who are direct employees severe hardship.”
