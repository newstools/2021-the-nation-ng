Fresh from a two-week medical trip to the United Kingdom (UK), President Muhammadu Buhari put Acting Inspector-General (IG) Usman Baba on his toes. He told the police boss not to disappoint Nigerians, whose expectations are high in him as the acting IG. President Buhari returned to Abuja on Thursday after a 16-day trip on medical check-up. Fielding questions from reporters at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, the President recalled the process that produced Baba as acting IG, noting that he had been part of the system all along and has the required experience to secure the country. He said: “Well, we went through the system. There was a committee by the Minister of Police Affairs. They gave me some names and he happened to be the one chosen. “He knows his job, he has been in it for a long time, he went through all the trainings, he has the necessary experience. So, we have a high expectation from him”. On the performance of the Service chiefs, the President said they have so far tried their best to relieve the country of the security crises, expressing the hope that their best would be enough to stabilize the country. Buhari said: “Oh yes, they have been in the system all the way; they know what is wrong; they know what is right and I think they are doing their best. I hope their best will be good enough for Nigeria”. Asked about his medical trip to the UK, the President said: “It went very well”, adding that his return to his duties would witness continuity. The President’s aircraft landed at about 4:45pm. Those at the airport to receive him, were his Chief of Staff (CoS) Prof. Ibrahim Gambari; Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister Malam Muhammed Bello and  National Security Adviser Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno. Others were the Service chiefs, Baba, National Intelligence Agency (NIA) Director-General, Ahmed Rufa’I; Department of State Services Director-General Yusuf Bichi; among others.
