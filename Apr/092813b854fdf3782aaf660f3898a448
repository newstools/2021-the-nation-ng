Emirates Airlines last week operated its one-of-a-kind flight – EK 2021 –  to signal the aviation industry’s readiness for a travel rebound. It was also to celebrate the UAE’s remarkable vaccination programme that has administered close to  nine  million vaccines doses to date. The special flight, which carried fully vaccinated crew and passengers onboard, was unprecedented in the industry in scale. With close to 400 fully vaccinated customers onboard, the flight illustrates confidence and undiminished excitement for air travel. EK 2021 was also supported by fully vaccinated teams across the aviation eco-system, from onboard crew to ground staff, demonstrating the readiness of the UAE’s aviation eco-system to support the safe rebound of air travel. Despite the pandemic, the UAE has maintained its status as a leading global aviation hub and it will continue to grow its position as a hub for passengers and cargo traffic by investing in innovations and close collaborations with all stakeholders. Onboard EK 2021 was a group of senior officials from key aviation and health sector entities hosted by Emirates. Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline & Group, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum,  said: “The UAE’s rapid pace and progress in vaccinating our population is a testament of our leadership’s vision and commitment to safeguard our communities, and manage the pandemic by adopting the appropriate measures to protect both nationals and residents.”
