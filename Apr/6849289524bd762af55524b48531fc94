Former Commissioner for Youth and Social Development in Lagos State, Agboola Dabiri, has revealed that the Community Action Through Sports (CAT) has the backing of the British Council. CAT is a youth program aimed at helping youth kids realise their dreams through sports. According to the founder, Dabiri, the project has produced top stars that have represented the country at various levels. “We give thanks to the British Council who has always supported us through these years,” he said. We have produced players for the national youth teams and some have become professionals in Europe now. So many organisations have also supported us in our aim to take these young kids off the streets.” The Operations Director of the British council in Nigeria, Steven Forbes also said they are currently evaluating and exploring other means to support the CAT foundation.  “It’s been a fantastic project and they are very good at what they are doing. We are very much involved in what they are doing. We are evaluating the initiative and we will in the coming days share with the organisers what we intend to do with them going forward. “CAT is very important to us not just because of the sports but due to the community involvement as it is a means of tackling so many problems at the grassroot level.”
