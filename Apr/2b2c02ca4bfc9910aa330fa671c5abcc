Managing Director, BUA Cement Plc, Engr. Yusuf Binji said the preparedness and the company’s business continuity plan had positive impact on its performance. He also emphasised the importance of product design and how BUA’s current offerings adequately cater to the cement needs of its customers, resulting in a sustained growing market acceptance. He added that significant milestones were attained despite the harsh economic conditions brought about by the pandemic. “Undeniably, the challenges in 2020 have been unprecedented, given the outbreak of the Coronavirus and the disruption caused across homes, communities and organisations. Despite its lingering effect, we witnessed the best of humanity – resilience, as individuals and organisations sought for opportunities to support vulnerable communities, with BUA Cement playing a crucial role in cushioning its effect through its donations,” Binji said. According to him, supporting the resilient performance was the company’s well instituted contingency plan, which ensured that it remained largely immune to economic disruptions such as production, supply and distribution shocks resulting from the lock down; the observed shift by investors to alternative investment asset classes; and the low rain fall recorded during the year. “More importantly, our product offerings played a vital role, with more customers being increasingly able to appreciate and differentiate how tailored our products are towards meeting their cement requirements, especially in terms of quality and product support, among other features. This showcases the thought and dedication that is deeply engraved into our product design processes, with the customer’s need at the centre of everything we do,” Binji said. He highlighted that the performance for the year 2020 witnessed a 13.3 per cent rise in cement dispatched to 5.1 million metric tonnes, adding that the company expects margin expansion, resulting from performance growth and efficiency gains. He added that the company continued focus on cost containment measures due to the need to prioritise efficiency, thus despite the devaluation of the naira, which impacted pricing of some input costs, operating profit increased by 14.8 per cent to N82 billion. “In line with our goals to become the leading cement manufacturer with significant eco-friendly footprints, we set out key strategic targets to enhance growth and transform our operational processes towards a cleaner and more efficient company. We are delighted to have achieved a significant number of these set targets including the construction of the Kalambaina line-3, where we remain on course to commission the plant in 2021,” Binji said.
