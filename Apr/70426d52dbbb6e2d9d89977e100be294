 The Nigerian Army University Biu (NAUB) has trained  commanders of the various security outfits on disaster response. The university,  in line with objectives of its establishment,  organised the maiden edition of its Disaster Response and Management Course, at the Tukur Buratai Institute for War and Peace (TBIWP) of the institution. The four-week course, which lasted all of last month,  was aimed at  exposing participants  to  all aspects of war and peace in Nigeria and across the world. It  was attended by 17 commanders drawn from the armed forces, the Nigeria Police and other paramilitary organisations. The  Vice Chancellor, Prof. Kyari Mohammed, said preparing for disaster in time of peace was crucial, especially in consideration of the multifaceted security threats facing the country. Kyari said the TBIWP was in talks with governments and agencies, especially Borno State Government, on programmes on  stabilisation and post-conflict and peace building in areas liberated by Nigerian armed forces. “The institute offers different courses in areas of speciality such as counter-terrorism, cyber security, counter insurgency and strategic communication,” Kyari said. He urged participants to utilise whatever they learnt to build a strong pool of early responders during and after disasters. The four-week training course comprised 10 modules, including Disaster Prevention, Mitigation & Preparedness; Disaster Response and Relief; Participatory Stakeholders Engagement; Disaster Communication; Crisis Counselling; Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction in Development Effort; Hazard Mapping, Vulnerability & Risk Assessment.
