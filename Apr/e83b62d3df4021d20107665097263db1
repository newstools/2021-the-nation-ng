Leeds United scored early in each half to beat Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United and move into the top half of the Premier League. Leeds were firmly on top at a sunny Elland Road and took an early lead as Raphinha squared for Jack Harrison to tap in his seventh goal of the season. The hosts were made to rue their missed chances in first-half stoppage time as Ben Osborn forced the ball over the line after Oli McBurnie’s shot deflected into his path. But Leeds were back in front inside four minutes of the second half, Phil Jagielka turning Harrison’s low cross into his own net. Substitutes Rhian Brewster and Oliver Burke went close to a late equaliser for the relegation-threatened visitors, who are now 14 points from safety with eight games left. But Leeds were worthy winners on a day they remembered fans Chris Loftus and Kevin Speight, who were killed in Turkey before their Uefa Cup game against Galatasaray in April 2000, and the club’s record goalscorer and former captain Peter Lorimer who died last month. Leeds’ only change to the side which won at Fulham before the international break saw current captain Liam Cooper return in defence, but Raphinha and fellow midfielders Tyler Roberts and Stuart Dallas shone as Leeds edged above Aston Villa into 10th place.
