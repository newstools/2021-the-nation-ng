No fewer than five persons died while two others sustained injuries in a road crash involving four vehicles around Iperu on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Ahmed Umar, Sector Commander of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun, confirmed the incident in a statement on Tuesday in Abeokuta, the state capital. Umar said the accident, which occurred at 8.45am, was caused by dangerous driving and excessive speed which led to loss of control. He said the vehicles involved in the crash included a Mack truck marked and an Iveco truck. Others are two tricycles. The sector commander said that 10 persons were involved in the accident. Umar explained that the five men who died were all in the tricycles while one man and a woman sustained injuries. He said that four of the deceased were deposited at Fakoya Mortuary, a private morgue in Sagamu. Also, the FRSC said it arrested 114, 934 persons across the country between January and March for diverse traffic offences. The Corps Public Education Officer, Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM), Bisi Kazeem, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Tuesday in Abuja. Kazeem said that the most prevalent offence was speed violation, as failure to install speed limiting device had resulted in series of road crashes in the country.
