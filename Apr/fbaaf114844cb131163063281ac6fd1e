Sony Pictures Television (“SPT”) has announced the launch of ‘Sony One’ – an app platform developed in association with MTN, the leading ICT company in Nigeria. Speaking on the launch, John Rossiter, who oversaw the development of the app as Sony Pictures Television Executive Vice President, Networks and Distribution, CEEMA, said, “Sony One is tailor-made to the increasingly flexible way we see media being consumed in Nigeria and across Africa today. Today’s launch marks the first step in an inspiring journey for SPT: we have spent a couple of years reviewing and evaluating effective ways to serve our excellent SPT content to, and engage with, this hugely important continent. It is fantastic to launch this platform, and there is no better partner to launch with than MTN in Nigeria.” Also speaking, Srinivas Rao, Chief Digital Officer, MTN Nigeria, says, “We are proud of our association with Sony Pictures Television. This partnership aligns with our GoodTogether philosophy; with it, our customers, who are at the heart of everything we do, will be assured of quality international content, including movies, music and favourite shows all in one app.”
