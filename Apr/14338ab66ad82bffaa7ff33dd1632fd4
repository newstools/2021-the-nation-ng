Coach Purity Akuh is excited over the qualification of four wrestlers to the Tokyo Olympic Games from the African and Oceania Olympic Qualifier concluded in Tunisia at the weekend. Three women – Blessing Oborududu, Aminat Adeniyi and Adijat Idris as well as Ekerekeme Agiomor in the men’s event picked their tickets to Tokyo from the three-day qualifiers. A delighted Akuh told NationSport yesterday that he was particularly impressed with the women’s team that out of the four that competed, three were able to qualify. “I am happy that we came here with four female wrestlers and three of them made the cut to Tokyo. I must also admit that it was an easy route to Tokyo because all other competitors are in good shape having been waiting for the qualifiers since last year. Unfortunately only of them could not qualify but I must also commend her for her good display,” Akuh said. On the men’s team, he praised the wrestlers for their performance while he singled out Agiomor would went ahead to claim gold in the men’s 86kg after beating Algeria’s Fateh Benferdjallah 6-5 in the final. According to United World Wrestling (UWW), Agiomor could not have scripted a better finish for himself. Despite a surprise start from the Algerian with a five-point throw after starting with a single attack, the Nigerian was trailing 5-6 in the final 10 seconds of the bout, and it was an exposure over the Algerian that fetched Agiomor the gold medal, thus managing to mount an inspiring comeback. Five countries including Nigeria secured the 12 Olympic berths in men’s freestyle that were on the line on the final day of the African and Oceania Olympic Qualifier. Algeria led the way by capturing four quotas while Egypt, Tunisia and Guinea-Bissau claimed two each. Senegal and Nigeria also registered their names by claiming a berth each for the Tokyo Olympics.
