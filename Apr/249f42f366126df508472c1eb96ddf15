A non-governmental group, the Centre for Disability Issues, has said disability is not a disease. The group’s coordinator, Comrade Kehinde Oshilaja, said this in Ebute-Meta, Lagos while delivering a speech at a post-Easter forum and workshop for members. The theme of the workshop is: “Christ legacy, hope for people living with disabilities”. He said the thinking faculty of people living with disability is well-articulated and coordinated, urging them not to be deterred. Mr. Tunde Willoughby, a representative of the Lagos State Office for Disability Affairs (LASODA), said the deficiencies of the people living with disabilities are easily noticed, adding that all human beings, however, have challenges. The Assistant General Overseer, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Funsho Odesola, represented by Pastor Abiodun Ajiboye, spoke about “being redeemed’, a key to opening door of prosperous and greater future. Also, a representative of Iyanu Oluwa Cherubim and Seraphim Church, Tapa Parish, Ebutte Meta, Lagos, Bro. Bamidele Ojuele, spoke about “benefits of the coming back of Jesus Christ on people living with disabilities.” Oshilaja and his team thanked the RCCG headquarters, Ebutte Meta and the General Overseer of the Lord Chosen Charismatic Revival Church, Pastor Lazarus Mouka, for donating food items, money and clothes to people living with disabilities.
