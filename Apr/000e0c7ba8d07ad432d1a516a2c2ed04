If Anthony Joshua has been following Tyson Fury’s recent antics on Instagram, it should provide him with few fears. The Gypsy King appears to be loving life during a trip to Las Vegas as crunch talks continue over their heavyweight unification bout. A month ago, it was confirmed the pair had finally signed a contract for a two-fight deal. But an official fight announcement has still not been made over where and when the showdown will take place. A summer fight is anticipated, however, promoters Eddie Hearn and Frank Warren have been scrambling to sort out the finer details. Fury himself gave a deadline of Tuesday  to get everything arranged otherwise he threatened to pull out of the fight. Yet in Vegas, he hardly gave off the impression of a man frustrated with the seeming lack of progression away from the ring. The 32-year-old filmed and pictured himself sunning it up in a Vegas pool at a lush hotel, hailing sponsor Wow Hydrate for arranging the trip to Sin City. Fury told his Instagram followers: “I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Wow Hydrate for looking after us and bringing the Gypsy King to Vegas. “Living like an absolute rockstar, so big shoutout to Wow Hydrate, the best sponsor in the game, the best drink in the game, pushing to be the best.” The Gypsy King was also filmed performing on stage – inside his hotel room on top of the furniture – as he played an air guitar with ACDC blaring in the background.
