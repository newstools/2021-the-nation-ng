 Police in Kogi State yesterday said they trailed kidnapers to their den in Ajaokuta, rescued an abdutee, and recovered two AK-47 rifles and other weapons. The command, in a statement issued yesterday by spokesman William Aya, said  the unnamed kidnap victim, was abducted the previous day. Aya, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said the victim’s vehicle was stopped by four armed men, around the PYN Junction, and whisked him away.  The statement read: “Police operatives attached to Ajaokuta Division on 25th April, 2021 at about 2000hrs rescued a kidnapped victim and recovered two AK47 rifles with 29 rounds of live ammunition. “The police operatives acted on a report received at about 0330hrs of 25/4/2021 that four armed men stopped a vehicle at PYN Junction Ajaokuta and adopted a man into the bush. “Consequent upon the report, the Divisional Police Officer, CSP Shola Night, led a team of officers to the scene and trailed the hoodlums to the bush, stormed their hideout and engaged them in a gun duel which led the hoodlums to flee with bullet wounds, while the victim was rescued unhurt and two AK47 rifles with 29 rounds of ammunition were recovered. “The Commissioner of Police, Kogi State Command, Ede Ayuba Ekpeji, calls on members of the public to sharpen their power of observation and be on the lookout on anybody seen with bullet wounds and report to the nearest police station or any other security agents. “He assures the law abiding people of the state that the renewed commitment of the Kogi State Police Command to sustain the tempo of the fight against criminality in the state and guarantee protection of live and property remains unequivocal and unwavering.”
