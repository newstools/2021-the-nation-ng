The Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), Prof. Ikpeme Ikpeme, has said modern equipment have been installed at the hospital in the last two years to meet the health care needs of the patients. Ikpeme, who conducted reporters round the hospital at the weekend, said UCTH had upscaled service delivery in line with the health care needs of its patients. “My passion is to build, improve and upscale the level of services we render at the teaching hospital,” he added. The CMD said modern equipment have been installed at the departments to curb the migration of people out of the state for medical care. He said his administration had acquired a Direct Digital X-ray System, 4D Ultra Sound Scanner and a 32 Slight City Scanner at the Department of Radiology. Ikpeme said patients, who visit the hospital for radiologic intervention, don’t need to go outside the state for the service any longer.
