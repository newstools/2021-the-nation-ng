The Managing Director of Northeast Development Commission (NEDC)  Mr Mohammed Alkali, has said that recurring attacks on communities in Borno State is affecting reconstruction and other developments in the state. Alkali told reporters on Thursday in Maiduguri shortly after a meeting with the Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum over the latest attack on Damasak Town, headquarters of Mobbar Local Government Area that attacks had been slowing down reconstruction process by the commission and other stakeholders. He added that whenever there was an attack and destruction like it happened in Damasak, the commission had to go back to the drawing board. He explained that “recurrent attacks have been slowing down what we are doing, particularly in reconstruction and other developments, with resources going for humanitarian support such as providing consumables.” While reiterating commitment to work with authorities from frontline states in providing succour to victims of insurgency in the Northeast, Alkali said NEDC was set to support farmers with inputs whenever they return to farm in liberated areas. “Humanitarian intervention is part of our jobs to provide necessary support where needed and we are going to do it not only in Damasak where the latest attack occurred but also to the whole state,” Alkali said.
