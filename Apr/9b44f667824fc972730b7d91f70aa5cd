The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has denied the revocation of 32 refinery licences issued to private companies in Nigeria. Its head, Public Affairs, Paul Osu, issued the rejoinder on Tuesday. He said: “We wish to clarify that DPR did not revoke any refinery licence. Refinery licence like our other regulatory instruments have validity periods for investors to attain certain milestones”. Osu said this implies that after the validity period for the particular milestone, the licence becomes inactive until the company reapplies for revalidation to migrate to another milestone. He noted this does not in any way translate to revocation of licence of the company. The rejoinder also explained the DPR in line with the aspirations of the government initiated the refinery revolution programme of government aimed at boosting local refining capacity by enabling business and creating new opportunities for investors with the granting of modular and conventional refinery licenses. Osu noted DPR will continue to provide support to investors in the oil and gas industry using our regulatory instruments of licences, permits and approvals to stimulate the economy and align with governments job creation initiatives.
