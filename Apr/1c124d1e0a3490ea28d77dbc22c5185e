 Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua have stopped FaceTiming  each other as an announcement on their fight is due. The Brits are looking to face each other in a unifying bout to decide the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. Talk about the fight started after the Gypsy King won the WBC belt from Deontay Wilder over a year ago. And it saw them stay in regular contact, with Fury sharing one of his FaceTimes to the IBF, WBA, IBO and WBO champion on a documentary. But the Gypsy King has been staying focussed on himself as contract talks have continued. The Sun quote the Mancunian as revealing: “I haven’t spoken to AJ at all during this deal, we used to FaceTime each other but not recently. “Other people are getting paid a lot to get this done so we don’t need to.”  The pair signed off on a deal last month but still needed to agree  to a venue and fees. Saudi Arabia is currently leading the way to host the fight while the fees have proved more challenging. But Fury believes that news of the – but he also had a warning that could throw the fight into jeopardy if news is not heard soon. Speaking to YouTube channel Behind the Gloves, the Gypsy King said: “I have been told there are a few good offers on the table, from a few different countries, from some very rich people, so I am confident. “Saudi is involved, I will say that much, but there are also some dark horses involved who have offered some serious money. The Gypsy King also said he is expecting news soon – but is still willing to ‘move on’ if it doesn’t come soon
