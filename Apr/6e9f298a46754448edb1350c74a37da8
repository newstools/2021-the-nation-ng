Following the partnership deal, Dangote Group, the biggest customer of SHACMAN brand in Nigeria, has taken delivery of additional 400 trucks. Dangote Group, touted as the largest buyer of SHACMAN brand in Nigeria, has since the entrance of SHACMAN vehicles into the Nigerian market through Transit Support Services Limited (TSS) as SHACMAN Nigeria six years ago, bought over 3,500 units of the brand. It was learnt that Dangote’s recognition of SHACMAN as reliable heavy-duty vehicles, influenced the patronage of the trucks. According to the truck firm, Dangote group has absolute trust in the quality of the locally-assembled SHACMAN trucks that are backed by a warranty of global standard and after-sales services. Since the partnership started in 2016 with an initial order of 500 locally-assembled SHACMAN Trucks by Dangote, the company’s commitment to empowering local manufacturers and the continuous patronage have created jobs in the Southeast by reviving ANAMMCO plant in Enugu with an opportunity to produce trucks locally instead of importing them. The gesture has also brought back Onne Port in Rivers State with over 3,000 containers arrived since ANAMMCO was resuscitated TSS Motors’ General Manager, Mr Dave Chukwudulue, said: “We will continue to create value for users of SHACMAN trucks in Nigeria by supporting them with the best after-sales service programme. This has indeed resulted in the increasing demand for our trucks” Shaanxi Heavy Duty Automobile, Manufacturers of SHACMAN Heavy and Medium Duty Trucks and Road Tractors, is one of the biggest truck manufacturing company in China. With other customers like BUA Cement, ABC Transport, AA Global logistics, NUSTANZA Motors and many others, TSS said over 4,500 SHACMAN trucks are running on the roads at the moment.
