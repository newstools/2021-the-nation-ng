A police inspector alleged to have killed a man at a Lagos nightclub has been dismissed from service, the command said on Sunday evening. Inspector Jonathan Kampani who was attached to Mounted Troop on March 18 opened fire on one Jelili Bakare during a disagreement at Quinox Lounge, Sangotedo. The killer cop was said to have fled the scene after shooting the victim but was eventually apprehended by policemen. Kampani, according to a statement by spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi, has now been handed over to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) for prosecution following legal advice from the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP). “The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu, had ordered for the arrest and immediate orderly room trial of the inspector after the incident. He also led a team of senior officers in the command to pay a condolence visit to the family of the deceased at Chief Bakare’s House, Ajiranland, Eti-Osa Local Government of Lagos State, on Saturday, March 27, where he promised that justice will be done in the matter,” Adejobi said.
