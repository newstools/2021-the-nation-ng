Former Italian international Luigi Cagni believes Victor Osimhen possesses the quality to become one of the best in the world. Osimhen who netted Napoli’s second goal in their 2-0 away win over Sampdoria in the Serie  yesterday,  had scored twice in the last three games for coach Gennaro Gattuso’s side. Cagni, a former coach of Brescia told Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli yesterday that with steady improvement, the Nigerian can rival some of the best in the world. “From the first time I saw Victor Osimhen I noticed an extraordinary and very strong player from all points of view. It is a great investment, it costs a lot but it will give the right satisfactions in due course, I don’t think so. I’m wrong. Every time I see him play, I notice something different and from my point of view is complete in every respect. “He has to learn and improve on the mental and physical level. It will become one of the best in the world,” he said. On Osimhen’s performance in Napoli’s 2=1 away loss to Juventus last week, Cagni said: “I can’t watch him, it’s absurd to see defenders in the area all looking at the ball and no one cares about the opponent’s attacker.”
