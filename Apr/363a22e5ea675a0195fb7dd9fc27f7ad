Tottenham Hotspur’s tumultuous week continued with a late win over Southampton as Heung-Min Son’s late penalty secured a win in the first game under caretaker coach Ryan Mason. Son’s late spot-kick earned Spurs a win that a lively second-half display just about merited. But the match had looked very different before the break, with visitors Southampton dominating, opening the scoring through Danny Ings and denied on a number of occasions by Hugo Lloris. It was all change after the interval, with Mason’s Spurs clicking into gear and equalising through Gareth Bale. And the hosts thought they had completed their comeback when Son slotted home from a Reguilon cut-back, only for VAR to rule the goal out for Lucas obstructing the goalkeeper’s view. But VAR did come up in Tottenham’s favour late on, adjudging that a foul on Reguilon occurred fractionally inside the box, and Son did the rest from the spot. A point leaves Spurs in seventh and in danger of missing out on the European qualification places all together – something that presumably is now a matter of concern after the collapse of the Super League plan. Southampton remain in lower mid-table and with little to play for except pride now after the FA Cup exit.
