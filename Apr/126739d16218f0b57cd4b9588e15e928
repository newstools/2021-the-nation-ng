 Don’t expect perfection from us because we’re not but our God is and we have put him at the center,” actress Biola ‘eyin oka’ Adebayo made known after exchanging vows with her man. The popular Nollywood actress laid her genuine thoughts to fans and social media followers after tying the nuptial knot on Tuesday, April 27, 2021. “Babe, thanks for choosing me to walk the “Journey” of life with you, I wholeheartedly choose you above anyone else,” the actress wrote as she acknowledges and showered encomiums on her husband.  Adebayo, who also shared a video of her wedding proceedings in a registry, expressed how she conquered her fear of marriage. “Happy married life to us babe. I said Yes! and today we started a journey forever. This journey called marriage as assertive as I can be with many things in life, definitely not sure I am with “marriage” my fears have held me down for so long but then I held unto his word and “I believe “ I do not believe in my strength or ability but I believe in the one that knows the end even before it begins (The Alpha and Omega) I dropped all my fears and worries at the feet of the Lord Jesus, I’ll do my part and I’ll leave God to perfect the rest.”
