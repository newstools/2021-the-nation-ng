Nigeria’s leading retail bank, Access Bank Plc is combining organic and inorganic growth strategies to drive its vision of Africa’s financial hub. Amid the disruptions caused by COVID-19 pandemic, Access Bank grew its financials as well as footprints across Africa. Deputy Group Business Editor, Taofik Salako, examines underlying fundamentals behind the latest operational reports  The board of Access Bank Plc has announced a 23.1 per cent increase in dividend payout to shareholders. The double-digit increase in cash dividend reflected the performance of the bank in 2020. Amid the disruptions caused by COVID-19 global pandemic, key performance indicators remained on the upward with double-digit growths in the top-line, bottom-line and market share. The bank also demonstrated resilience and stability, combining its organic growth with keen focus on its complementary strategy of value-based mergers and acquisitions. Access Bank capped its latest pan-African expansion drive with the milestone of being the first Nigerian bank to venture into South Africa with the recent approval of its acquisition of South Africa’s Grobank Limited. In 2020 alone, Access Bank opened for business in Kenya and Mozambique while growing its market share in Zambia with the acquisition of Cavmont Bank Limited by Access Bank Zambia, a deal that was concluded in January 2021. The Grobank Limited deal is expected to be concluded this quarter, after receiving the much-awaited regulatory approval.

New opportunities Access Bank has already launched a process to realign its operating structure along a holding company (holdco) structure. The holdco, which has received the approval-in-principle from the Central Bank of Nigeri (CBN), will operate four subsidiaries in order to explore opportunities in key areas of consumer lending market, electronic payments industry and retail insurance market. According to the bank, the proposed holdco structure would enable it to further accelerate its objectives around business diversification, improved operational efficiencies, talent retention as well as robust governance. Group Managing Director, Access Bank Plc, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, said the bank’s continuing expansion as signified by the recent South African transaction, underlined its commitment to its strategic intent of becoming Africa’s gateway to the world, in pursuit of its vision to be the world’s most respected African bank. He outlined that Access Bank’s presence in South Africa will accelerate the bank’s corporate goal of delivering its ‘more than banking’ value proposition to 100 million unique customers across the continents. He said the restructuring and strategic acquisitions across the continent will result in a more connected African banking network that builds on Access Bank’s existing foundation and enhances its value proposition to stakeholders, including customers and employees. According to him, shareholders will benefit from the economies of scale of a larger banking network, including the associated cost efficiencies arising from the bank’s federated information technology system and replication of investments in innovative products across a wider range of markets. He outlined that a broader and connected Africa network remains a core strategic focus for geographic earnings growth and diversification, which will further enhance profitability and risk metrics. He added that with these expansionary transactions, Access Bank will be well placed to promote regional trade finance and other cross-border banking services, further leveraging its presence in key global trade corridors in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), United Kingdom (UK), China, Lebanon and India. “We have consistently said that we are focused on building the scale needed to become a leading African bank; one that leverages our experienced and growing talent base and key stakeholder partnerships towards driving sustainable impact and profitability,” Wigwe said. He said with a broader presence across the continent, Access Bank will be better placed to support its customers who are increasingly looking towards intra Africa growth. This will further accelerate the bank’s momentum towards delivering world class banking services to an expanded customer base across Africa. He noted that the bank last year continued its consistent growth in its retail banking business, leading to a 5.8 million growth in customer sign-on during the year through the bank’s financial inclusion drive and retail revenue of N177.2 billion in 2020 as against N107.8 billion in 2019. According to him, the bank intensified recovery efforts and undertook significant write off and leveraged its robust risk management practices, with the improvement in assets quality expected to continue as the bank strives to surpass the standard it had built in the industry prior to the merger with Diamond Bank. “The strategic actions that the bank has taken over the past 12 months evidence a strong focus on retail banking and financial inclusion, an African expansion strategy and a drive for scale for sustainable value creation,” Wigwe said. He assured that as the bank enters the fourth year of its five-year cyclical strategy, its focus remains on consolidating its retail momentum and expanding its African footprint in a sustainable manner. Wigwe commended the dedication, commitment and support of board, management and staff of the bank, shareholders and other stakeholders who made contributions to the success of the bank. With its holdco restructuring, continuing pan-African expansion and quick eyes for value-added inorganic opportunities, Access Bank is a bank to watch in the years ahead. Investors might as well be taking positions in the long-term with the focus on the bank’s shares since the latest audit. Access Bank closed weekend as the second most active stock at the stock market, driving by bargain opportunities.
