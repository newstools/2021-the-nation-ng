 he inability of candidates for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) to create their profile yesterday forced the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to put registration for the examination on hold. The registration was expected to hold from April 8 to May 15, 2021. But as of yesterday, most banks were not able to generate the ePin (forms) for the candidates. A computer-based test (CBT) centre operator told our reporter that he was unable to download the application for the registration. The CBT owner said candidates who visited his centre were turned back because of the challenges. The board, which announced the guidelines for this year’s UTME, made the use of the National Identity Number (NIN) compulsory for the examination.  In a statement in Abuja by JAMB’s Head of Media and Protocol, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, the board confirmed the challenges surrounding the registration. It said the delay followed the examination body’s effort to ensure that candidates have access to its registration App for the 2021 UTME/DE and finalise work on its pin vending process before the take-off of the exercise. JAMB advised prospective candidates to follow up on advertisements for the 2021 registration to understand the steps involved and the actual date of the exercise. “To be sure all processes are completed before the commencement, the board did not place its advertorial as it was yet to complete the process of a smooth pin vending and candidate access to the registration App for the 2021 UTME/DE. “This delay is caused by some unforeseen circumstances occasioned by our determined effort to have a NIN integration. This challenge is being resolved and once that is done, all processes shall commence,” the statement added.
