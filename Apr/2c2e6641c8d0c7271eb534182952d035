Chairman of Council Yoruba Global Alliance, Akogun Tola Adeniyi, has described the death of Afenifere spokesman Yinka Odumakin as a “thunderbolt strike into the heart of Yoruba nationalism.” He said the deceased was “bold, bright and outspoken,” praising him as a study in courage and fearlessness. He hailed Odumakin’s commitment to the Yoruba struggle, declaring he put his life on the line for the crusade. Adeniyi, in his tributes, said: “He stood stoutly against the recolonization of Nigeria and the entire Nigerian indigenous Nationalities. “By his death, all the free peoples of the world have lost a roaring voice, the Yoruba nation has lost a champion, and all the Self-Determination Organizations have lost an icon. “My heart goes out in sympathy to Pa Ayo Adebanjo, the Afenifere family, his heroic wife Joe and children and to the entire oppressed peoples of Nigeria.”
