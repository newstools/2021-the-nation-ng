Cross River Governor Ben Ayade has assured he will finish his eight-year tenure strong despite challenges. He spoke a rally in Calabar organised to drum up support for him by chairmen of Local Government Areas with their councillors in collaboration with thousands of his political appointees. A visibly excited Ayade, who has been facing challenges in the PDP over control of the party structures in the state, said: “I respect you all and I want you to be strong in the faith; we are going to end strong, every single factory has started; Cally Air, one of the aircraft has landed, another one will soon land and we get started. Stay strong and you will see how Ayade will end”. He added: “When I finish, in another 3 months you will see a different State and I say it with all sense of modesty because I know what I have put on the ground; the Bakassi Deep Seaport, we are lucky to announce that we already have investors who have taken over Bakassi Deep Seaport. “We are lucky to announce that we have investors who have taken over the Super Highway Project. I am not borrowing money to do those big projects because any project I can’t do with my pocket, I do with my intellectual money. “For six years I have not defaulted in paying salaries and pensions; God is sitting on the throne for those who do not see, they will never see. If you know the history where we are coming from and you know where we are today, you will know that it’s not been easy but God is with me”. Senior Special Adviser to the Governor on Political Matters, Dr. Peter Ojie, argued Ayade’s ability to industrialise the state in the face of meagre resources shows competence, stressing “this rally is also meant to demonstrate that the support we gave him in 2015 and 2019 was not in vain.”
