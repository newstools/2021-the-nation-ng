A former Speaker of Cross River State House of Assembly, John Gaul Lebo, has aired his views over the political crisis rocking the governing Peoples Democratic Party in Cross the state. Speaking on a state television programme monitored from Calabar, Lebo who is currently the Special Envoy of the State to the Gulf of Guinea said “the PDP crisis in the state is all about fears and ambition ahead of 2023 elections in the State”. His words, “what is going on in the Cross River State political landscape today as regards the strange agitation as to who is the leader of the party in Cross River State is baseless and it is a practical display where people are just trying to market their fears and ambition ahead of 2023.” He posited that “Governor Ben Ayade will navigate the PDP family to 2023 where he will seat as the umpire in the PDP Conclave to ensure the harmonization of the zoning positions.”
