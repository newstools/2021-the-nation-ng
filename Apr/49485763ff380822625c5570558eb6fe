 Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane has replied to Jurgen Klopp’s “strange” stadium remark after Liverpool’s humbling loss on Tuesday. The Reds’ season is hanging by a thread after an error-strewn 3-1 Champions League quarter-final first-leg loss in Spain; both Trent Alexander-Arnold and Alisson at fault for goals. The game was being played at Real Madrid’s 6,000-seat Di Stefano Stadium, which is home to their ‘B’ side with the club using the absence of fans to speed up renovations on their Santiago Bernabeu home. That has been the case since for nearly a year, a “strange” situation which Klopp hopes may work in his favour with the second leg being held at a “proper” stadium. “It must be a really tricky task for Real Madrid at Anfield, with or without supporters,” he said. “Tonight was really strange, it was a difficult and different situation because of the stadium. “Anfield is at least a proper stadium and that will be good for us.” When asked about Klopp’s remarks, Zidane simply said: “I don’t have an opinion about what Jurgen says, we are proud to play in this stadium.”
