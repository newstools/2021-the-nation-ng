The police on Thursday whisked away acting chairman of Social Democratic Party(SDP), Osun State, Elder Femi Awe, during a prayer session organised by the party. The session held at Ajegunle area opposite Dugbe Police Station, Osogbo capital of Osun State. The programme commenced around 11:30am as Christian and Muslim clerics led prayers for Nigeria, Osun State and the party. After a traditionalist offered prayer, Elder Awe was approached by some policemen in mufti who accused him of organising such a programme in public without informing security operatives. However, Awe apologised and tendered received a copy of letters of a notification addressed to the police, DSS and NSCDC. The operatives insisted the Commissioner of Police instructed them to bring him to Osun State Police Command for questioning. Elder Awe was whisked away in an unregistered black jeep. Osun SDP Secretary, Azeez Musbau, said: “We had informed the Police, Department of State Service (DSS) and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on 14th of April 2021 about the programme. “All the security agencies certified they received the copy but we are surprised that the police came into the programme today and took away the chairman of the party even though we presented the copies of a letter that they received our notification. “No matter the intimidation we are a strong party in Osun State.”
