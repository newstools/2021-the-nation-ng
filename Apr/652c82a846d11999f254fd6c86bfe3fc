Executive Director of National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) Dr Faisal Shuiabu has revealed the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccines may not arrive in Nigeria due to the global scarcity of vaccines. He disclosed this in Lafia, Nasarawa State at the North Central zonal town hall meeting on COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria. According to him: “I would like to state that there is a global scarcity of COVID-19 Vaccines due to high demand for the vaccines, especially in countries where they are being produced. “For this reason, we anticipate a delay in vaccine supply to Nigeria. This government has therefore decided to rationalise by preserving 50% of available doses of the vaccines for administration as second doses. “What this means is that in each state of the federation, including FCT, only 50% of allocated doses of vaccines are currently being administered. The remaining 50% will be administered 8-12 weeks from the date of the first doses.” He said efforts are ongoing globally to ensure vaccines are made available as required for attaining herd immunity worldwide. He added the Federal Government is committed to ensuring vaccines are supplied to Nigeria for smooth continuation of our campaign
