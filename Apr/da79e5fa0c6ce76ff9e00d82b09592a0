Bayelsa  State’s  star swimmer  at the on-going National Sports Festival  in Benin City, Ifiezibe Gagbe,  would be N.5m richer courtesy of the Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle, Ebi Egbe. Gagbe  won eight  gold medals in the swimming events of   Edo 2020 to the  delight of Egbe , a former sports commissioner in Bayelsa State. Egbe  stressed that with the performance of Gagbe,  Bayelsa  State can rule the world in anything water sport if the right things are done and the needed facilities put in place. In his words: “We can rule the world at the Olympics in Canoeing and Rowing because we have the best Regatta pavilion and fantastic lake in West Africa for training in Bayelsa state, “ explained Egbe. “Oxbow lake and regatta centre pavilion in Yenagoa is the best canoeing and rowing training centre in West Africa. “ I’m also happy today because I did contribute my little quota to the fine run of Bayelsa in Edo 2020. The facilities I constructed and donated to my state saw our athletes training at home in our dear state for the first time ever, before storming Benin for the  national Sports Festival.” Egbe was quick to add that he is happy Bayelsa is being run by a governor who loves and knows sports inside out having served as a sports commissioner before now. “Diri understands and loves sports, he was a sports commissioner in my state and with that background he knows what to do to take Bayelsa sports to the next level,” Egbe noted.
