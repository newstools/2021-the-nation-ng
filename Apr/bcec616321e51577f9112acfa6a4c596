The Women’s Rights and Health Project (WRAHP) has held a seminar for pupils in Lagos on how to protect themselves against sexual assault. A representative of WRAHP, Adeola Oloke, said the campaign became necessary because pupils were falling victim to sexual violence. “They need to learn how to protect themselves against sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). “A lot of people don’t speak up so we want to enhance and empower them to speak up when their rights are violated.” The town-hall meetings are also aimed at increasing SGBV reporting in Alimosho, the largest council in the state. The project is with support from the EU funded Rule of Law and Anti-corruption (RoLAC) programme managed by the British Council in Nigeria. It is part of her project titled Increasing access to justice-related services to mobilise communities. The project, among others, has established the Ireti Resource Centre in Ikotun to support vulnerable people and SGBV survivors by providing them with free services. The project is currently training secondary school pupils on improving reporting of SGBV incidents. The proprietress of Hansy Comprehensive College, Ayobo, Mrs Emeya Hannah, said there was a need to open the eyes of the pupils to the topic. “The school has been trying to speak to them about it but we felt that they should also hear it from the experts. “That’s why we embraced WRAHP when they came to us. “Children need to understand that they have full right to their body,” she said.
