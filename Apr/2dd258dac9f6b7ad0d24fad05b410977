Abductors of three construction workers in Ondo State have demanded N20m ransom to release them. The victims were working on the 16km Ikaram-Akunnu road in Akoko Northwest and Akoko North East Local Government Areas when the gunmen struck. Security operatives, including hunters, vigilance groups have been combing the bush since Tuesday when the workers were kidnapped. Ondo Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami, said more personnel have been deployed to the Akoko axis to help secure release of the workers. He stated the kidnappers usually flee to neighbouring states after kidnapping their victims in Ondo.
