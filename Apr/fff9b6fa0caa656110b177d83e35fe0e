Lagos State Government through the Office of Public Private Partnerships (OPPP) in conjunction with Messrs Awabike Ltd, is set to pilot an environmentally/health- friendly non- motorised transport initiative tagged “Bike Share Scheme”, with Alausa Secretariat being one of the proposed pilot locations. According a statement by the Director General, Mr. Ope George at the PPP office in Lagos, the project entails a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a token fee without incurring the costs and responsibilities associated with ownership. He said: “Urbanisation has reached unprecedented advanced stage in Lagos State, leading to traffic congestion; hence; there is need to work out modalities of easing traffic in the metropolis.” The director general said the introduction of the Bike Share Scheme is in line with Lagos State Government’s T.H.E.M.E.S agenda to achieve a transport scheme which is environmentally friendly and affordable to road users. The Bike Share Scheme George said, would reduce carbon emission and provide a good form of body exercise thereby promoting fitness, while also improving wellness and stimulating good health and longevity for users.
