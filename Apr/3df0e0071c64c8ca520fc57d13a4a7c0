A former coordinator of Anuagata Development Centre in Ohaozara Local Government of Ebonyi State, Chief Amos Ogbonnaya, has again sued Governor Dave Umahi for wrongful termination of his appointment. Unlike his March 2019 suit in which he asked the National Industrial Court of Nigeria(NICN) to order Umahi and his government to pay him over N20 million, representing his allowances, security vote and other withheld entitlements, he is asking the same court in Enugu to direct the governor to pay him N500 million for wrongful dismissal. In the latest suit marked NICN/EN/08/2021 and filed on 01/04/2021, Ogbonnaya listed the state’s Attorney-General and Justice Commissioner, Cletus N. Ofoke and the Senior Special Adviser to the Governor on   Rural Development, Enekwachi Akpa, as the co-defendants.
