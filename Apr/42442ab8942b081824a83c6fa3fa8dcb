The Lagos Chapter of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) has decided to resume partially. This, it said, was based on a meeting with stakeholders during which 70 percent of their demands were met. JUSUN Lagos Chairman, Asiwaju Shobowale Kehinde, confirmed their axillary demands are being speedily looked into and results manifesting.
