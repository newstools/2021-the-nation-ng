The inability of candidates to create their profiles on Thursday forced the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to put registration for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) on hold. The exercise was expected to commence on 8th April to Saturday, 15th May, 2021. But as Thursday, most banks were not able to generate the ePin (forms) for candidates. A Computer Based Test Centre operator told The Nation they were unable to download the application to use for the registration. The CBT owner said candidates who visited his centre were turned back because of these challenges. The board, while announcing the guidelines for this year’s UTME, made the use of the National Identity Number (NIN) compulsory for the examination. In a statement by JAMB’s Head of Media and Protocol, Dr. Fabian Benjamin in Abuja, the board confirmed the challenges surrounding the registration exercise. He said the delay followed the examination body’s effort to ensure candidates have access to its registration app for the 2021 UTME/DE and also finalise work on its pin vending process before the take-off of the exercise. JAMB advised prospective candidates to follow up on advertisements for the 2021 registration exercise to understand the steps involved and the actual date of the registration exercise. ”To be sure all processes are completed before the commencement, the Board didn’t place its advertorial as it was yet to complete the process of a smooth pin vending and candidate access to the registration app for the 2021 UTME/DE. ”This delay is caused by some unforeseen circumstances occasioned by our determined effort to have a NIN integration. This challenge is being resolved and once that is done, all processes shall commence,” the statement added.
