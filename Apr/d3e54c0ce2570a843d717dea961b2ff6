Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel praised midfielder Mason Mount’s attitude after the England international scored his first Champions League goal in Wednesday’s 2-0 win against Porto in Seville. Mount and Ben Chilwell scored to put Chelsea in the driving seat ahead of the “home” leg of the quarterfinal on April 13, which will also be played in Seville due to Covid-19 travel restrictions between Portugal and England. Since Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard at Stamford Bridge in January, Mount has scored five goals in all competitions, more than any other Chelsea player. “The finish was clinical from Mason,” Tuchel told reporters. “He has the quality to do this and to do it in a quarterfinal is a big step for him. “He has the right attitude towards success. He is open and hungry to learn.” At 22 years and 87 days, Mount also became Chelsea’s youngest goalscorer in a Champions League knockout game. “Mason is a key player for us and I am happy he fits into this role at a young age,” Tuchel added.
