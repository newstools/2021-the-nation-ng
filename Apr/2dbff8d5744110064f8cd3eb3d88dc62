The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has described the rumoured attack by okada operators on police personnel in the Lekki area of the state, as captured in a viral video, as false and mischievous. Spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi said in a statement that the Command after carefully studying the video, noticed that its originators distorted the fact and raised false alarm. “The command wishes to set the record straight that on Monday, April 26, at about 09:30am, the Divisional Police Officer in Maroko, Lagos State, was informed that some okada riders were on rampage by resisting the police from impounding their motorcycles at Lekki Phase 1 Gate. “The area falls within the restricted areas for okada operations in the state. The Divisional Police Officer then called for reinforcement and ordered his policemen to race to the place to take charge and restore normalcy. “The policemen were able to curtail their activities and chased them to their hideout where 31 of their motorcycles were impounded and one of the leaders, one Mohammed, was arrested. Normalcy has been restored to the area.” he said,” Adejobi said.
