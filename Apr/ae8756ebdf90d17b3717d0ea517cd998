 Fireboy’S official Disc Jockey, DJ TGarbs has reiterated that her curvy shape was not gotten from going under the knife. DJ TGarms made this known in her Instagram stories recently. The Audiomack Africa ambassador said, “A lot of you for some reason still think my body is fake, it is not, just going to reiterate this point. I have never got any bodywork and in all honesty, my body is 90% genetics. On my mum’s side of the family and my dad’s side, it’s big women, big breasts, big bums, small waist, so when I was growing up, that is all I saw. In terms of maintaining it, I do not do anything dramatic. I promise you, there are no enhancement pills or teas that I take, I do not believe in that. I honestly feel like just go to the gym, you don’t even have to go to the gym, just work out and move, get active and eat well like I make sure I’m drinking water, I eat fruit, I eat vegetables.”  Continuing, she said, “When I want to treat myself with food, I treat myself with food, I never go on a diet. Just love yourself, your body is your temple, take care of your temple, do you get? that is the philosophy I live by.” Born Oluwatomi Garber, the British-Nigerian presenter also narrated how she relocated to Nigeria after her first visit. On why she decided to remain bald, she said “I’m probably never going to grow my hair, I don’t have any intentions of growing my hair, when I see myself getting married I see myself getting married bald.”
