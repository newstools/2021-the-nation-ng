Bandits have abducted two nurses during an attack on a General Hospital in Idon, Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna. The incident, which occurred in the early hours of Thursday, was barely 30 hours after gunmen abducted students of Greenfield University in Kaduna state and killed a staff. Chairman of Kajuru local government area Hon. Cafra Caino confirmed the incident. He called on residents to remain calm as investigation has commenced into the incident. Though authorities were yet to respond to the incident, the Medical Director, Dr. Shingyu Shamnom, told journalists the gunmen gained access to the hospital through the fence. Accoording to him, they shot sporadically and whisked away the two nurses on night duty who came out identified themselves as medical workers. He said: “We were in our homes until a call was put through to us that it was kidnappers who invaded the hospital, only to discover that two of the nurses on night duty have been taken away by the bandits. “The kidnappers went away with the phone of one of the staff whom we thought was also kidnapped but he later returned.”
