A group of agitators and activists, under the auspices of the Niger Delta Advocates for Peace and Good Governance (NDAPGG), has faulted the position of the Pan Niger Delta Elders Forum (PANDEF), against misquoting the comment of the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, on the relocation of oil companies to the Niger Delta. Sylva had reportedly suggested that no multinational oil companies would contemplate relocating their headquarters to the Niger Delta because the area was insecure and not peaceful. The NDAPGG, in a statement on Saturday, by its National Coordinator, self-styled ‘General’ Fiawei Pathfinder, Peres Ayama and Double Snake, declared that the comment of PANDEF was misplaced and misconstrued the minister’s statement. The coalition said the position of Sylva was that the multi-national oil companies operating in the region would not be able to relocate their headquarters to the region without putting the necessary measures to achieve lasting peace in the volatile region first. “Sylva is still deeply involved in giving a sense of belonging to the people of the Niger Delta as an elder statesman like any other persons. It is rather unfortunate to hear PANDEF that claimed to be agitating for peace and sustainable development of the region to rise up and malign the minister and attempt to bully him over his position on the relocation of oil multinationals. “It is on record that Chief Timipre Sylva has done a lot towards the sustainable peace that is existing in the region today and as we speak there are a lot of projects ongoing in the region that have created job opportunities to the youths in Bayelsa State and other states in the Southsouth region. Therefore, that gesture has drastically reduced youths’ restiveness and gradually bringing down the issue of carrying up arms against the state.”
