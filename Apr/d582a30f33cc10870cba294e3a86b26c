Despite criticisms that trailed the participation of eight-month pregnant Aminat Idrees at the 20th National Sports Festival Edo 2020, the Technical Director of the Nigeria Taekwondo Federation Chika Chukwumerije has given her a clean bill, adding the athlete did not infringe on any World Taekwondo (WT) competition rules. The Olympian said the World Taekwondo Medical code did not exempt a pregnant woman from participating but such prerogative resides with the medical staff to withdraw such an athlete if not certified fit. He explained “Aminat Idrees is an elite athlete that has practiced poomsae forms for most of her life and competes regularly. She got married during the period of constant postponement of the NSF and subsequently got pregnant. “Throughout the period, she kept on training consistently, as poomsae as a way of life for her. Most certainly, she was active before her pregnancy and has remained active throughout her pregnancy.” Article 1.5.5 of the Olympic Movement Medical Code clearly stated among other things that: “Athletes have the right to be treated with dignity in accordance with their culture, tradition and values.” “I publicly congratulate Aminat Idrees for not only competing in the poomsae event of the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival, but winning a trilogy of medals; including a gold, silver and bronze medal. “She must have worked hard for this result, in a sport event that she clearly loves. I wish her a successful delivery even as she celebrates her remarkable achievement.”
