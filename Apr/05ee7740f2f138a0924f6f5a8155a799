A coalition of non-governmental organisations, under the aegis of the National Action on Sugar Reduction (NASR), have urged the Federal Government to increase the tax on sugar-sweetened beverages such as carbonated sugary drinks and energy drinks, which are known to cause chronic diseases like diabetes, stroke, heart disease, etc. It noted that asides a Euromonitor report which ranks Nigeria as the 4th highest consumer of soft drinks in the world, the high cost for healthcare would mean that many people who can afford to buy soft drinks cannot afford to treat the chronic diseases associated with drinking them. It also urged the National Assembly to introduce a tax on sugary drinks to provide a more lasting solution, which in turn will also provide much-needed revenue to subsidise diabetes treatment costs and control of other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Representing the coalition, Omei Bongos-Ikwue, made these known in a statement duly signed by Diabetes Association of Nigeria, Nutrition Society of Nigeria, Nigeria Cancer Society, Breast Without Spot, Lafiya Wealth Initiative, TalkHealth9ja, Nigeria Health Watch, Project PINK BLUE, Sustainable Development Initiative, and African Youth Initiative on Population, Health and Development (AfrYPoD). It said: “A single soft drink bottle contains staggering amounts of sugar – up to 12 cubes. Soft drinks are also a major contributing factor to tooth decay and obesity, a risk factor for a host of chronic diseases. It is a significant cause of premature death in people under 40 years. NCDs have the chilling capacity to cut lives short in their prime. This is a setback to economic productivity. “In Nigeria, the cost of diabetes care amounts to $4.5 billion per annum. These expenses come to nearly N37,000 a month – more than half of an average Nigerian’s monthly earnings of N60,000. This also amounts to more than ten times the budgetary allocation for health per citizen.”
