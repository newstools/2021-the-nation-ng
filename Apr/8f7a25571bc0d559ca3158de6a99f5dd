The two candidates vying for zonal chairmanship of Southwest Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are trading blames over invasion by suspected political thugs into the venue of the congress on Sunday. The Nation learnt about 10 suspected thugs were arrested with pump action guns and other weapons by security operatives on Sunday after they invaded WOCDIF Event Centre where the PDP congress is holding. A former Oyo Deputy Governor Taofeek Arapaja and contesant alleged the arrested thugs were from the camp of Olafeso. He said: “Those who were arrested were linked to one of the Olafeso’s camp. I don’t want to mention names. We are the agents that want to bring peoples together so I won’t involve in such. “I am positive that I will win this election. If I win I will bring unity to the party. We have several factions in the party which must be addressed.” However, Dr Eddy Olafeso, who is from the camp of former Ekiti Governor, Ayodele Fayose, expressed disappointment over the incident. He said: “So far so good, apart from the invasion of the venue by some thugs yesterday, but thank God the security operatives were able to book it in the bud. “Apart from that everything is calm, we must be able to realise that this is a family affair. One of the cornerstones of democracy is to be able to vote or be voted for and I am excited that this is happening. “As we have started very well I hope it will end well. The process so far, delegates accreditation is ongoing after which agents would be accredited. “Our Constitution recognises an open secret ballot system and nothing less should happen.”
