Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) troops have foiled a kidnap attempt on Gidan Waya-Jagindi Road in Jema’a council area of Kaduna State. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said the troops rescued Ibrahim Tafida from kidnappers after bandits opened fire on his vehicle, forcing it to a stop. He said the bandits abandoned their mission and fled into the bush upon sighting the approaching troops. Aruwan also said troops, in conjunction with the Special Forces of the Nigerian Air Force, rescued  two herders from attack in Mabuhu village of Zangon Kataf Local Government Area, and recovered 200 cattle. The herders were reportedly attacked while grazing their cattle in the village. The troops responded to a distress call and rescued both herders with their 200 cattle. “On a sad note, troops discovered the body of one Jafaru Isah in the bushes beside a river in Farin Hawan village, Jema’a local government area,” Aruwan said.
