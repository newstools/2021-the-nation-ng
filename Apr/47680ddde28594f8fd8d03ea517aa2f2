 Italian legend Salvatore Bagni believes the Serie A is yet to witness the qualities possessed by Victor Osimhen  following the Nigerian resurgence recently. Bagni, a former Napoli midfielder , said  Osimhen  was getting back his form after netting in the last two games for Napoli in the Serie A and seemed to have overcome  initial challenges since   joining  the Serie A  side from Lille of France. “I love him(Osimhen),” Bagni told Corriere del Mezzogiorno. I know him very well, having followed him in the past years. “ He continued: “He has grown up, has great qualities. Now he has passed the limits. “Three phases: at the beginning there was great euphoria, then the discomfort for the injury, COVID and also the pressure and expectations given how much he was paid. Now he has recovered and this is his normality “. Meanwhile, ahead of this weekend’s Serie A tie between Napoli and league leader Inter Milan, Daniele Doveri has been named as the centre referee of the Serie A matchday 31 on Sunday April 18 at the Estadio Diego Armando Maradona. Doveri will be assisted by Costanzo and Ranghetti as linesmen and Marini as Fourth Official. Mazzoleni will be in charge of VAR with Paganessi as his assistant. Doveri has refereed Inter four times this season during their 1-1 draw with Atalanta and the wins against Juventus and AC Milan.
