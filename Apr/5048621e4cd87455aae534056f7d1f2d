 In a bid to encourage women’s aspirations and career ahead the 2023 general elections, a private organisation, ElectHER in collaboration with African Women on Board (AWB) and AGS Tribe hope to launch a $1million crowdfund tagged, ‘WomenForWomen Fund’ and urged women home and abroad on amplifying women’s leadership across sectors. Speaking at the Women for Women conference in Lagos, the groups hinted that it was already in discussion with some of the banks and other financial institutions including Platform Capital Group, One Women by Sterling Bank, GAIA Africa and Auroe scents. A key highlight of the conference was the historical launch of a first of its kind collaborative fund, The WomenforWomen Fund, a crowdfunding initiative led by a collective of three women’s organization – ElectHER, African Women on Board, and AGS Tribe, with a goal to raise $1 million from Nigerian women home and abroad, for fellow women seeking to run for elective offices in 2023. The fund is a sub-fund under ElectHER’s Agender35 campaign- which has an overarching goal to raise a $10 million fund to empower 1000 women to Decide to Run and directly fund 35 women to competitively run for elective office in the forthcoming Nigerian general elections. The Co-founder and Executive Director of ElectHER, Ibijoke Faborode stated that the WomenforWomen Fund matters, saying it is a collective call to encourage multiple female stakeholders to get onboard and put their money where their mouth is. According to her, as women become more empowered and take on leadership positions across the private sector and lead large business ventures, it is indeed time for the girl’s club to step it up. In her view, Abosede George-Ogan, who also Co-founded ElectHER, noted that US organizations like Emily’s list have raised over $600 million to support thousands of pro-choice women to run for offices adding that it is time to start building a similar funding base in Nigeria for women who will represent the interest of women and girls in political leadership positions. George-Ogan hinted that the unregulated growing costs of running elections in Nigeria, financial inclusion and the risk process of running and mobilise more for political leadership is more crucial than ever. In her own reaction, the chairperson African Women on Board (AWB) Nkiru Balonwu bemoaned the lack of funding and campaign support as key factors that limit the political ambitions of women.
