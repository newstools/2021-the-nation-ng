 Joining the list of women taking up leadership positions across the globe, Bukola Smith is gradually towing the path of greatness. Having done brilliantly well for herself, Smith has been tasked with a new leadership challenge as she assumes the position of the Chief Executive and Managing Director of FSDH Merchant bank Limited. Though she’s not a rookie in the finance world – she has held top positions in the past – this new hurdle will test her abilities and leadership qualities. Smith’s record includes giant strides that saw the bank’s SME-focused team move from the fifth position in the industry to the first position in 2019 (KPMG Customer Service Report 2020) within three years under her watch. With her intimidating resume and her track records in the corporate firmament, armed with strategic execution cum leadership skills, and backed by the apex governing body of finance in Nigeria, Smith was announced as Hamda Ambah, the outgoing Managing Director and CEO’s replacement.  Smith’s academic credentials speak volumes. She holds a B.Sc in Economics from the University of Lagos, an MBA from Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, U.K. She is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), an Honorary Member of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, and an Associate Member of, Certified Institute of Pensions (Nigeria). Before now, Smith was appointed executive director -business development at First City Monument Bank (FCMB) in 2017 and held several other leadership positions since she joined FCMB in 2006. Under her leadership, she established the FCMB Women in Business Desk (branded SheVentures) which supports female entrepreneurs. She also set up FCMB Trustees and FCMB Custody, both of which broke even in the first year of operations and are building traction in the asset management field.
