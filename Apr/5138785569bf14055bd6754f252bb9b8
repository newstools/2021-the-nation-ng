 Three-time African champions Super Eagles will most likely be seeded for the 2021 AFCON draw on June 25. The Eagles were unbeaten as they won Group L with 14 points, while the second ticket in that group will be decided between Benin and Sierra Leone in June. Nigeria finished third at the last edition in Egypt two years ago and their past records in the competition will be used to seed them, which in turn will see them head one of the first round groups.  Twenty three teams have so far qualified for the tournament to be staged by Cameroon between January 9 to February 6, 2022. Champions in 1996 South Africa are one of the top teams who failed to make it to the tournament proper, while the little island of Comoros will be among the debutants.
