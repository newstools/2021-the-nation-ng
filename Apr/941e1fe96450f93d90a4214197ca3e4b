  Roger Federer  has confirmed  he will play the French Open at Roland Garros this year having skipped the 2020 edition to recover from knee surgery. “Hi everyone! Happy to let you know that I will play Geneva and Paris. Until then I will use the time to train. Can’t wait to play in Switzerland again,” the 39-year-old said on Twitter. Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam winner, captured Roland Garros for the only time in 2009. His last appearance in the French capital in 2019 ended in a semi-final loss to Rafael Nadal, now a 13-time champion. Should Nadal triumph again in June, he will win a record-setting 21st major.  Federer, who will turn 40 in August, has played just one tournament in 2021, winning one match in Qatar in March on his return from 13 months on the sidelines after undergoing two bouts of knee surgeries. He had been intending to return to action on clay in Madrid from May 2 but will now have his only pre-Paris warm-up in Geneva from May 16.Roland Garros will start on May 30, a week later than originally scheduled. Federer, with 103 career titles to his name, has not won a tour clay title since Istanbul in 2015. For the great Swiss, his two major objectives in 2021 are an assault on a ninth Wimbledon crown and a gold medal in singles at the Tokyo Olympics.
