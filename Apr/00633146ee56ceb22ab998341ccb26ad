The Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba on Thursday ordered immediate disbandment of the IGP Monitoring Units in Lagos and Port Harcourt. Baba gave the order in Abuja at the opening of a conference of Police Strategic Commanders, consisting of officers with the rank of Commissioner of Police (CP) and above. He also ordered the streamlining of the personnel profile of the IGP Monitoring Unit at the Force Headquarters to not more than 50 operatives. Baba announced the banning of the unit from undertaking criminal investigations, including taking over of cases from Police Commands in States. According to him, under the current dispensation, the unit will only operate within their original mandate, which is to investigate complaints of alleged professional infractions against serving officers. Baba said the directives were in furtherance to the reorganisation plans of the force and its commitment to return to the basics in policing. He said the repositioning initiatives were being worked out in relation to other ad-hoc investigative units in the force. The police boss said the idea was to restore professionalism, address citizensâ€™ concerns on rights abuses resulting from the existence and operations of the ad-hoc investigation units. Baba said it was also to discourage duplication of police functions that encouraged indiscipline and abuse of police processes.
