 Mikel Arteta has ruled out making a move for departing Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero this summer. Aguero, City’s all-time record goal scorer, has so far won four Premier League titles, an FA Cup, and five League Cups during his decade-long stay at the Etihad Stadium. Arteta has looked to promote youth since his arrival as Arsenal manager, with current forwards Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette among their most experienced players. Aguero is widely remembered for his injury-time goal in the final game of the 2011-12 season, his debut campaign, against QPR which secured City’s first Premier League title.
