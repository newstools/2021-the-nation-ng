The Edo State Government said it may be forced to stop the ongoing 20th National Sports Festival (NSF) if the Federal Government does not fulfill its counterpart fund of the games. Project Manager, Media & Communications of Edo 2020, Ebomhiana Musa, in a statement on behalf of the Local Organising Committee, said the decision to end the games was due to paucity of funds. The statement reads :”The Local Organising Cittee, Edo2020 regrets to announce that it will end the games abruptly tomorrow, Thursday, April 8, 2021 for lack of funds. “Rising from an emergency meeting this evening, the LOC says it has to take this hard decision due to lack of funds having expended its reserves to kick start the games. “Regrettably, the FG is yet to redeem its pledge to support us as the host state financially for the cost of postponements. So, we are left with no option than to end the games at noon tomorrow.” The NSF was to hold almost a year ago but suffered several postponements due to outbreak of COVID-19. The NSF was officially declared open on Tuesday amid pomp and ceremony with some events already decided as at Wednesday night.
