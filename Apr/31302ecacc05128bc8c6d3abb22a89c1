Some residents of Surulere Local Government Area of Lagos have warned the council legislators to stop the propose impeachment of the Chairman, Tajudeen Ajide. According to them, not every misunderstanding should result to impeachment process. A civil servant who spoke with our reporter at Masha, Mrs Bola Ogunye, urged the feuding parties to resolve their matter amicably. Mrs Ogunye said impeachment is not a solution to the crisis. Olu Adeyemi, an engineer on Census Close, wondered why the councillors would think of impeachment when the tenure of the council chairman will end in July. Adeyemi urged the lawmakers not to distract the chairman and allow him complete ongoing projects in the council including the hospital. “The man has done well. Since, I have been living in this area, no local government chairman deemed it fit to fix our road. We are always at the mercy of flood during the raining season, but this man fixed it with good drainage,” he said. Smart Okorodudu urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders in Surulere to wade into the matter. Okorodudu said the issue should be resolved within the party.
