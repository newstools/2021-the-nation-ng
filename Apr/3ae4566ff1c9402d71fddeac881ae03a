The Federal Government would soon unveil an enhanced salary package and conditions of service for judges in the country, Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has said. This, he said, was part of government’s efforts to support the Judiciary to enable it effectively discharge its constitutional duties and sustain the nation’s democracy. Malami noted the Judiciary remains a strong catalyst for sustaining democracy, through its “protection of our democratic principles, such as the enforcement of rules of law, promotion of checks-and-balances, preservation of the principles of separation of powers, and proactive judicial activisms become the bedrocks for sustainable democracy.” He spoke in Sokoto on Monday while commissioning the re-modelled Sokoto State High Court complex. Malami, who emphasised the importance of an independence judiciary in every democracy, noted with the last amendment to the Constitution and the Executive Order 10, the issue of financial autonomy for state judiciary and legislature ought not to be negotiable. He noted that the decision by the Sokoto State Government to remodel the High Court was an indication of Governor Aminu Tambuwal’s support for Federal Government’s efforts to ensure financial autonomy for the Judiciary and Legislature at the state level. Incidentally, Tambuwals currently chairs the sub-committee set up by the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) for the implementation of Executive Order 10 and related constitutional provisions on financial autonomy for state Judiciary and Legislature.
