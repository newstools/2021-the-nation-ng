Anthony Joshua’s undisputed clash with Tyson Fury will fall on one of three dates – and will be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The heavyweight world champions signed a contract for the £200million mega-fight last month, without knowing where or when it would take place. But the rivals both opted for Saudi Arabia when presented with four offers by promoter Eddie Hearn last week. And Fury’s promoter Bob Arum confirmed the fight will take place in a 20,000-capacity indoor arena in the Saudi port town with July 24, 31 and August 7 the three potential dates. “It’s going to have to be within the next 10 days, maybe two weeks,” Arum told Boxing Scene. “It’s a massive economic deal. “We have (site) contracts now that we are marking up and so forth. It’s a big step; we’re just doing the paperwork now with the Saudis.” Arum also confirmed that both BT Sport and Sky Sports will show the fight on pay-per-view in the UK, likely at a cost of £29.95, and the bout will air at prime time for British fight fans. The fight will be streamed on ESPN+ pay-per-view in the United States. Joshua and Fury agreed a 50/50 purse split last year with the winner of the first fight earning 60 per cent of the purse for a second fight due to be held in the UK in December. Since then Fury has appeared the more reluctant to believe a deal could be stuck in the middle of a global pandemic.
