Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni has sought more military support from the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Leo Irabor, to quell Boko Haram attacks. The meeting took place at the official residence of the CDS in Abuja on Sunday evening at the instance of the governor, following the attack on Geidam. The Director-General, Press and Media Affairs to the governor, Malam Mamman Mohammed, in a statement in Abuja, shortly after the two leaders met, said Buni had since Friday been liaising with the security authorities to find a lasting solution to the incessant attacks on Geidam and the border communities. Mohammed said Buni’s move was informed by the urgent need to find a permanent solution to further intrusion of the insurgents into the state. “The problem we have is the movement of the insurgents from the fringes of Lake Chad into the state. We need to check this holistically to proffer a permanent solution to the menace,” he said. The governor lamented that the people of Geidam had been subjected to several attacks and untold hardships that must be checked. “As a leader, l have to explore all avenues, including meeting the Chief of Defence Staff and the service chiefs to ensure the safety and security of the people of Geidam and the state at large,” Buni said.
