The Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) has justified decision by its representatives to abandon a scheduled meeting with Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige on Tuesday. JUSUN’s National Treasurer, Jimoh Musa, said the group’s representatives left the meeting venue after waiting for about two hours without the Minister turning up for the meeting planned for 3pm. The Minister had met with the striking court workers and other stakeholders last Tuesday, following which a follow-up meeting was scheduled for Thursday to await the outcome of the meeting of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) slated for Wednesday. The scheduled follow-up meeting however did not hold last Thursday, prompting JUSUN to resort to the protest held nationwide on Monday. Jimoh told The Nation the JUSUN secretariat was informed late on Sunday, after the protest had been planned, that the meeting with the Labour Minister would now hold on Tuesday at 3pm. He said JUSUN’s representatives arrived the meeting venue before 3pm but had to leave upon waiting endlessly for the Minister. Jimoh said: “Yes, we were at the place. We were supposed to meet by 3pm and we were there before 3pm. “We waited for the Minister. They were inside (the Minister and some others), but we don’t know what they were doing inside. “They just kept us there, no courtesy to tell us what was going on. All our guests, including lawyers, were there, but no news from them for almost two hours. “They kept us for over an hour and thirty minutes or more and most of my members ran out of patience so we had to walk out. “We are resolute on the decision that we have taken.This strike will remain until the governors resolve to obey the Constitution.”
