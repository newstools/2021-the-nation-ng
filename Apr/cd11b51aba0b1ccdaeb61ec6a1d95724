The development of the relevant application to attend to the needs of people is one way to address the youth unemployment in the country, a firm, Roaddo App has said. Its founder, Roaddo App, Fred Adun, who spoke during the unveiling of Roaddo, a digital ecosystem which connects buyers and sellers and also offers instant delivery of goods and services, said the app is conceived to ensure the convenience of the shopper and to unlock market access to the sellers and service providers. He said the app which will go live on April 6, said aside the convenient shopping experience for buyers, the app will also address widespread youth unemployment by giving Nigerians a platform where they can leverage their skills to sustainably earn a living. Adun said: “In addition to unlocking market access, Roaddo had also leveraged technology to affordably make a variety of on-demand services; including cab rides, hourly help, beauty services and artisans readily available to Nigerians.” With over 60 products and services available on the app, the shopper with an uncompromising eye for quality is assured of convenience, ease of access and prompt delivery to preferred locations, thereby elevating the shopping experience. He said: “Roaddo, a wholly Nigerian brand offers buyers a chance to shop from the comfort of their homes and have the items delivered within one hour.” “With our network of partners and service providers, our commitment is to ease logistic challenges encountered by buyers as well as to offer prompt and efficient delivery of goods and services. When life gets busier, get back some “me time” with the Roaddo; a multiple on-demand services app,” Adun said. With the current public health challenge, Roaddo app is a timely solution to ensure exposure to crowded spaces remain limited while goods and services remain readily accessible to buyers.
