Former BBNaija housemate Erica Ngozi Nlewedim, popularly known as Erica, has played an April fool prank on his fans and admirers. She claimed to have acquired a magnificent new house in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The actress was gifted a beautiful house in one of the choicest area of the metropolitan city, Lagos by her fans “The Elites” to mark her 26th birthday last month. The Star girl, as she is also known, posted her ‘second’ house, displaying the beautiful architectural work on April 1. The caption for the beautiful house portrayed immense delight and gratitude to God and her fans for her new achievement. She wrote: “2021 has been amazing I just want to thank God, I got my second house in Abuja. This post is to let you know that if you can dream it you can do it, and you should set a goal so you can live a life above reproach and you will not be treated like a cockroach. “This journey for me started from a desire and I perspired, and I acquired houses, the journey required a lot of pictures of my future straight from the scriptures!  “Thanks to all my beautiful Elites and Kiddricans and all supporters with every other name! I love you and please tell the real owner of the house I’m not trying to steal their house o! “It’s just because it’s the first day of the fourth month of the year and they usually do something’s to celebrate it! So let’s celebrate and have a nice housewarming party!” However, the post apparently has got quite a number of her fans fooled as they have kept sending in congratulatory messages.
