 The Nigerian Army are yet to confirm the alleged shooting by unknown gunmen of two soldiers at a military checkpoint located at popular Timber Shade junction in Amasiri, Afikpo North local government area of Ebonyi. Meanwhile, a top security source, who confirmed the incident on Tuesday at Amasiri on condition of anonymity, said that the shooting occured on Monday night around 9.pm. The source stated that the gunmen made away with the riffles of the two dead soldiers. Also, a source in the community, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) and pleaded not to be mentioned said the gunmen arrived the checkpoint in a white bus and as the military men stopped them for a stop-and-search, they opened fire on them. According to the source, the situation jolted the two busy towns of Amasiri and Afikpo into pandemonium, as residents, especially traders and shop owners hurriedly closed down shops and went home. “It’s a very sad situation here. They said it was people suspected to be gunmen, who came to the checkpoint at Timber Shade (boundary Ehugbo and Amasiri) in a white bus,” the source said. All efforts to speak with military officials at the Nkwegu military cantonment proved abortive. An officer told NAN on condition of anonymity that the army Headquarters would release a statement at the appropriate time. Also, an army assistant Public Relations Officer simply identified as Tayo when contacted on his mobile phone (08038432656) said that he would get back to NAN. Also contacted, Mrs Loveth Odah, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) declined to speak on the incident saying that she was not spokesperson for the army. “I am not the military spokesperson, please contact the military public relations officer so that he can answer that,” Odah said.
