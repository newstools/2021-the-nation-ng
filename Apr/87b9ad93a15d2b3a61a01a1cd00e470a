The Chief Executive, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Demola Sogunle has said  youths constitute over 50 percent of Nigeria’s population hence the need to prioritise harnessing their potential for sustained growth. He spoke at the Youth Leadership Series (YLS) in Lagos. He said the youth required support, guidance and empowerment to take them to the top of their fields. “The innovative projects and tech disruptions championed by the youth in virtually every sector are proof of their ingenuity, skill, brilliance and resourcefulness. At Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, we believe in breaking boundaries, hence our tagline, IT CAN BE, which is hinged upon the premise that everything is possible as long as we are dedicated and put in requisite effort to make it work,” he said. The theme of the event is: ‘Winning’. Sogunle reiterated the financial institution’s dedication to creating opportunities for future leaders. He said: “It is important to ensure that the youth are adequately empowered to excel. This is why we have decided to continue to empower them with the knowledge required to prepare them for the long and possibly strenuous journey ahead. “This year’s line-up of speakers will engage the younger generation on various issues that concern business ownership and entrepreneurship, as well as what it takes to ‘win’, especially in the ever-changing business landscape.”
