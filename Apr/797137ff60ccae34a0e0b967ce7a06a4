 It was a night of glitz and glam as Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi’s ‘Ige – The Unlikely Oil Merchant,’ premiered amidst fun-fair at the iMax cinema, Lekki, on April 3. The premiere witnessed society heavyweights from various works of life. Dignitaries present at the event include the wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, Ooni Of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Oba Saheed Elegushi, Oba Abdulwasiu Omogbolahan Lawal, and a host of others. ‘Ige,’ a biopic of Nigerian oil magnate Bashir Fakorede, who rose to the top of his chosen field against all odds premiered on the 50 years birthday of his wife, Tayo Fakorede.  The film’s script is an adaptation of Fakorede’s biography written by Mrs. Fakorede when the oil magnate turned 50 two years ago. Speaking at the premiere of the movie in Lagos, Mrs. Fakorode said the idea for the movie was borne out of the passion to pass a message across to youths who think life is like a bed of roses. “The movie is to encourage the youths and teach them that hard works and determination pays and that most successful people don’t just wake up in a day and become rich, there is always a story behind those successes”, said Yeye Fakorede.
