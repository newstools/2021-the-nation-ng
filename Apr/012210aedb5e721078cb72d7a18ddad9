Efe Ajagba started his 2021 fight debut with a bang on Saturday night, stopping Brian Howard with a dangerous right hand to the ear in round 3 of their heavyweight clash, to add another knockout record to his professional boxing career. It was the 12th knockout win in 15 fights for the former Olympian since he turned pro in 2017. The Nigerian timed Howard and countered him with the right hand for a vicious 3rd Round KO leaving the 40 year-old sprawled on the canvas in front of a sold-out crowd at Osage Casino in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “It feels really good,” Ajagba said after the fight. “I listened to the corner, they told me to start to the body & then go to the head. When I started with the jab to the body, it caused him to drop his hands. Then came the right hand.” he added.
