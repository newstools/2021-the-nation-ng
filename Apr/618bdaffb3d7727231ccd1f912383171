Gunmen have killed two sons of the Ovie (King) of Orhumwhorun Community in Udu Local Government Area, HRH, Ighohwo Takerere, Okaka II. Two policemen in their vehicles were also gunned in Effurun, Uvwie LGA during the attack on Saturday afternoon. The princes were shot dead inside their two newly acquired exotic SUVs – Range Rover and Mercedes Benz GLK (EPE 289 FB). The policemen were said to be in the front passenger’s seats of the cars when they were shot. Another young man whose identity was not immediately known was also killed. The cars were splattered with blood of the victims but eyewitnesses said nothing was taken from them, leading to speculations the killings were cult or failed business deals related. Their gruesome murder sparked off wild protests, lootings and destruction spree in the Usiefurun area of Orhumworun on Saturday night. A report that someone was killed in the mayhem could not be independently confirmed. Not less than three cars were damaged and looted by recalcitrant youths of the area allegedly protesting death of the princes.
