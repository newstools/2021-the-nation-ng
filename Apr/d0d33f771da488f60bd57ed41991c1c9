The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) membership registration/revalidation and update exercise have been extended by another three weeks. The extension is coming less than 24 hours after the Forum of State Chairmen appealed to the party leadership to extend the exercise to accommodate more intending members to the party. The exercise, which started on February 9 in Daura, Kastina State, was earlier extended by four weeks which ended on Thursday, March 31st, 2021. The decision to this effect was contained in a statement by the Secretary of the party’s Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe in Abuja on Thursday. According to the statement, the extension was approved due to reports from the National Membership Registration, Revalidation and Update Committee; States’ Registration Committees and the Situation Room which indicated most states for varied reasons, started late, and require additional time to conclude the exercise. The party also hinged the extension on the avalanche of applications from critical stakeholders (including all States Caretaker Chairmen) for an extension of time to capture Nigerians who are still desirous of joining the fold of the progressives. “The Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) under the leadership of His Excellency, Hon. Mai Mala Buni had done everything possible to keep to the earlier timeline, however, it has become imperative to extend the duration of this very important party activity. “Consequently, the CECPC has approved the recommendation of the National Committee for the Membership Registration, Revalidation and Update to extend the duration of the exercise for three weeks.”
