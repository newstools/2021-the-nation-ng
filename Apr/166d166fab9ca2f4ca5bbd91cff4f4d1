Total Exploration and Production (E&P) Nigeria Limited in joint efforts with the Federal Government contributed N1.2 billion ($3.2m) to fight the Covid-19 global pandemic.  The company at an interactive session (virtual) with the media explained that it made massive interventions because it believed that Nigeria was a home and liked to identify with communities where it operated. The Executive Director, Corporate Affairs and Services, Mr. Abiodun Afolabi who led the session said that Total was keen on the sustainability of projects and its interventions, hence the company preferred to complete programmes and projects before talking about them. “Total’s contribution was $3.2m (N1.2b). From the N1.2b contribution, Total is building two Emergency and Infectious Diseases (EID) Hospitals, one each in Maiduguri and Katsina, in addition to two Diagnostics Centres, one each in Minna and Damaturu,” Afolabi said, adding that this was followed by similar contributions to states. “Realising that the challenges brought about by the pandemic could potentially worsen the situation of persons living with HIV/AIDS, we reached out to the Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria, NEPHWAN in Lagos with foodstuff, sanitary products and the much-needed antiretroviral drugs,” the Executive General Manager, Operations Support Services, Mr Alex Aghedo explained in an incisive presentation on the company’s interventions towards taming the pandemic, in Nigeria. In his remarks, moderator of the session and the Country Communication Manager, Dr. Charles Ebereonwu noted that while the company had done a lot in assisting various levels of government to fight against the pandemic, it was telling the stories to inspire others to also contribute their quota towards improving lives.
