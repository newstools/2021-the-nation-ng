Aymeric Laporte was the unlikely hero as Manchester City saw off a resilient Tottenham to lift the Carabao Cup for the fourth consecutive season. However, the City defender arguably should have sent off but was booked for only one of two cynical fouls in the first half before he scored from Kevin De Bruyne’s free-kick delivery in the 82nd minute. Eight thousand supporters were welcomed to Wembley and witnessed a totally one-sided first half, as City peppered Tottenham’s goal but could not find a way through thanks to a combination of last-ditch desperate defending and an impressive Hugo Lloris performance.  The best chance fell to Phil Foden whose effort was deflected onto the post by Toby Alderweireld, but the out-of-form Raheem Sterling – who was handed a rare start – also went close, seeing a goal bound shot blocked by the leg of Eric Dier while Riyad Mahrez fired agonisingly over and Lloris tipped a Cancelo effort wide. However, City were fortunate that Laporte was only yellow carded for one of two cynical fouls, as Tottenham kept it compact and tried to hit their opponents on the break.
