The All Progressives Congress (APC) has charged Nigerians to dedicate themselves to more prayers during Easter to seek divine intervention and guidance for the country’s leaders. The Governor of Borno State, Mai Mala Buni, who is also the Chairman APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), gave the charge in a statement yesterday in Abuja. A statement by Alhaji Mamman Mohammed, Buni’s Director- General, Press and Media, said Buni also called for love, unity, peace, harmony and tolerance among Nigerians. He called on religious leaders to use the occasion of Easter to preach peace, tolerance and unity among Nigerians. Buni said the Easter period should be used to pray for Nigeria to overcome its challenges and for its prosperity. “As people of faith, we should dedicate ourselves to more prayers during the Easter to seek divine intervention and guide our leaders right,” he said.
