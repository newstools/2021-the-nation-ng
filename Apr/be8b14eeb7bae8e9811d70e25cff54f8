Mr Chimaobi Adiele, a lawyer, performed the ceremony.  Nwankwo, who described the day as his most exciting, noted that it was the first time a president of the association would be returned unopposed. He promised not to let the members down. He said in his first three-year term, he restored peace to the market, among other achievements, pledging to ensure that peace continued to reign. He reminded the traders of their objective and the reason they were in Lagos and advised them to support him to achieve these. ‘’We are traders. We left the East to find our daily bread. And I said I would fight for you and for three years Ladipo had been at peace,’’ he said. Immediate past president of the association Elder Kingsley Ogunor scored Nwankwo on performance during his first tenure, adding that this indicated that he didn’t make a mistake when he chose him as his successor. Also, President, Igbo Speaking Community, Lagos State, Chief Cyril Sunday Eze agreed that peace had returned to the market but that Nwankwo should not rest on his oars. Chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT), Humphrey Obiwulu, also spoke in similar vein.
