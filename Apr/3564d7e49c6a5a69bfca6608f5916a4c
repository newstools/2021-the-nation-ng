The Premier League’s official Hall of Fame will kick off on Monday. According to Skysport, the first two inductees will be announced on Monday alongside a shortlist of additional nominees which fans will be able to vote for future inclusion. The event was set to launch in February 2020 but was disrupted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Hall of Fame will recognise and celebrate the exceptional skill and talent of those who have graced the Premier League since its inception in 1992. To be eligible for the Premier League Hall of Fame this year, players must have been retired as of August 2020 and only a player’s Premier League career is considered in his candidacy. “Since 1992, the Premier League has been home to world-class players who have defined generations and provided us with compelling football season after season,” said Richard Masters[Premier League C.E.O]. “A place in the Premier League Hall of Fame is reserved for the very best. It will be an occasion for our fans around the world to look back over the years and help us celebrate some truly exceptional playing careers.” Each inductee will receive a personalised medallion, engraved with the year of their induction. Premier League fans and viewers around the world can look back, take some moments and celebrate some truly exceptional playing careers by Hall of famers.
