The Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) has congratulated teenage table tennis star, Musa Mustapha who was recently ranked world number one in the boys U-11 category by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). In a release signed by the Secretary General of NOC, Olabanji Oladapo stated that the Board and members of the NOC extend warm compliments to the President, members and staff of the Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF) for the achievement of the young lad at the world stage. “The Nigeria Olympic Committee is proud of the rising youngster and we believe that with proper handling, he possesses the potential of a global star player in the future”, Oladapo said.  He added: “On behalf of the President and members of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), we congratulate Master Musa Mustapha and your federation on the outstanding achievement and we implore you to keep on with the good work even as we challenge federations to emulate this feat.” Mustapha made his senior debut at the 2018 Nigeria Open in Lagos and was part of the Nigerian team that won the 2019 ITTF Junior Circuit in Ghana. According to the rankings released by the ITTF, Mustapha has 128 points, which made him number one in the U-11, while he is also ranked 17th in the U-13 category. Mustapha became the second African to be rated number one in the world after Egypt’s Hana Goda was in 2020 named the best U-15 girls in the world.
