The Rivers State Government has stopped a planned meeting of some Igbo residents in the Oyigbo Local Government Area, citing fears that the gathering could spark fresh unrest in the area. The United Igbo community meeting was originally scheduled for today at Oyigbo. Information and Communication Commissioner, Paulinus Nsirim, said government has directed security agencies “to ensure that the said meeting does not hold to forestall a breakdown of law and order in the area.” He did not elaborate on the security concern. Oyigbo local government area shares boundary with Abia State which is considered a stronghold of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The group is being accused of lawlessness in the state and Imo.
