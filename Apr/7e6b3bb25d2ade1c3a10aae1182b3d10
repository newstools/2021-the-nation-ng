A patrol team of the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) has rescued a pedestrian injured in a hit-and-run incident on the Eti-Osa-Lekki-Epe Expressway, Lagos. It was gathered that the incident happened at about 7am on Tuesday along the Jakande end of the highway and that the unidentified vehicle fled after the incident. Officers of LCC’s Patrol Team near the area mobilised to the scene and administered first aid on the man, who could only identify himself as Sylva. The LCC’s Incident and Security Teams then stabilised the victim and transferred him to the Lagos Island General Hospital with an ambulance provided by the Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS) at about 9:45am. Commenting on the incident, LCC Managing Director of the LCC, Yomi Omomuwasan, said the company paid the victim’s hospital bill, as part of its social corporate responsibility. Omomuwasan said, “We feel it is the least we can do for the innocent victim who is in severe pain. We also want to assure every road user of essential services along the axis, including free 24/7 emergency assistance, vehicle breakdown and recovery services and security patrol to all road users plying the Eti-Osa Lekki-Epe Expressway.” LCC’s Head of Route and Incident, Michael Aina, credited the patrol team’s timely intervention for saving the injured man. Aina said the team is always available to help distressed road users. He advised drivers to always observe the speed limit on the road. He added: “The LCC makes it a point of duty to routinely ensure commuters’ safety and security along the Eti-Osa Lekki-Epe Express Way. It is one of the company’s core responsibilities aside from the construction and maintenance of infrastructure along the axis.”
