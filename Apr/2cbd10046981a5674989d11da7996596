There is apprehension in Ameta-Ozizza, Afikpo North Local Area of Ebonyi State over a suspected plan by herders to attack residents of the community. The anxiety began building hours after herdsmen killed 25 people in Egedegede and two other communities in Ishielu council area nine days ago. A prominent source told The Nation on Tuesday that Ameta-Ozizza youths, on sighting a large number of herders on their farmland, beat gongs to put other villagers on the alert but were greeted with gunshots. The source, who said he visited the community with the council chair Oby Okoenyim, shortly after the alarm was raised, dismissed speculations that two people were killed. “I don’t think anyone died but I can confirm that the herders shot their way out of the village on that Monday. As I speak to you, there is apprehension amongst the people. They fear that the herdsmen might launch an attack on them for daring to stop them from grazing their cattle,” he added.
