The return date of President Muhammadu Buhari from his medical check-up trip to the United Kingdom (UK) remains unknown as at Wednesday. When State House Correspondents on Wednesday asked the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, to put a date to the expected return of the President the query was sidestepped. The Minister just retorted: “Today is Wednesday, this week finishes on Saturday. So, what’s the big issue in that one?” According to him, the government was more concerned with insecurity bedeviling the country. Buhari on Tuesday, March 30, 2021, left Abuja for the UK for a routine medical checkup. The Presidency explained that he is expected to return to Abuja this week. In a statement to announce the planned departure, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, had said Buhari would be back in the country in the second week of April 2021. “He is due back in the country during the second week of April 2021,” the statement said.
