A third-year Accounting student of the Niger Delta University, Amassoma, Bayelsa State has been taken into custody in connection with the killing of a student at a lecture hall on Wednesday. African Innocent was arrested yesterday 24 hours after James Okunmakpeye was shot in the head at point-blank range while standing at the door of a lecture hall. His killer reportedly fled through a breached fence. Okunmakpeye’s course mates and their lecturer scampered for safety, leaving his body in a pool of blood. Police spokesman Asinim Butswat said the suspect was in custody, adding that the command had deployed operatives in the school. Butswat stated: “When our teams were alerted, we responded swiftly and one suspect, African Innocent, a 300-level Accounting undergraduate of the institution was arrested. He is now in custody.”
