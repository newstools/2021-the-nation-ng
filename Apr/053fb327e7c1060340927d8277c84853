Nollywood actress, Charity Eke, popularly known as Chacha Eke Fanni, has welcomed a child with her husband, Austine Faani amid reports of crashed marriage due to domestic violence. Chacha had in a viral video announced her marriage to her husband had ended. Although the actress did not give details of what led to the end of her marriage, she only noted she was leaving the 7-year-old union while still alive. This led to the rumours she suffered domestic violence in the marriage. Following the development, the actress in a video denied claims that her husband beats her. She further stated that she was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, which was attributed to her pregnancy for which she was receiving treatment at a hospital in Delta State. However, the actress on Saturday took to her Instagram account to announce that the family had welcomed a baby girl. She posted a picture of the little one with the caption which happened to be a repost from the husband’s page; “Beloved, Our Baby Is Here • • •Repost from @austinfaani I AM THE ONE THE LORD HAS TREMENDOUSLY BLESSED.
