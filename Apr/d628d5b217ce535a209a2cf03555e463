 A political group, the South West Agenda (SWAGA 23), has said it did not get the approval of former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to begin presidential campaign for him. The group, which comprises former lawmakers and political associates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, said it began the campaign to get its presence in all polling units across the country. SWAGA 23 National Chairman, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, spoke yesterday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, at the inauguration of the state chapter of the group, headed by former Secretary to Ondo State Government (SSG), Ifedayo Abegunde. Adeyeye said: “The National Leader of the ruling APC, Asiwaju Tinubu, has not informed any member of the group that he has interest in the election.  “We opted for Tinubu to present the best candidate for the election in the South. We want all of Yoruba to rally round him in order to have a more viable front to clinch the Presidency.” A former Vice Chairman of Exxon Mobil, Otunba Solomon Oladunni, called for an inclusive economy that would catalyse other sectors for development and prosperity for Nigerians. Oladunni, who called for an enabling environment for private establishments to thrive, said Nigeria’s economy has been in comatose for decades, stalling its growth and development in all facets. Head of Akwa Ibom Stakeholders for Tinubu, Eseme Eyiboh, said the support for the APC stalwart’s presidency cuts across the country.
