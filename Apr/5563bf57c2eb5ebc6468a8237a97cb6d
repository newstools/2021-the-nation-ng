A former Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) President, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) has admonished the rich to cultivate the spirit of giving to the less-privileged as a way to reduce national poverty. Olanipekun, who lamented the hardship many Nigerians face coupled with the economic instability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, said helping help the poor was for the good of all. He spoke in Lagos at the inaugural lecture and launch of an autobiography in honour of a philanthropist and Chief Executive Officer of International Alpha Ltd group of companies, Dr (Mrs) Oluwaseye Yomi-Sholoye. The book, ‘Blessed are the compassionate’ was launched by Energy Traders and Services Ltd technical director, Mr Niyi Afolabi. On why she published the book, Yomi-Sholoye said it was to capture the comfort, laughter, joy, confidence and hope given to the needy who could not pay her back. She called on the well-to-do to support government poverty alleviation programmes to enable the limited resources go round. The highlight of the event was the testimony from beneficiaries of the Yomi-Sholoye Foundation both within and outside the country. One of the beneficiaries who identified herself as Rebecca Michael said; “I call her my comforter because she’s been like a mother to me; paying my school fees and putting smiles on my face. My endless appreciation goes to Yomi-Sholoye for her motherly care.”
