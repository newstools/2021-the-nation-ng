 Tiwa Savage, Burna Boy, and Wizkid are some of Nigeria’s top entertainment celebrities who have been announced as some of the nominees for the maiden edition of the Nigerian Social Media Award. The award ceremony is scheduled to be held on December 11, 2021, at the Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. Competing in the premium category of the award ceremony tagged Naija Game of Thrones are 2Baba, Burna Boy, Tiwa Savage, Wiz Kid, Olamide, Don Jazzy, and Genevieve Nnaji, who were selected from a month-long online survey.  The project manager, Francis Amirize, says the idea to institute a social media award in Nigeria stems from the fact that social media which a few years ago started as a fun spot has today metamorphosed into an opinion-shaping part of existence that can no longer be ignored in the scheme of things in the world. “The Nigerian Social Media Award is a concept whose time is here and you will believe when you look at how the events on social media are shaping perceptions in the world today. The world spends millions of man-hours on social media every day learning, entertaining themselves or others, and conversing. In all these, impressions are being created and perceptions are being formed. So we are looking at the brands, individuals, enterprises, art forms, and events that are making these impacts yearly,” Amirize said.
