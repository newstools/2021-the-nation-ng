The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has challenged security agents to fish out perpetrators of weekend attacks in Abia, Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra and Rivers States. The party also demanded sponsors of the dastardly attacks be made to face the full weight of the law to restore confidence in the system, particularly democratic and security structures. Secretary of the party’s Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, in a statement in Abuja on Monday, condemned the dangerous development. The Secretary said the party has particularly monitored the development in Imo State which culminated in Saturday’s brazen and gruesome attack on the residence of Governor Hope Uzodimma. The party equally condemned the wanton attacks on police personnel and formations in Abia, Imo, Ebonyi and Anambra states as well as Rivers State. Commiserating with families of weekend attacks, Akpanudoedehe said: “We stand with the Nigeria Police Force and families of the victims in this difficult time as we mourn the deaths of innocent and dedicated security personnel simply carrying out their duty of protecting life and property. “In Imo state, the attack on the Governor’s residence is an attack on democracy and constituted authority serving the interest of the good people of Imo state. “While we are still in shock over the ugly turn of events in the state, the party sympathises with Sen. Hope Uzodimma and all affected in the bestial attack. We have since learnt that there were fatalities with others injured and maimed during the attack. “The party and indeed our security services will definitely not watch helplessly as some persons and interests attempt to turn Imo state to a killing field. “We call on the good people of Imo state to go about their legal activities without fear and resist these enemies of the state.”
