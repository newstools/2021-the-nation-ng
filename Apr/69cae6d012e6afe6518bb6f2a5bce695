Leicester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho has been nominated for the PFA Fans’ Player of the Month award in March, sponsored by Bristol Street Motors. The Leicester City striker scored seven goals in four games for the Foxes in March, while the Foxes picked up seven Premier League points from a possible nine and reached the semi-finals of the Emirates FA Cup. Following a superb strike during the 1-1 draw at Burnley, the Nigeria international added another to his tally in a 2-1 win at Brighton & Hove Albion, before netting a first Foxes hat-trick in a 5-0 success over Sheffield United at King Power Stadium. Iheanacho then made it seven goals in four games in all competitions with a brace of efforts in a 3-1 victory over Manchester United on Filbert Way, securing Leicester’s place in the semi-finals of the Emirates FA Cup for the first time since 1982.  The 24-year-old forward is nominated alongside Luke Shaw (Manchester United), Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal), Jesse Lingard (West Ham United), Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur) and Riyad Mahrez (Manchester City). Meanwhile, Wilfred Ndidi believes Iheanacho can continue to improve and put two years of criticism firmly behind him. “I am very happy for him because he’s doing wonderfully well now and everyone can see. “It’s just sad that when he needed encouragement in the past few years many were quick to write him off, but thankfully some of these people have now turned around to praise him. That’s life.”
