Osun State Government has dissociated the state from a seditious group going round public schools, disseminating secession message of the Yoruba nation to pupils. The government, through the Ministry of Education, has suspended head teachers of the three schools who allowed the seditious group into the premises to speak with the pupils. Reacting to a viral video, which showed the group talking to the pupils about the plan of the Yoruba nation to secede from Nigeria, Education Commissioner Folorunsho Bamisayemi said the Governor Adegboyega Oyetola administration was not aware and never gave consent to the body to speak with public school pupils. Bamisayemi, who stressed that the current administration frowned at any move to disunite the country, said the state had never associated with any group on what he described as a move capable of hindering the countryâ€™s unity. The Special Adviser to Governor Oyetola on Education, Mr. Jamiu Olawumi, said it was unfortunate that some unscrupulous elements were going about polluting the minds of young children because they knew that they were still naive.
