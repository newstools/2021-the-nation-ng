The football world has celebrated ex-Nigeria and Ajax star Finidi George who turns 50 on Thursday. Considered to be one of Nigeria’s greatest wingers, the legendary former footballer took to his Instagram page to celebrate life and attainment of the golden jubilee age. He posted a picture of himself with the caption: “Just to wake up and see the light today is special. Am half a century already. It’s a good day to be happy. I pray to God for another 50.” The world football governing body, FIFA, the Nigeria Football Federation, as well as Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam, have lauded the talented right-winger who has now become a coach as he hits 50. Finidi, who made his debut for Nigeria in 1991 in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Burkina Faso, providing three assists for Rashidi Yekini and scoring one in a 7–1 rout, made a name for himself at Ajax with which he won the Champion League in 1995. The NFF took to its Twitter handle to celebrate the legend. It tweeted: “50 hearty cheers to former @NGSuperEagles forward, Finidi George. Thank you George for the memories and have a good one.
