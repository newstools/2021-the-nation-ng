Kanye West and Kim Kardashian will share joint custody of their four children following their divorce. According to reports, in both of their filings, the US rapper and TV reality star agreed that their marriage should end over irreconcilable differences. They have also agreed that they do not need spousal support. West, 43, and Kardashian West, 40, are billionaires and reportedly have a prenuptial agreement that neither of them are contesting. Kardashian West filed for divorce from West on February 19, 2021, after seven years of marriage. The celebrity power couple got married in May 2014 in a lavish ceremony in Italy after two years of dating. They have four children: daughters North, 7, and Chicago, 3, and sons Saint, 5, and Psalm, who will turn 2 next month. The news of their split first broke in December, when Page Six reported the couple was “done.” The report came after what appeared to be a tumultuous year for the pair. Recall last July, in a later-deleted tweet, West said he had been considering divorcing his wife since 2018. In the same series of tweets, he referred to Kardashian West’s mother, Kris Jenner, as “Kris Jong-Un” in apparent reference to the leader of North Korea.
