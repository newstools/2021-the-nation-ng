  As part of the activities leading to the annual Best of Nollywood (BON) Awards, the First Lady of Kogi State, Rashida Yahaya Bello will join past winners to read to children on May 27. The board and organisers of BON awards announced during the week in Lokoja, Kogi state after a visit to the first lady. The organisers also noted that the book reading will be hosted at the State House in Lokoja. The children would listen to the Kogi First Lady of the state, read to them in the company of Nollywood actors that include Aishat Lawal, Ali Nuhu, Lateef Adedimeji, and Yomi Fash-Lanso. Others include Gbenga Adeyinka, Fathia Williams, Adebimpe Oyebade, Biola Adebayo, and Efe Irele. The BON book reading is an event held for children in the year’s host state for the awards.  Asides from the fact that it is the first time after the COVID-19 pandemic that BON Awards would be hosting a reading, the event, as usual, is scheduled to coincide with the 2021 Children’s Day celebration. For this year, the organisers of the leading pan-Nigerian film industry awards have revealed that the official book of the year is Chinua Achebe’s ‘The Trouble with Nigeria,’ and over 1000 children from all over Kogi State are expected at the event. The organisers of the BON awards also hinted that the event will be held on December 11 in Kogi state following Governor Yahaya Bello’s decision to accept the hosting rights on Tuesday, March 2. Speaking on the reading, BON Awards founder Seun Oloketuyi revealed that “this is an important part of the series of events that make up BON because it is for the children, and we are glad that the First Lady graciously accepted to host the reading.”
