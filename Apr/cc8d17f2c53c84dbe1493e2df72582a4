The pan Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has denied media reports that it has appointed a new secretary general. It said Basorun Seinde Arogbofa remained its secretary general until it followed its normal process of selecting its officials in line with its tradition. The Publicity Secretary of the Ondo chapter of the group, Mr. Dele Thomas, in a statement said there was no office known as General Secretary in Afenifere structure, but Secretary General. The statement said the next national caucus and general meeting that would hold in Akure would address pending issues. The statement said: “We didn’t react earlier because of our great respect for our departed colleague and National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Comrade Yinka Odumakin, who was lying at the morgue when the news broke out. “We wish to further console with the wife of the late Odumakin, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin and the family. We also commiserate with Pa Reuben Fasoranti, the leader of Afenifere and the Acting Leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, as well as other leaders and members of the Afenifere home and abroad on this irreparable loss. “Finally, we take this opportunity to congratulate the Afenifere family on the 70th anniversary of the Afenifere Ideological Group. This anniversary, which comes up on Friday and Sunday, will serve as a re-bounce of the group’s activities after the demise of its spokesman, Yinka Odumakin.”
