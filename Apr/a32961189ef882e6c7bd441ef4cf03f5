 A random act of Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, is to find time to attend weddings despite the daunting responsibilities his office holds. While it could be argued that he loves weddings or it is his own way of supporting young couples, the reason he does that is uncertain. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria recently played the role of a Chairman at the marriage of Simisola Adedunmola and Oluwashina Jacob in Ibadan, and he didnâ€™t leave without counselling the couple. He cautioned the PhD holders to know the difference between expectation and reality. He also urged them to embrace God in whatever they do. While the husband holds a PhD in Environment Science, the wife has her PHD in Pharmacy. Their beautiful wedding started with an engagement/traditional ceremony on Thursday, March 25, 2021, at the International Conference Centre. Two days later, the union was blessed at Oritamefa Baptist Church, Ibadan. For the classy reception was held at ICC, Ibadan, Sir Shina Peters was on the band stand and he did what he has been doing for years. Wife of former Oyo State Governor, Mrs. Kemi Alao-Akala; Pastor Olubi & Pastor Mrs. Sarah Johnson; Alhaji Kolajo Lawal, Yeye Bose Adedibu, Senator Gbenga & Mrs Sade Ashafa, Chief Bayo & Mrs Adewusi; Senator Teslim Folarin and Chief Adebayo Adelabu attended the event.
