The Federal Government has expressed worries that expatriates are taking over jobs in the country. According to the government, the development is responsible for the soaring number of unemployed youths. The latest Nigeria Bureau of Statistics’ (NBS) report showed that 33 per cent of the country’s population is unemployed. Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, while declaring open a stakeholders’ meeting on expatriate quota administration in Abuja on Wednesday, said uncontrolled activities of foreigners were starving Nigerian youths of employment opportunities. Aregbesola lamented that the horrible stories of insecurity in the media was a cause for concern to all patriotic Nigerians.
