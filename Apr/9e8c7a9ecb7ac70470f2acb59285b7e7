The church should proffer solutions to social problems as a critical stakeholder, a leader of the Men League of the Christ Church, Dr Nelson Uwaga, has said. He believes the church occupies an important role in the society and should provide an independent and influential voice. According to him, it is for this reason that the Men League of the Christ Church initiated a social movement named “the Forum” with the mandate to address critical national issues. He said the maiden summit of “the Forum” will hold in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, on June 12, with the theme: “What Nigerians want.” It will feature discourses by experts on church and politics, beyond oil and gas, security, food security, how to harness the Southsouth economic potential, among others. Uwaga told reporters that the platform’s objective is to serve as a moral compass by raising awareness on sensitive and topical issues of national development. Vice President of the Men’s League, Sotonye Etom, a lawyer, added that the Forum’s goal is also to contribute to the society’s transformation. Governors, religious leaders and other top government functionaries are expected at the event.
