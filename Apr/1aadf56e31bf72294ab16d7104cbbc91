The Nation reports since the demise of the Itsekiri monarch, the government has maintained a deafening silence on the crisis that engulfed the kingdom. President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the new Olu-designate despite the controversies surrounding his emergence. Delta Information Commissioner, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, said the government was not aware of Ikenwoli’s passage and selection of a successor. Anaigwu also said he was not aware of the controversies in Itsekiriland over the passage of the royal father. He said: “Each community in Delta State has laid down rules/tradition and ruling houses; so Itsekiri will not be different. “The Delta State Government has not been informed that the Olu of Warri has passed away. For us, we are not aware that Olu of Warri has died. “To us, there’s no controversy because we were not informed. The issue of the Olu of Warri is the same thing to all the communities. “When a king dies, the community will write to the government, which will do all that is necessary for the purpose of smooth transition. “It is not entirely the issue of once the father dies, the son takes over.”
