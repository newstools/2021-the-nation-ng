Seventeen famous Northern groups, including the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) have lamented the region is worse off under President Muhammadu Buhari. This was one of the major outcomes after a two-day Northern People’s Summit in Kaduna. The groups, in a communiqué read by Professor Doknan Sheni, said: “The North invites the attention of President Muhammadu Buhari, Northern Governors and legislators to the fact that under their watch the North has sunk lower in all indices of human existence.” They lamented the region has been overtaken by insurgents, bandits and poor governance, urging political actors to change the narratives. The group added: “Delegates at the summit commit to continuously engage in searching for solutions, as well as raising their voices against poor governance, corruption and absence of commitment to deal with insecurity, poverty and hopelessness among Northerners.” While asking the government to show effective presence in all ungoverned spaces in the North, they said: “The North resolves that there should be government-backed negotiations and dialogue with the bandits, Boko Haram and affected communities for effective peace in the North.”
