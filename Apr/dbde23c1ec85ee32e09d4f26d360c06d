The Forum of State Chairmen of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to conduct Congresses and convene the National Convention within the time frame given it by the National Executive Committee (NEC) last December. The forum also appealed for extension of the membership registration and revalidation exercise, which ended officially on March 31, 2021 nationwide. Addressing newsmen after the forum’s meeting, which lasted for almost two hours in Abuja, the chairman and Borno Caretaker Committee chairman, Hon. Ali Buka Dalori, said: “We urgently call for: (a) the immediate conduct of Congresses and convening of the National Convention; and (b) to allow for completion of all other tasks assigned to CECPC (by NEC) within the time frame.”
