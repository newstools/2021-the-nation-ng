The Chairman, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Buba Marwa, has said that the current push to conduct a drug test on politicians, workers and students, is to enable the organization to provide urgent help to those who need treatment and rehabilitation, in addition to serving as deterrence. Marwa spoke during the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  with a firm, Primly Services Limited (PSL) for the supply of free drug test kits to NDLEA in Abuja, on Thursday. Explaining the rationale behind the push for a drug test, he said: “Practically, all Nigerians should be subjected to drug test: politicians, students, workers and all. “We have set the ball rolling at the agency because charity begins at home. This will enable us to know those afflicted, who need treatment and rehabilitation. “Equally, it will deter drug abuse because if you know that the result of a drug test will hamper your progression in school, political career or at work, it will deter you. “In the same vein, we do expect parents to make sure their children don’t get married to addicts by insisting on a drug test before marriage.” He was delighted that the MoU was finally signed almost three years after the Federal Government had approved the deal. Marwa said PSL has provided high-quality test kits at no cost to the NDLEA, adding that the company will recover its cost during testing. Speaking earlier, the Managing Director of PSL, Vincent Udenze, said, apart from the test kits, the company would ” ensure that the kits are one of the best in the country, and we will not fail in our duty in this regard.”
