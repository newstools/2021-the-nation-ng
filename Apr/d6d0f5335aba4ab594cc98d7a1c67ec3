Teachers in Lagos have been trained on the prevention of substance abuse in school. The training is facilitated by the Global Initiative on Substance Abuse (GISA). Director and Head Child Guidance, School Counselling and Special Education, Mrs Olusola Somoye, who represented the Lagos Commissioner for Education, praised the group for its efforts towards ending drug abuse in school. She spoke at the opening of the second batch of a six-day training of secondary school teachers on evidence-based substance use prevention. Somoye said: “We are excited that beyond the training of teachers on substance use prevention, mechanisms have been put in place to monitor the application of knowledge and skills in the respective schools. This is highly commendable and worthy of emulation.” Somoye said the problem of substance abuse concerns everyone and advised participants to be committed to this course for a better society. GISA Founder/Executive Director, Dr Martin Agwogie, said the training was to equip the school functionaries with the required tools for substance use prevention interventions in the school setting. Agwogie noted that the training was one of the first and most comprehensive evidence-based substances use prevention training ever organised for secondary school personnel in Nigeria.
