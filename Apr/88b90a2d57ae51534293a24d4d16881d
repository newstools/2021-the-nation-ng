Real Madrid have had more than their fair share of injuries of late, but there was positive news for Los Blancos on Friday as Eden Hazard trained with the rest of his teammates a day before the LaLiga Santander clash with Real Betis, and Zinedine Zidane has confirmed he will be in the squad. The Belgian has not played since March 13 against Elche, in which the winger was returning from a muscle injury that kept him out for just over a month.  Hazard fell suffered another injury in that game and his return, as a result, has been carefully managed so as to prevent the same from happening. The former Chelsea man has been training with the team for three weeks now, but Zinedine Zidane did not even call him up for either the Liverpool second leg or El Clasico, nor league games with Getafe and Cadiz. “Eden is going to be with us [against Betis], he is going to be on the list,” Zidane confirmed in Friday’s press conference.
