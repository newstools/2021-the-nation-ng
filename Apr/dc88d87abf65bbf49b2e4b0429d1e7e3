  The Lagos State Citizens Mediation Centre (CMC), Ojokoro-Ijaiye,  has successfully  returned the family of one Olalekan Balogun to their apartment after being locked out by his aggrieved landlord for 18 days. The family was denied access to their apartment and rendered homeless after the landlord allegedly seized their belongings and sent them packing over their inability to meet up with the rent payment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which adversely affected the family business. A statement issued yesterday by the CMC Public Affairs Officer,  Popoola Olaide said the victim had reported the matter to the police at Meiran. He said the Landlord, Edwin Odigie, failed to honour police invitations. Balogun said, “All I had for many days was the cloth on my body because my landlord denied us access into our apartment  because I could not meet up with payment of rent due to the Covid-19 pandemic which adversely affected my small-scale business”. The quick intervention of Lagos State Citizens’ Mediation Centre (CMC) finally brought succour to the homeless family as the Centre invited the parties to mediation sessions. The CMC resolved the misunderstanding between them and the family was granted full access to their apartment  and belongings.
