Fidelity Bank Plc has recorded a strong financial performance in the first quarter of the year. It posted an appreciable growth in profits for the period ended 31 March 31. The details of the unaudited results released on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) show that Profit Before Tax (PBT) grew by 53.9 per cent from N6.6 billion in 2020 to N10.1 billion for the corresponding period on March 31. The net revenue in the period also increased by 13.4 per cent from N30.3 billion in first quarter of 2020 to N34.4 billion this year, just as the bank recorded growth in other performance indices. Commenting on the results, the banks Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, said: “We commenced the year showing impressive double-digit growth in profitability and improved performance across key efficiency indices whilst ensuring our business model continued to deliver strong positive results in line with our guidance for the 2021 financial year. “Gross earnings increased by 7.7% YoY to N55.1bn on account of 66.7% growth in non-interest revenue to N12.1 billion from N7.2 billion in Q1 2020. “In absolute terms, the increase in NIR came from FX related income, digital banking income and account maintenance charge etc. as total customers’ induced transactions across all our service channels increased by 30.4% YoY and 17.1% QoQ. “The net interest Margin remained unchanged at 6.3% compared to 2020FY as the drop in average funding cost offset the decline in average yields on earning assets. Average funding cost dropped to 2.5% from 3.6% in 2020FY due to a combination of improved deposit mix and a slight moderation in average borrowing cost. “This led to 26.2% decline in total interest expenses, which translated to 17.1% increase in net interest income to N28.8bn despite a 4.3% increase in interest bearing liabilities. We refinanced our seven yaer N30.0 billion Tier II Bonds issued in 2015 at 16.48% p.a.  with cheaper 10-Yr N41.2bn Tier II Bonds priced at 8.5% p.a., which led to a 61bpts drop in average borrowing cost to 4.5%.”
