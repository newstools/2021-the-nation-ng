The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on Monday lamented that chasing substandard products all over the country other than ports and border stations has been a herculean task to the regulators. It, therefore, urged the Federal Government to introduce SON in the nation’s ports to effectively check influx of substandard products. Its Director-General, Farooq Salim, told reporters in Ilorin when he led a team on an inspection of a steel manufacturing company, KAM Holdings, in the state capital. The SON chief said: “It is important to note that non-involvement of SON at some ports in the country’s operations has continued to pose challenges, particularly to the agency’s compliance and monitoring units.” Salim said it is only in Nigeria that the standard organisation’s directorate is not at the ports to authenticate imported goods brought. “This is counter-productive to the economy of the nation.It is easier to fight the influx of substandard products at the points of entry than chasing them around all over the country in markets and warehouses, among others.” He also said that over 85 per cent of the products imported into the country daily, monthly or yearly come through the seaports and waterways, saying it would, therefore, be difficult to ignore the maritime sector operators in the quest for zero imports of substandard and unwholesome products, as well as the federal government’s ease of doing business policy. In a remark, KAM Holdings Chairman Alhaji Kamoru Yusuf made a case for the reintroduction of pre-shipment for the inspection of goods at the nation’s ports to ceckmate proliferation of arms, substandard products and loss of revenue in the country. Alhaji Yusuf asked SON to invest more on technologies that will help rid the country of substandard steel products. He declared the preparedness of KAM Holdings to work with the SON in ensuring that standards are upheld in the iron and steel sector of the country.
