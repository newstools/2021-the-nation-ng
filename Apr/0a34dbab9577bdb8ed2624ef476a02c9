Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde has commended the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Working Committee (NWC) for deciding to go ahead with the Southwest Zonal Congress. The congress has been scheduled for Saturday, April 10, 2021. Makinde praised the NWC for the decision, stating that he was glad the organ “bowed to superior reasoning regarding the congress.” He however warned the NWC against allowing divisive elements within the party to “unduly influence party decisions on the national level.” He added: “Any attempt to shift the date of the PDP National Congress from April 10 is a signal to party loyalists that the hierarchy has been compromised,” an action which he said would lead to “dire consequences.” Makinde added” “As the only serving PDP governor in the Southwest and an invested party in the PDP’s growth and development, I commend the National Working Committee (NWC) for the decision to go ahead with the Southwest Congress. “The NWC should rise to its responsibilities and prevail on the person or persons acting as clogs in the wheel of the party’s progress. Remember, the PDP is greater than any individual.”
