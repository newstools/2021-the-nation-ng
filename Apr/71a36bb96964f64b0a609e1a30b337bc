The Mushroom Growers Association and Marketers of Nigeria said at the weekend that mushroom has the potential to change the unemployment situation in the country and if properly developed along value chain, can provide 10 million skilled, semi-1skilled and unskilled jobs. The President of the group, Chief Michael Awunor, said mushroom can increase the country’s non-oil earnings. He added that the production of mushroom has continued to increase significantly. Awunor spoke at a briefing on the first National Mushroom Summit/ Exhibition with the theme, ‘Harnessing the nation non-oil commodities through the development of mushroom value chain’ scheduled for Abuja. He said the world production for mushroom in 2018 was 8.99million tons with China producing 46 per cent of global output. Africa production stands at 29.77,000 tons contributed mainly by South Africa, Madagascar, Morocco, Algeria, Zimbabwe and Tunisia. Nigeria’s yearly production in 2019 was 1.5tons, which is 1,495kg. The global market for mushroom is quite huge and growing exponentially. The market is estimated at $45.3billion in 2020 and projected to reach $72.5billion by 2027. He also said the growing market for mushroom is due to the rising awareness for healthy foods which made mushroom highly preferred substitute for meat in protein, vitamin and minerals.
