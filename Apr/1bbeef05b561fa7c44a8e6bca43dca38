In a bid to tackle sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and to encourage its reporting in Alimosho Local Government Area (LGA), the Women’s Right and Health Project has held town hall meetings across the six local council development areas in the LGA. An official of WRAHP, Ibukun Olapeju, said the abuse of women and children were becoming a big problem that required urgent action and government intervention. “The alarming rate of SGBV especially on women and children shows that there is a need for education and protection of individuals against child abuse, sexual abuse, harassment, forced labour, domestic violence, rape, etc. “There has been a lot of cases recently, which triggered this programme and we are happy that we have the support of the EU-funded Rule of Law and Anti-corruption (RoLAC) programme managed by the British Council in Nigeria,” she said. She noted that WRAHP will continue to organise different programmes focusing on SGBV to sensitise and educate the community.
