Lagos Governor Bababjide Sanwo-Olu has celebrated Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Sunday Erhabor for displaying professionalism, composure and self-restraint in the face of provocation. Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu presented Erhabor to the Governor on Monday at the State House in Ikeja. Erhabor is attached to the Rapid Response Squad (RRS). In a video that went viral at the weekend, Erhabor was being assaulted by a motorist, Victor Ebhomenyen (33), who contravened traffic laws by driving against traffic. Erhabor was however calm and composed and exercised self-restraint despite holding a AK-47 rifle. The incident happened at Four Point Hotel, Oniru, Victoria Island. A statement by the police spokesperson, Muyiwa Adejobi, said Ebhomenyen drove against vehicular traffic, assaulting and causing bodily injuries to a police officer attached to the RRS. Sanwo-Olu praised Erhabor for displaying utmost professionalism in the face of outright provocation, and urged other officers to emulate him. He said: “We are quick to condemn policemen, especially when they are found wanting; we are very quick to admonish them as well, but officer Erhabor’s demeanor shows there are still commendable police officers. “In the real heat of provocation ASP Sunday Erhabor displayed restraint and calmness. He restrained himself from taking law into his own hands. I think the gesture is enough to bring him out so he can be used as a testimonial and encouragement for others that they can be civil and law abiding as exemplified by ASP Erhabor. “We thank him for showing patience and decorum, and others should emulate him.” Ebhomenyen’s vehicle has since been impounded and taken to the Lagos State Taskforce Office in Oshodi for appropriate penalty in tandem with provisions of the Lagos State Transport Sector Reform Law (2018).
