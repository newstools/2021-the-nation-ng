A man has been found dead on the road in Ibarapa North council area of Oyo State. Babarinde Mufutau, 56, a farmer, had deep machete cuts to the back, arms and leg, and bled to death, Secretary of Farmers (Akowe Agbe), Ibarapa North, Taiwo Adeagbo said. Adeagbo said Mufutau was attacked about 7pm on Wednesday by suspected herders at Orita Meta village on his way home from his farm. He said the victim bled to death as a result of the deep injuries on him and due to the unavailability of anyone to rescue him after the attack. He said the killers were at large, adding that investigation was ongoing. Efforts to confirm the story from the Oyo State Police Command proved abortive as spokesman Adewale Osifesoâ€™s telephones switched off.
