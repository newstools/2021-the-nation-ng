The people of Nkari in Ini Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State on Wednesday said an incessant boundary crisis led them to bear arms to farms. The community has been engaged in a long-drawn communal war with Usaka Ukwu in Ikwuano Local Government Area of Abia State. Chairman of Ini LGA, Mr Israel Idaisin, said his people have resorted to defending themselves. He urged Federal Government to intervene in the protracted Nkari boundary crisis to prevent further bloodshed. He lamented that even women and children from Nkari community now go to farms with riffles. Idaisin said: “Everyone is either with a long or short riffle to protect themselves from possible attacks. “We are appealing to the Federal Government to take over the disputed land or do proper demarcation to forestall further loss of lives.  Thousands of people have over the years lost their lives to this same crisis.”
