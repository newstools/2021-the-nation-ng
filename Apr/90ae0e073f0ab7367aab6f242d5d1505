The Lagos State Water Regulatory Commission (LASWARCO) in conjunction with the Association of Table Water Producers of Nigeria (ATWAP) have set machinery in motion to rid the state of illegal table water producers. Speaking at a public forum recently, while giving his keynote address, ATWAP Lagos State Chairman,  Alhaji Yisau Adeoye, urged members to work together to phase out quacks that have infiltrated the table water business. Also speaking on the occasion, the Executive Secretary of the LASWARCO, Mrs Funke Femi Adepoju, said the law empowers the LASWARCO to provide good clean and affordable water for consumption. She also enjoined the association to work in accordance with the regulatory framework to deliver quality assurance in their production of water. Adepoju further disclosed that the state government has since approved a mobile laboratory for the Commission to aid the testing of water regularly just as she stressed the need for the training of personnel involved with production and quality assurance. She, however, noted that the monitoring and compliance unit of the Commission will ensure that people’s lives are not endangered in any way by preventing the production and consumption of polluted products by unscrupulous businessmen. Speaking earlier, in her goodwill message, the President of ATWAP Mrs. Clementina Ativie lauded the founding members of the association for their support just as she impressed on members the need to adhere to strictest safety standards which guarantees quality at all times. ATWAP, she stressed, has been in existence since the last 22 years, as such she urged members to do everything humanly possible to sustain the legacies of the founders. She further reiterated the need for the government to liaise with ATWAP for better performance just as she noted that it was utmost importance that members continue to adhere to the guidelines of the Commission to ensure expect quality assurance as far as table water production is concerned
