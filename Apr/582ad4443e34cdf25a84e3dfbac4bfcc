Manchester City took another significant step towards the Premier League title with a 2-0 victory at Leicester City.
The visitors dominated from the off and thought they were ahead on five minutes. Fernandinho rifled a 35-yard strike into the bottom corner but Sergio Aguero – who was appearing for the first time since his impending summer departure from City was announced – was deemed to be offside. Kevin de Bruyne then hit the crossbar with a stunning free kick before Leicester’s best moment saw Jamie Vardy’s strike ruled out for offside on the stroke of half time. The pattern of Man City dominance continued after the break and they deservedly took the lead on 58 minutes when Benjamin Mendy showed great composure to cut inside and place a low shot into the far corner. Gabriel Jesus made sure of the points when he slid home the second after superb build up from Raheem Sterling and de Bruyne. The result sees the Citizens move 17 points clear at the top of the table, although second-placed Manchester United have two games in hand. Leicester remain a point behind the Red Devils in third spot. City now switch their attention to Tuesday’s Champions League quarter final first leg against Borussia Dortmund. Leicester visit West Ham in the league next Sunday.
