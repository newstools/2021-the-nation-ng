Manchester City Kevin De Bruyne admitted his side should have scored more after securing a narrow 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday. De Bruyne opened the scoring in the first half before Marco Reus grabbed a vital away goal for Dortmund with his 84th-minute strike. Phil Foden bagged a crucial late winner in the 90th minute, but City still have plenty of work to do in the quarter-final second leg next week. “We saw the way they played,” De Bruyne told BT Sport. “They played really well with the ball. It causes some problems sometimes. I think in the first half we had a little bit of difficulty finding the chances but in the second half we created a few. “We probably should have scored a little bit more but obviously when they came back to 1-1, that was a little shame but it happens. I think the reaction was really good so to get the win is good. We know 2-1 is a tricky score but at least we are ahead for the second leg.” City head coach Pep Guardiola added: “Dortmund are strong, a good quality with the players they have and the quality it is difficult to do what we want to do, but 2-1 and we have a good chance next week. “We are going to watch the game. We will adjust a few things to go there and try to win the game. Next is Leeds and then we go to Germany to try and win the game. “Borussia Dortmund is a typical club from the Champions League. We have one more game there and with the result 2-1 we will try to score the goals there to win.” Goal
