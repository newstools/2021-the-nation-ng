Osun has suspended three principals for allowing a group of secessionists preach to their students. The group was seen in a viral video indoctrinating the students on secession and Yoruba nationhood. A statement by Commissioner for Education, Folorunsho Bamisayemi, distanced the state from the secession plan by the group going around Osun schools to preach the secession message of the Yoruba nation to students. He noted the three principals were suspended for allowing the seditious group into their school premises to speak with the students. According to him: ” A viral video showed the group talking to the students about the plan of the Yoruba nation to secede from Nigeria. “The administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola was not aware and never gave consent to the group to speak with public school students in the State. “The administration of Governor Oyetola frowns at any move to disunite the country, the State had never at any point in time associated with any group on what he described as a move that is capable of hindering the unity of the country. “Nigeria is one entity and will continue to remain so. The State Government of Osun never gave consent to any group to speak with students of public schools on a matter we know can cause disunity and chaos in the country. “As a Nigerian state, we believe in the Nigerian dream. We urge every Nigerian to pray and work for Nigeria not to break up. As for those principals that allowed such a group into the premises of our schools, they will face the consequences of their actions. Special Adviser to Governor Oyetola on Education, Hon. Jamiu Olawumi,  said it was unfortunate some unscrupulous elements were going about polluting the minds of young children because they knew they are still naive. While warning such seditious groups to stay away from  Osun, the Special Adviser said students in the state will continue to be symbols of unity at all times.
