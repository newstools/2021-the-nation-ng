 The African Action Congress (AAC) has revalidated the position of Omoyele Sowore, the convener of #RevolutionNow, as its national chairman. The party at its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Abuja insisted at no point did it suspend or expel its national chair. A faction of the AAC led by Dr Leonard Nzenwa expelled Sowore from the party for using it as a platform to mobilise for his revolution against the Federal Government and other anti- party activities. But the party said the continuous recognition and dealings with party usurpers in contravention to the constitution of the AAC by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is a departure from the Electoral Act. The party, in a communiqué, demanded the “recognition of Omoyele Sowore as the National Chairman of the African Action Congress and other National Officers who were elected along with Sowore at the Lagos Convention by INEC. “Stoppage of efforts to remove State Chairmen of the AAC across the country and a clear memo to this effect should be sent to all Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECS). INEC must stop Its unprincipled and unnecessary meddlesomeness in the party”. The party also chided the Federal Government for shielding the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, despite his alleged past ties to terrorist organisations.
