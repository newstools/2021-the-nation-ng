The National Engineering and Technical Company (NETCO), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), is set to extend its operations to Equatorial Guinea. It is exploring business opportunities to boost its revenue generation capacity in line with the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari’s vision to make NETCO the hub of engineering, procurement and construction in the West African sub-region and a major revenue earner. NETCO Managing Director, Mr Usman Baba, stated this during an oversight visit of the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream) to the company yesterday in Lagos. Usman said  NETCO was established in December 1988 to provide an efficient and reliable engineering base for the NNPC Group and the Nigerian oil and gas industry.
