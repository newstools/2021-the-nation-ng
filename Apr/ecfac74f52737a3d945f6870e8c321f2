Seventeen famous Northern groups, including the Northern Elders Forum (NEF); Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) have rejected zoning of the presidency. They however supported restructuring of the polity to save the nation from socio-economic degradation. The groups, in a communiqué at the end of the two-day summit, reiterated restructuring is a vital necessity for survival of the nation as one united entity. Chairman Communiqué Drafting Committee, Professor Doknan Sheni, said: “The North believes that restructuring the country is now a vital necessity for survival as one united entity. The North will not be stampeded or blackmailed into taking major decision around rotating the Presidency. “The North draws attention of the country to the inherent fragility of Nigerian State. For Nigeria to survive, all parts of the country must equally commit to supporting its continuation as one entity, without equivocation or subterfuge. “The North extends an invitation to groups that are genuinely interested in discussing the future of the country. “The North believes that every interest can be accommodated in one united, just and equitable nation but the North cannot be the sole custodian of this endeavour. “The North warns against the continuation of demonisation, attacks and killings of Northerners in the Southern parts of the country. “It demands that federal and state governments must take firmer steps to protect members of Northern communities who live in the South. “This includes the arrest and prosecution of persons who are involved in these dangerous activities. The North urges Northern communities to continue to exercise restraint and be good hosts.”
