 Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter says he will not appeal against the ban imposed on him last month, claiming the members of the world governing body’s ethics committee are “biased”. The 85-year-old was issued with a suspension of six years and eight months on March 24, which will begin when an existing ban expires in October. FIFA’s ethics committee found Blatter was part of a “vicious circle” of officials who sought to award themselves over £50m in undeclared payments. He was given 21 days from notification of the sanction to send a statement of appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) if he wished to challenge the ruling, but has opted not to do so. Blatter told the PA news agency via a spokesman: “I do not consider the FIFA ethics committee to have jurisdiction in this matter. “Further, the committee members are biased. So it doesn’t make sense to appeal.” The decision not to appeal means Blatter will be banned from football until June 2028, when he will be 92. He was found to have accepted undue economic benefits totalling 23 million Swiss francs (just under £18m) and approved payments or bonuses of a further 46m Swiss francs (just under £36m) to other officials. In addition to the ban, he was fined one million Swiss francs (just under £780,000).
