  Gun-wielding cultists have invaded the Kabangha community in Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State. They shot two persons dead. It was gathered that the incident happened on Sunday night. A source said one of the victims identified as Nwinee was shot in his bed and he died on the spot while the other person, an elderly man, Basi Duuduu, was rushed to hospital. A source said the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) visited the area at night and took the injured victim to the hospital. He said: “We received information this morning that some cult boys invaded Kabangha Community in Khana LGA and shot two persons last night.  “One of those shot called Nwinee died on the spot as he was shot on the neck in his bed while the other one was evacuated to a hospital in Bori by the Active DPO in Bori who responded immediately and came to Kabangha last night”. He recalled that on March 28, some cult boys also invaded the community and killed one Emeka Erasmus, whose hands were cut off before he was shot in the eyes. A brother to the deceased, Kingston Nwinee, said cultists had been after his brother since last year, saying he reported their activities to the police. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni could not be reached for comments.
