Member of the House of Representatives representing Ikeja Federal Constituency, James Abiodun Faleke, has called on wealthy individuals and corporate organisations not to relent in assisting government at all levels to improve education in the country. Faleke, the Chairman of the House Committee on Finance, spoke last Wednesday and Thursday when he donated exercise books, textbooks to primary schools in his constituency and inaugurated a block of six classrooms at the State Primary School, Onilekere, Ikeja. Faleke’s view was presented by All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairmanship aspirant for Ojodu Local Council Development Area, Alhaja Kafayat Funmilayo Layeni (KFL); Chairman of Onigbongbo Local Council Development Area, Dotun Olakanle; and his counterpart in Ikeja Local Government, Mojeed Balogun. Faleke said education expenditure continues to increase making it difficult for government alone to shoulder the responsibility. “We all have to play our part and contribute our quota to the development of the education sector in the country,” he said. A block of six classrooms was inaugurated at Estate Primary School, Onilekere while 12,474 exercise books, 15,756 textbooks, 510 The Phonics textbooks, 510 The Spelling Champion and 510 The Heritage textbooks were distributed among pupils of Estate Primary, Ogba; Olusosun Primary School, Olusosun; Ojodu Primary School, Ojodu; Army Children School, Maryland; and Ikeja Primary, GRA, Ikeja.
