 South-African-based Nigerian singer, songwriter, and sound engineer Aderemi ‘Remmy XO’ Adeyemo has opened up about his journey into music and plans for 2021. The music act revealed that he began his journey into music just after completing high school. He said he began playing musical instruments, till he left for South Africa to study sound engineering and also perfect his craft. During his early days in Nelson Mandela’s country, Remmy XO released his first song entitled ‘Controlla’ in 2017. In 2019, he dropped an infectious afro-pop single titled ‘sweet love’ which was produced by his 95ISSUE label mate, ‘OBT’. He said, “the music journey has been amazing and very challenging also, so many sleepless nights to put in more work for the craft and I have also been inspired by my environment and the music itself.”  Speaking about his plans for 2021, Remmy XO revealed that he will be releasing a couple of singles with amazing visuals and a body of work before the fourth quarter. Remmy XO has since released three more singles, ’Call Me’ featuring OBT, ‘Popo’ and ‘Money’ which features Dreamboi. In 2020, the singer released his fourth single, ‘Popo,’ to support and lend his voice to the distress call against police brutality.
