Idris Okuneye, aka Bobrisky, has blocked his one-time ‘best friends forever’, actress, Tonto Dikeh, on Instagram after Tonto unfollowed him. The duo, which stopped hanging out and making comments on social media pages, has not been on talking terms. Recall they usually flaunted their love for each other and were always seen together at social events. At some points, Bobrisky vowed never to leave his best friend, until death did them part. In October 2019, Tonto had first threatened to block Bobrisky on Instagram, if he pleads on behalf of users who claim to be operating celebrities’ fan pages. According to Dikeh, some users open fan pages and allegedly sell them out, after they must have gathered enough followers.
