The leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has taken Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde and ex-Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose to the Bukola Saraki-led Reconciliation and Strategic Committee. The move followed festering disagreement between the governor and the former governor over the control of the PDP in the Southwest. The disagreement has caused hiccup in the planned congress in the Southwest, forcing the PDP leadership to put the exercise on hold.A statement yesterday by the PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the legal tussle by the two camps loyal to Makinde and Fayose had stalled the exercise. ”Consequently, the National Working Committee (NWC) resolved that a meeting comprising the national chairman, deputy national chairman, national secretary, the Senator Saraki-led Reconciliation and Strategic Committee, Governor Makinde and former Governor Fayose, be held for resolution of issues concerning the Southwest PDP. ”The NWC will meet on the outcome of this reconciliation meeting within the next 24 hours,” the statement said.
