 The lawmaker representing Oshodi/Isolo Constituency II in the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr. Jude Idimogu, has said the Southeast is not ready to produce the next president because it is divided politically. He urged the zone to align with the centre before it can stand a chance to vie for the president. The lawmaker spoke yesterday at a rally organised by his group, the Abundance United Movement (AUM), to endorse the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for the President and Speaker of the House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, for the Senate. He said: “I am Igbo, but from what I have seen, the Southeast is not ready for the president. Right now, APC is at the national level, but how many APC states are there in the Southeast? Power is not given a la carte, you must work to get it. “Things will only work for the Southeast if the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) can take power there because the zone has been loyal to the party. But now the zone is not ready.”  Idimogu, who hails from Imo State, described Tinubu as the best to rule Nigeria from 2023. He said the APC national leader is a great achiever following his good record as the Lagos State governor. According to him, Asiwaju Tinubu is the most qualified person for the president in 2023. He said: “Tinubu has shown me great love,  especially when you consider my history of moving from the PDP to the APC. He has been committed to my political ambition. So, I feel the best thing is to say thank you by encouraging my people and supporters to pray for him to become president in 2023. “We are also doing this on behalf of my great Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, who is aspiring to become the senator representing Lagos West in 2023. He has a lot of achievements and he is one of the best 10 lawmakers in the country today.”
