E-Tranzact International Plc achieved a little above half of its target under its recent capital raising. Regulatory report yesterday indicated that the N7.05 billion rights issue recorded subscription level of 52.2 per cent, about N3.65 billion out of the initial target of N7.05 billion. A total of 2.435 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each that were subscribed for were listed yesterday at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) at N1.50 per share. E-Tranzact International  had launched a N7 billion rights issue in 2020 to raise equity funds from existing shareholders. E-Tranzact offered 4.67 billion ordinary shares of 50 Kobo each at N1.50 per share. The rights were pre-allotted on the basis of 10 new ordinary shares for every nine ordinary shares held as at March 25, 2020. Shareholders of E-Tranzact had in December 2018 authorised the board of the company to raise additional capital of up to N7 billion through the issuance of any form of equity instruments, whether by way of public offering, private placement, rights issue, offer for subscription or other methods they deem fit, with or without preferential allotments, either locally or internationally, at such dates and on such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the directors. Shareholders also empowered the directors to consider as an alternative or addition issuance of convertible or non-convertible loans while allowing the company to issue undersubscribed shares to interested investors as well as absorb excess subscriptions. Shareholders had also increased the company’s authorised share capital from N2.1 billion or 4.2 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to N9.1 billion or 18.2 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each.
