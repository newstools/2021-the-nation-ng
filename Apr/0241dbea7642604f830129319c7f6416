The Senator representing Cross River North, Dr. Stephen Odey, has said Senate President Ahmad Lawan cannot be pressured to swear-in Hon. Jarigbe Agom or anyone else into the Senate to take over his seat. According to Odey, Jarigbe, House of Representatives member representing Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency, had contested the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primaries for the Cross River North senatorial seat with him following the demise of Senator Rose Oko, from which he (Odey) emerged victorious. Odey said he scored 450 votes to defeat Jarigbe who scored 90 votes at the PDP primaries. He made assertions when prominent members of his constituency visited him to show their solidarity on Wednesday in Abuja, according to a statement by one of his media aide, Isuma Isuma. Led by Hon. David Okache and Chief Dennis Oko, the group said their visit became necessary to assure the Senator people in Cross River North Senatorial District were not only solidly behind him but would ensure they do all they can to protect the overwhelming electoral mandate he got from the people. Odey said: “This is a no-issue. All the issues have been resolved. it’s a no-contest. Jarigbe is playing to the gallery. “The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan is an Honourable man, he won’t be coerced or pressured into embarking on illegality just because somebody somewhere wants his greed to be obeyed.” He tendered the result sheet endorsed by the candidates and their respective agents as well as the official letter written and signed by his party’s National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), informing the latter he was their candidate based on the ratification of the primary election results by the party’s National Working Committee (NWC). According to him, the issue PDP’s authentic candidate and winner of the election has been determined by relevant courts and institutions and the party which conducted the primaries.
