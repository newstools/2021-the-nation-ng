Sergio Aguero is determined to continue his career in the Premier League and Chelsea are in prime position to land this summer’s hottest free transfer. The greatest goalscorer in Manchester City’s history will leave the Etihad Stadium at the end of the season, bringing an end to a decade of outstanding service. But leaving City does not necessarily mean he is leaving the English game. Aguero will have offers from all around the world, including Barcelona, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, but his preference would be to remain in the Premier League as the 32-year-old believes he still has much to give in this country.  Chelsea wanted to sign Aguero in 2011 when he played for Atletico Madrid and they are one of only a handful of clubs who could pay the salary of more than £13million he has commanded at City but others who have the financial resources — Manchester United and Liverpool — are not at the table. Aguero would never ruin the relationship he has with City fans by moving across town, and Liverpool’s main aim is to sign a new central defender this summer with RB Leipzig’s Ibrahima Konate and Ben White of Brighton being considered. The idea of Aguero still playing in the Premier League, however, is intriguing and Chelsea are determined to bring in more firepower with Timo Werner, last summer’s big signing, still struggling to adapt to the division’s demands.
