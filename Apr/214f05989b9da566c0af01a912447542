The governor said: “I like this adoption initiative, as you were speaking, I was already putting down names  of who I am going to tell my sports team to go and speak with alongside some of our business people because this is a business state. “I am very proud to hear that one of our daughters is doing well and doing us proud, each and every time that we find any indigene of Ogun state doing well, we support them, we throw out weight behind them.

We will like to collaborate with you, the joy will be ours in Ogun state, but the glory is to the entire country,” he submitted.
