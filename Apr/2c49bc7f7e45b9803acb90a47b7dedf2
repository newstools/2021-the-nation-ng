A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Prince Tonye Princewill has lambasted governors in the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) following their recent comments on the state of the nation. Princewill, a former governorship candidate, said no group had fanned the flames of division more than PDP governors. He said the PDP governors were only deploying their old tricks to return to power in 2023 saying only the gullible would think that their comments were borne out of patriotism. He said the governors were planning to present a northern Presidential candidate from among themselves while trying to capitalise on a divided country to win the 2023 election. Princewill said: “Reacting to the latest outburst from the PDP governors is a distraction, but there are some who may not be wise to their intentions, so let me do them a favour and bring them some light. “In 2023, they will present us with a President from amongst themselves from the North and use a divided country to try to wangle their way into the villa. Simple. I’d rather we concentrate on a party that is still evolving.”
