Tottenham Hotspur have sensationally sacked manager Jose Mourinho. The announcement comes after Tottenham Hotspur drew 2-2 with Everton on Friday evening, leaving them down in seventh place in the table. Mourinho was appointed as Tottenham manager in November 2019, a day after the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino. He guided them to sixth place in the table by the end of the campaign, but his style of football often didnâ€™t win him much acclaim from fans.
