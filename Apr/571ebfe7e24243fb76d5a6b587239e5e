No fewer than three persons were alleged to have been killed over a clash between two communities of Ekiugbo and Otor-vwreko of Ughelli North local government area of Delta state following the alleged imposition of N5, 000 fees on traders. A source, who pleaded anonymity, named the deceased as John Mark, Odibo and a yet-to-be identified person. The source said the incident occurred on Thursday afternoon when youths from the Otor-vwreko informed they will henceforth collect fee of N5, 000 from those trading along the walkway. The source said the neighbouring Ekiugbo community challenged the announcement, leading to a free-for-all. The source said: “While the argument between the two communities heightened, from nowhere, we started hearing gunshots ranging in the air and the whole market was in total disarray as many traders left their stores and goods scampering for safety. “Not quite a few minutes later, information filtered out that about three persons from Otor-vwreko including the son of the oldest man reported to have killed during the clash between the two communities.” It was learnt that Ekiugbo and Otor-vwreko communities of Ughelli North had witnessed several clashes in the past over alleged imposition of market levies.
