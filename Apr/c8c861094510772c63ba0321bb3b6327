Manchester United are reportedly in advanced talks to sign Real Madrid centre-back Raphael Varane. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is thought to be searching for a long-term defensive partner for Harry Maguire, and Varane has supposedly been earmarked as the leading candidate for that role. The World Cup-winning Frenchman is out of contract at the Bernabeu in 2022, and if he refuses to commit his future to the club, Real are expected to sell him this summer rather than watch him leave for nothing at the end of next season.  According to Spanish outlet El Chiringuito, talks between the two parties over a deal for Varane are at a very advanced stage, with the former Lens man understood to be keen on a move to the Premier League. Los Blancos are thought to have slapped a £60m price tag on Varane’s head, but they could supposedly be persuaded to lower their asking price in order to recoup a fee for the 27-year-old this summer. Varane has scored two goals from 36 appearances across all competitions for Zinedine Zidane’s side this term, but he missed both of Real Madrid’s Champions League quarter-final legs with Liverpool after testing positive for coronavirus.
