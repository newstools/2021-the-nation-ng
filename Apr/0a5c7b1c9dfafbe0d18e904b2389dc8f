The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said the death of Afenifere spokesman Comrade Yinka Odumakin was a loss of a patriot who was relentless in canvassing and serving the interests and progress of the country. In a condolence statement in Abuja on Saturday by the party’s Secretary, Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the party said Odumakin will be sorely missed. Akpanudoedehe said: “On behalf of the National Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, party leaders, members and supporters, we extend our condolences to the late Odumakin’s immediate family, particularly his wife, Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin and Afenifere. “The Yoruba nation and indeed the country have lost a seasoned public analyst, activist, politician and patriot, who was relentless in canvassing and serving the interests of Yorubaland and the progress of the country at large. He will be sorely missed.”
