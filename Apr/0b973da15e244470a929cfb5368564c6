Nigerian youngster Terem Moffi scored a brilliant hat trick, the first of his Lorient and Ligue 1 career as Lorient thrashed Samuel Kalu’s Girondins de Bordeaux 4-1 at the Stade du Moustoir yesterday.
The 21-year-old smashed home his 12th , 13th  and 14th  league goal to keep Lorient in 17th  place in the league-four  points above the relegation zone. Moffi struck his first of the afternoon in the 20th  minute to double the home side’s advantage moments after Yoane Wissa had opened the scoring. And just before halftime, Moffi made it three for Les Merlus after racing to a Trevoh Chalobah through ball before placing a composed finish past goalkeeper Benoit Costil. Moffi’s third in the 80th  minute was brilliant as he received the ball totally alone in the Bordeaux half, surrounded by Blue shirts, but he had the awareness of space and time to weave his way into a shooting position and curl a brilliant strike into the far corner of the net from outside the box   The former KV Kortrijk forward’s latest efforts in his maiden campaign in France put him one goal ahead of Super Eagles top striker Victor Osimhen’s tally for Lille last term. Osimhen hit the back of the net 13 times for Les Dogues in Ligue 1 before sealing a multi-million euro move to Napoli last summer. Moffi is now fifth  on the league goals chart but second  in goals-per minutes at one-goal per 120 minutes, only behind Mbappe who has one- goal per 88 minutes. He is also the fifth Nigerian to score three or more goals in the French top division after Peter Odemwingie, John Utaka (x3), Victor Agali and Josh Maja.
