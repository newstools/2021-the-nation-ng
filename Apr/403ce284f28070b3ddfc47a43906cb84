Victor Osimhen has welcomed the growing competition for places in Nigeria’s striking department, praising fellow strikers Paul Onuachu, Kelechi Iheanacho and Sadiq Umar as they enjoy fine seasons in Europe. Over the weekend, Onuachu continued his superb form, hitting a brace for Genk in their 3-2 loss at Royal Antwerp. It was his sixth goal in five games, and his ninth in 10 games for the Belgian club. The goals took the forward’s league tally to 29 for the season and 33 in all competitions, including the two he scored for Nigeria during the last international break. Iheanacho has had his career ups and downs, but is now enjoying a breakout season with Leicester City. The former junior international has scored 10 goals in his last seven appearances for the Foxes. Umar scored his 16th goal of the season for Spanish Segunda division side Almeria over the weekend, as they continue their push for promotion to La Liga. All of these performances have impressed Osimhen, who has been established as Gernot Rohr’s first-choice Nigeria striker. The forward is welcoming the competition, and says it is good for the national team. “I think they are all doing quite well — Paul Onuachu, Kelechi Iheanacho and Sadiq Umar,” he told ESPN. “Of course I am happy for them and I’m happy about their form. “And of course, being able to capitalize on their current form for the national team is really important. Kelechi has been doing quite well and he has been scoring goals. Onuachu also, I think he’s the leading goalscorer in Europe which is very important. “He gave us the winning goal in the game against Benin Republic. It shows that we can capitalize on their form and count on them.”
