The Ogun Police have arrested a 49 -year-old man, Ubong Williams Akpan, for routinely defiling his 12 -year- old daughter. Ubong claimed his wife appeared to be looking quite old and was no longer attractive to him, which made him resort to sleeping with his daughter. Detectives arrested him on March 2 when the girl reported the illicit sex to the Divisional Police Officer at Itele Ota, Monday Unoegbe, a Chief Superintendent of Police(CSP). She told the Police her father has been abusing her sexually since she was seven-year-old. She stated further she could not bear it any longer and had to report him to the Police. Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has given a directive for the transfer of the case to the family support unit of Ota area Command for further investigation and prosecution. He also directed that the victim be taken to the general hospital for medical examination and treatment.
