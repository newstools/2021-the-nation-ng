Container terminal operator, APM Terminals Apapa, has invested about  N168 billion since it took over the terminal in 2006, it was learnt. The N168 billion investment, it was gathered, is the  highest investment by any terminal operator in the country. As part of its fresh investment of $80million for the year 2020-2021, the terminal, it was gathered, has acquired seven new forklifts to facilitate quick cargo clearance at port. The equipment will boost Customs examination and improve the movement of heavy materials at the terminal. Its Chief Operating Officer, Steen Knudsen, said the new equipment, which includes six five tonnes and one 16 tonnes forklifts, will enable the efficient performance of tasks at the Customs examination bay and other units without having to share forklifts with other teams. As part of its fleet renewal and expansion programme, the terminal operator has acquired additional cargo handling equipment, including seven Reach Stackers, two Empty Handlers, two Mobile Harbour Cranes and four Rubber Tyred Gantry Cranes (RTGs). With the new acquisitions, APM Terminals Apapa now has 27 RTGs, 13 Mobile Harbour Cranes (MHCs), several reach stackers, forklifts, empty handlers and specialised terminal trucks in operation. This effectively makes it the best-equipped port terminal in the country. Knudsen told The Nation that the terminal has also rolled out a talent development programme which includes functional training for all its employees. “Our engineering maintenance team are undergoing industrial automation and control training for better optimisation of the latest RTG fleet and other equipment. The functional training is in phases and cuts across all departments,” he said. He said the management has embarked on digitisation of its operations and services through the deployment of 4G LTE wireless network and the construction of a new Operation Command Centre (OCC) to enhance service delivery.
