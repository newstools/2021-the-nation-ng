Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun has described his Borno counterpart, Prof. Babagana Zulum, as a man of strong character and conviction who is determined to carry on despite the daunting security challenges in his area. Osun Governor said but for his strong character and conviction, the enormous security challenges in the State were enough for anyone to run away. Oyetola spoke in Ibadan yesterday at the 2021 Luncheon and Awards ceremony of the University of Ibadan Alumni Association, where  Zulum was honoured by the association as both Most Distinguished Alumnus and the Alumus of the Year. “From the documentary we just watched, I can see that the governor in less than two years has done tremendously well. And like we all know, the reward for hard work is more work. I believe this award will spur him to do more great things for the people of Borno. I congratulate you for these honours. You truly deserve them” Oyetola said.  Zulum on his part, thanked the Alumni Association for the award, saying the honour would encourage him to improve on the tempo of service delivery in the State. On his part, the Chairman of the occasion and former Health minister, Prof. Isaac Adewole, commended Zulum for carrying on from where his predecessor, Senator Kashim Shettima, left off. He commended Shettima for discovering Zulum, just as he described Oyetola as a magician, saying most times he wonders how the Governor manages to pay salaries and still carry on with infrastructure development across all sectors of the economy in the State. Prof. Adewole said that with persons like Zulum and Oyetola as Governor of their respective States, there is hope for Nigeria.
