 ON-AIR-PERSONALITY, Toke Makinwa has submitted that it is complicated to find a perfect and single man. The 36-year-old OAP whose marriage to failed six years ago, took to her Twitter handle to lament how hard it has become to get a single and perfect man. “Can a girl just get some good “D” with no complications, like!” she began.  Continuing, Toke said, “There always has to be one nut unscrewed yho…If he ain’t ugly, got some baby mama drama, fighting some financial demons, spiritual too. Married or unsure of his status, (he might be single but someone somewhere is dating him), there has to be some unfinished business! Fix it, Lord. “Once you hear “it’s complicated” after you’ve asked a question, your head starts spinning into different directions, like nobody wants to inherit your complications, can I just find a unicorn.” Since her marriage to Ayida failed in 2015, Makinwa has kept her love interest secret.
