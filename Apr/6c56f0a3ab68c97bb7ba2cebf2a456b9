Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said Edinson Cavani is “unsure” about his Manchester United future amid interest from Boca Juniors. Sources have told ESPN that Cavani is “closer than ever” to agreeing a deal with Boca rather than extending his stay at Old Trafford into a second season. Speaking ahead of the trip to Tottenham on Sunday, Solskjaer hinted that the decision is in Cavani’s hands and that the 34-year-old was yet to inform the club of his plans. “I’ve kept in touch with Edi of course,” Solskjaer said. “We keep an open dialogue and he’s still unsure what he wants to do next season, which I find fine. It’s not been an easy year either for him or the rest of the world, this season, so he still wants time to make his mind up. “I’m very sure we will get the good version of Edinson for the rest of the season. He knows this is the business end of season. “He’s been so positive in and around the place, he’s been great to have.” United’s trip to Tottenham will be the first time they have faced Jose Mourinho’s side since the 6-1 defeat at Old Trafford in October.
