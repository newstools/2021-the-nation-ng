Lagos State Government will continue to place premium on human capital development, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said. The governor, speaking yesterday at the launch of the Learning Management System (LMS), in Alausa, Ikeja, said with over 42,000 workforce, the need for continuing training and retraining in the civil service was necessary. He said: “The launch of the LMS is a crystallisation of the reform process, which our administration initiated to improve service delivery in public administration and governance. It is not by chance that the Lagos State Public Service is globally acclaimed as a pacesetter among other public administration and governance services in Nigeria and Africa.”  Sanwo-Olu said his administration placed premium on the competence of the public service to deliver government policies, strategies and programmes for the benefit of the people. Head of Service (HOS) Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola said he would not make a mistake to say the launch of LMS marked one of the happiest days in his life, adding that it would enhance the learning process of public servants irrespective of their cadre and distance. Establishments, Training and Pensions Commissioner Ajibola Ponnle said implementing a learning management system for the government was not just to have a global trend, but also a radical change that was at the root of repairing public service delivery failure in the state.
