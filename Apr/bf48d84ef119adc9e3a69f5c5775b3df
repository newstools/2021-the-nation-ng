National Assembly workers under the auspices of Parliamentary Staff Association on Nigeria (PASAN) have threatened to commence an indefinite industrial action on Tuesday if the management fails to meet their demands. Also, some legislative aides announced plans to protest at the National Assembly over unpaid salaries and allowances. The Senate and the House of Representatives had on March 25, 2021, adjourned plenary till April 13, 2021 to enable members celebrate Easter. The workers, during a congress on Monday, resolved to down tools following expiration of the 21-day ultimatum they gave the management. A source close to the management however told The Nation last night the management was still in talks with the workers to avert the strike. The Clerk to the National Assembly, Arch. Olatunde Ojo, had on March 21 set up an implementation committee to address workers agitations to avert the pending industrial action. The move followed a 14-day ultimatum handed down by PASAN where it threatened to down tools if the issues concerned were not addressed as at 31st March 2021. Chairman of PASAN, National Assembly Chapter, Mr. Sunday Sabiyi, had said the pending staff welfare issues that needed to be urgently addressed include non-payment of 22 months minimum wage arrears. Sabiyi noted other staff demand that needed urgent implementation are rent subsidy at 40 per cent of consolidated annual salary, hazard allowance at five per cent of consolidated monthly salary, gratuity for every retiring staff and pending promotion arrears. The workers resolved to begin the strike at noon on Tuesday if their demands were not met.
