VICE President Yemi Osinbajo and Federal minister, Babatunde Raji Fashola have commended the launch of The Company’s new studio, Ogidi studios. Osinbajo, in a video, described the studio as a revolution in entertainment production while praising the founder, Idris Olorunnibe, and his team. “With the Ogidi Studios, Nigeria now operates on the same level of sound and video technology with major global players. Now the stars, not just Nigerian stars, but from all over the world have a place in Lagos that is as good as any studio they have ever recorded in,” he said. Prof Osinbajo added, “World-class script writing, music recording, video making, and editing, can take place under one roof, at the Ogidi Studios. The entire value chain in music and entertainment can now be local. So, we are at the cusp of a revolution in entertainment production, creative talent and services, and a major economic opening for business in Nigeria. In his speech, Federal Minister for Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola said the infrastructure is consistent with the government of the Buhari’s administration to revamp, expand and improve on Nigeria’s infrastructure as a critical driver for national economy and growth.” He also observed, “I have had the opportunity to visit and I’m truly impressed by what I have seen. I can only now say that may the winds go behind your sail as you open this studio as you open this studio to Nigerians, Africans, and indeed people of races as a platform to express what essentially their divinely given talent is. Also to the contributions that you would make to Nigeria, sub-regional and African economy.”
