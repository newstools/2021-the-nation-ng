 Since the immediate past Olu of Warri, Ogiame Ikenwoli 1 Godfrey Emiko joined his ancestors in 202, there has been controversy and animosity surrounding the selection process of the Olu of Warri designate. After consulting the oracle and carrying out an extensive background check of various candidates who showed interest, the selection team headed by the Iyatsere of Warri kingdom and the acting chairman of Warri Council of Chiefs and the Olu Advisory Council, Chief Johnson Amatserunreleghe, settled for Prince Utieyinoritsetsola Emiko as the Olu of Warri designate.  On announcing the young Emiko, the news spread like wildfire as jubilation engulfed the ancient city on the newest development. However, the emergence of the young Emiko didn’t sit well with some of the kingmakers claiming the process was marred with anomalies and discrepancies. The animosity among the chiefs and kingmakers heralded two factions – those for and those against. Leading the faction against the emergence of Prince Emiko is the suspended Ologbotsere of Warri Kingdom (Traditional Prime Minister) Chief Ayiri Emami. The emergence of the Olu of Warri designate does not sit well with Emami, whose body language can be felt across the Warri kingdom. Sources, however, alleged that Ayiri’s unspoken grouse with Prince Emiko is his relationship with Benin oil baron, Captain Wells Idahosa Okunbo. The Olu of Warri designate is the son-in-law to the Benin billionaire and he’s alleged to be enjoying financial and moral backing from the ailing oil baron. It was further alleged that Ayiri is unsettled over the possible influence Okunbo’s relationship with the Olu of Warri designate will have on the kingdom. As it stands, a cold rift is brewing between Ayiri and Okunbo and none is hoping to throw in the towel as indigenes look forward to a coronation soon. Meanwhile, Ayiri has maintained that his suspension as Ologbotsere remains null and void when his authority was queried.
