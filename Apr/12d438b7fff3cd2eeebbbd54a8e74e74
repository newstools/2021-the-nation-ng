Calm and serenity have returned to the Soka Ibadan residence of Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho, on Monday. The house was allegedly attacked by gunmen on Monday morning. When The Nation visited the residence, it was observed normalcy had returned as many of Igboho’s men were seen chatting in different parts of the quiet street. As usual, all adjourning roads to the residence remained quiet with a handful of individuals going about their normal activities.  It was gathered from those in the area that there were indeed gunshots at the midnight but they couldn’t who the gunmen were. Another person, who stays in the adjourning street, said it was observed the gunmen were in black hoods but their mission was unsure. When The Nation moved around the vicinity, bullet cartridges were seen inside the front drainage of the Igboho residence. It was also observed broken bottles were seen on different parts of the road.  A source close to the residence informed since the attack on the old residence of the activist, certain individuals have been noticed patrolling the area with an unknown mission.
