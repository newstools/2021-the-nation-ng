Ride-hailing platform, Univasa, has expanded its services to Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The launch which took place at the capital city last Thursday also doubled as a roundtable discussion with stakeholders, following the line of successful launches in Lagos, Edo and Rivers states. It came with delight for both drivers and users who got their first ride 100 per cent free. Univasa’s CEO, Dr Ben Adeniyi, said Univasa’s commitment was to make rides safe for drivers and rider partners with the company having several features in the application that make the dream possible. He said: “We want to change the transportation industry, give our partners higher returns while ensuring their safety, and we are committed to using technology and innovation to drive this sector. That is what has formed today’s expansion and we are still moving. We are looking forward to partnerships that will create jobs, provide security and safety when it comes to transportation and we are not backing out from this quest.” The drivers present at the launch expressed happiness at having more opportunities to offer services to riders in the city. Also speaking at the event, the company’s General Manager, Mr John Oyakhilome, revealed that a close relationship with drivers is one of the features that differentiate Univasa from others. ‘We treat our drivers as partners, we make them unique. They decide how the market operates and we have one-on-one communication with them because they are stakeholders,’ he said. Univasa Nigeria Limited is a Lagos-based company focusing on development of ICT with various private organisations. It is set to launch the platform with drivers and riders in Abuja in coming weeks.
