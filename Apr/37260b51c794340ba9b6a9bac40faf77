Founder of Cleen Foundation, Innocent Chukwuma, is dead. He died on Saturday evening at 55 after he was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, an aggressive cancer of the blood. His long time friend and associate, Edetaen Ojo, confirmed the sad incident. Ojo, the Executive Director of the Media Rights Agenda(MRA), said: “With profound shock & sadness, I regret to inform you that Innocent Chukwuma passed away a few hours ago, in the evening of April 3. May his soul rest in peace.” Chukwuma read religious studies at the University of Nigeria (UNN) but gained prominence as a student union leader. He was a founding member of the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) before he started CLEEN foundation. The father of three daughters was just diagnosed with the cancer on Friday night but died before he could begin scheduled chemotherapy sessions on Saturday night.
