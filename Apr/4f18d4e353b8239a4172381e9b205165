A 35-year-old man Umaru Jibrin has allegedly stabbed and killed the Chief Imam of Enagi town, Alhaji Attahiru Alhassan over a suspected sexual affair with Jibrin’s second wife Aisha Umar. Jubrin allegedly caught the 48-year-old Imam and his wife in bed in a neighbour’s house. Jubrin who was paraded at the police headquarters in Minna on Tuesday said the Chief Imam walked past him to a neighbour’s house, where his wife also ended up after telling him she was going to relieve herself behind the compound. He explained that when he did not see his wife for about an hour, he went in search of her and heard her voice in the neighbour’s house. “I entered and met the Chief Imam naked on the bed with my wife. They were sleeping together. I didn’t do anything, I left them and went to my brother’s house to report what I saw.” Jubrin further explained that he became aggravated when the Chief Imam called him for a dialogue over the incident. “In the course of the discussion, things became heated, we argued with each other and I forcefully collected the iron rod with Alhaji Alhassan and stabbed him in the neck.” Jubrin reportedly fled after killing the cleric but was chased and apprehended. Police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said investigation had started.
