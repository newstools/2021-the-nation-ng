Hundreds of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have blocked the Makurdi-Lafia highway over alleged killing of 10 persons by herdsmen in their camp on Monday night. They blocked the highway with corpses of the killed inmates, causing a gird lock on the busy expressway. Governor Samuel, who showed up at the highway, appealed to the protesters to open the expressway for traffic flow.
