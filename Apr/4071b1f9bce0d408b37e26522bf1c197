 Rita Dominic has rewarded three budding actors with a cumulative sum of N1.4 million a few weeks after throwing out an acting challenge. The La Femme Anjola protagonist, in collaboration with Heritage Bank, presented the cheques to the budding actors, who emerged as winners of her first-ever acting Rita Dominic acting challenge. Jasmine Wrights, Chioma Okafor, and Josh Anowi, who came winner, first and second runner up respectively, were presented with cheques of N1 million, N300,000, and N100,000 respectively at a mini-event, which had the film’s director, Mildred Okwo, and representatives of Heritage bank in attendance. Speaking at the event, Dominic said, “When I first started acting in Nollywood 23 years ago, it was very difficult after finishing school. So, my dream was to find a way to give opportunities to upcoming actors so they don’t have to go through the rigorous process.  For so many years, I didn’t have the opportunity to bring my dream to life, so luckily, Heritage bank came on board and partnered with us this year and I felt this is a fantastic opportunity to bring to life this long-life dream and with the help of my business partner and director, we decided to put out a monologue from our new film, La Femme Anjola, that whoever does win will have an opportunity to feature in our next project aside winning a prize. It was difficult because we had several entries and I will tell you that we have lots of talents in this country but at the end of the day Jasmine won.” The winners of the challenge were announced on Monday, April 5, 2021, by Dominic after a rigorous process that had Mildred Okwo, Ego Boyo, and Femi Jacobs as judges. Dominic also reiterated that the winner of the challenge, Jasmine Wrights will be featured in Mildred Okwo’s next film under The Audrey Silver Company’s production outfit.
