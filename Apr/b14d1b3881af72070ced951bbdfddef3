The Ogun State Security Network, otherwise known as Amotekun Corps, on Thursday commenced operations towards helping tackling banditry, criminal herders, rituals and kidnapping for ransom. The corps with David Akinremi, a retired Commissioner of Police as the Commander, is expected to take security more to the remote areas identified as the soft targets for attacks by bandits, kidnappers and criminal herders. The Nation had reported the Bill establishing it was passed by the Ogun Assembly in March 2020 barely 19 days after receiving it from Governor Dapo Abiodun. The Governor is expected to inaugurate the corps and Patrol vehicles on Thursday afternoon at the Arcade Ground, Okemosan, to enhance the operativesâ€™ readiness to meet their mandate.
