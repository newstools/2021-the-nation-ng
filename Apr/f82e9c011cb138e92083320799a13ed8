 Seyi Shay failed to hold back her emotions as she professed her love for a contestant on the last episode of the audition round of the ongoing Nigerian Idol. The only female judge on the sixth edition of Nigerian Idol gushed her feelings for guitarist and singer Faith Jason, who got the last of the 65 gold tickets to qualify for the next round of the music and talent hunt reality TV show. “I love your voice, I love your ability to combine playing the guitar with singing and you look good. I love you,” the songstress gushed. After being awed by Faith’s performance, Seyi stood up from her middle seat to personally present the gold ticket to an equally elated Faith.  After Faith exited the audition ground, Seyi couldn’t hold back her joy as she told her co-judges, Obi Asika, and DJ Sose, how she felt happy with the performance of the 27-year-old Faith saying, “I am so happy that I have found the last of my favourites. I think I have five now and this one, Faith, blew me away. Yeah, this is what I am talking about, the next round will be so interesting.” The last audition episode, which aired on Sunday night, April 18, was packed with lots of drama and excitement. Though there were a couple of not-so-great performances, some contestants in this round performed well enough to get a gold ticket from the judges.
