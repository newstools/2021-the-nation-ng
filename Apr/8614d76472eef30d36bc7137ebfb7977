Immediate past Ondo Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi has returned three official vehicles in his possession. Ajayi had held on to the vehicles, claiming they were part of his benefits. He had earlier claimed he had only two official vehicles in his possession. But Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had threatened to embarrass Ajayi if he refused to return the vehicles. Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, in a statement issued on Monday night listed the vehicles returned to include a Toyota Landcruiser Jeep, V8, 2019 model and two Toyota Hilux vans also of 2019 model. Ojogo said efforts were on to recover any other remaining vehicle still in possession of Ajayi. The statement thanked the security agencies ‘for the most-needed intervention.’
