For the past five years, sports and fitness enthusiasts globally have been gathering to participate in the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon(ABLCM). This year edition holds on Saturday, April 10, 2021. To uphold COVID-19 safety guidelines and ensure the safety of participants, only 300 runners made up of local and international elite runners and selected persons from professional running bodies will be eligible to run the 42KM race. Provisions have been made for the larger public to participate in the 10KM race virtually. The theme is ‘stronger together’ drawing from the rationale, according to organisers, that “we’ve held on strongly together and survived the gruesome effects of the pandemic–from the closure of businesses, lockdowns and restrictions, to loss of lives and livelihoods. “These happenings have pushed us as a nation and individuals to the edge but slowly and surely, we’ll spring up stronger and better than we were.” Registered individuals can take part in the virtual 10km race anywhere between the 9th of April to 11th of April, 2021 and share pictures on their social media platforms to show that they’re part of the unique event. Although not on the street, people can still cheer the runners from the comfort of their homes as the event will be widely broadcasted on multi-media platforms. The FiNerge app is more than just a registration platform for the marathon. It offers activities such as yoga, bicycling, weight management and other lifestyle-enhancing functionalities. Access Bank’s keenness to give its customers a ‘more than banking’ experience has shown once again through this great sporting initiative amongst others. In its five years of existence, the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon has grown exponentially and gained recognition from reputable bodies across the world like the IAAF, earning a silver label. The marathon seeks to promote tourism and sustainable/healthy living among Lagosians, Nigerians and Africans at large.
