The Super Eagles vice-captain William Troost-Ekong featured prominently as Watford secured a 1-0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in Friday’s Championship game. The 27-year-old was handed his 26th league start in the encounter and formed a four-man defence for the Hornets along with Kiko, Francisco Sierralta and Adam Masina. The centre-back delivered a solid defensive performance to help Xisco Munoz’s men to keep a clean sheet and nick their sixth win on the bounce. Troost-Ekong only recently returned from international duty with the Nigeria national team and played a key role as the side secured back-to-back victories over the Republic of Benin and Lesotho. Watford hit the ground running in the encounter and were rewarded for their fine start when Tom Lees was forced to turn the ball into his own net in the seventh minute. The own-goal proved decisive as it determined the outcome of the game with no further goals in the encounter. Troost-Ekong featured for the duration of the game, won two aerial contests, had 55 touches on the ball, made one clearance and one interception.
