President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation Daniel Igali has hinted on plans to engage the services of a foreign coach to prepare the wrestlers ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. Igali revealed this to NationSport yesterday at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos on arrival of the wrestling contingent from Tunisia, where the team secured four more Olympic tickets at the just concluded Africa/Oceania Olympic Qualifiers in Hammamet. Ekerekeme Agiomor (86kg), Blessing Oborududu (68kg), Aminat Adeniyi (62kg) and teenager Adijat Idris (50kg) joined already qualified Odunayo Adekuoroye (57kg) to the global sports fiesta. Igali, who hopes to secure more Olympic slots for the wrestlers at the 2021 World Wrestling Olympic Qualification Tournament billed to hold in Sofia, Bulgaria from May 6–9, 2021, believes with adequate preparations, the wrestlers are guaranteed podium finish at the Games. Igali said: “I would be having some discussions with the minister; there are one or two things I saw that I think we can improve on. I may likely bring in somebody, a coach to support the team I have, even if it’s for six weeks, before the Olympics and I already have someone in mind. A coach that will come and booster the team and work on some deficiencies that I see because I don’t really have the time. I go and support them and do whatever I can. At least I spend about 30 minutes with them almost at every training session, but I don’t have the necessary and required time to maximize the effort. So I’m going to look at having a discussion with the minister to bring somebody. The Sydney 2000 Olympic gold medalist however, said that several international competitions and camps have been lined up for the athletes in their readiness for the Olympic Games in Japan.
