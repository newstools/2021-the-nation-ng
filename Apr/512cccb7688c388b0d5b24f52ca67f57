Enyimba striker Anayo Iwuala has warned his teammates of the consequence of playing under pressure as they confront Orlando Pirates of South Africa in their must-win CAF Confederation Cup Group A tie today in Aba by 10pm. Iwuala who made his debut for the Super Eagles in the 2021 AFCON qualifier against  Benin Republic last month opined that they must approach the game with the calmness of minds and not allow the craving4 pm for goals to serve as distractions. “It a must-win for us, we need to suppress the pressure a little bit, and we have to work together to make sure we get the win in any way we can. With the position of things now it’s more pressure for us, in a way, but we don’t have any choice than just to look for a way to get the win come Wednesday night,” Iwuala told the club’s official website. Meanwhile, coach Fatai Osho has  played down  the pressure ahead of the cracker with Orlando Pirates, insisting all the four teams in the group have a chance to qualify. He said: “Every team in the group should be under pressure because every other team in the group still has a healthy chance of qualification, so you don’t go to sleep at all because you know you have to work hard on the last day to earn your qualification,” Osho told the club’s official website.
