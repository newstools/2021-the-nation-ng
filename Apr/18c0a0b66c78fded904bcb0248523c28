The Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC) has launched its Future of Work Academy (FOWA). Its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Chizor Malize, said: “The world of work is changing rapidly, and competition for the right talent is fierce. Graduate talents have for decades been primarily identified and employed based on academic excellence, however, in the emerging world of work, creativity, innovation, and work ready skills have become the non-negotiable indicators for competitive advantage, and to evaluate capabilities. “It is, therefore, important for youths to build critical skills that will equip them for the requirements of the Future of Work in the ever-evolving business landscape. The value FITC FOWA is bringing to corporations at this time cannot be overemphasised. By equipping youths and creating a pool of well engaged workforce for organisations, FITC FOWA will be  strengthening the economy and the society in general.” Last July, FITC launched its Youth Connect Initiatives to create a platform for youths.  The 2020 Youth Connect Essay Competition,  its flagship programme, was organised for undergraduates in higher institutions of learning. FITC FOWA is designed to be instructor-led, with participants having access to interact with the academy’s world-class facilitators, participate in class exercises, hands-on sessions, and real-time assessments.
