The founder of Believers Loveworld Ministries aka Christ Embassy, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, has become a grandfather following the birth of his first grandchild. Oyakhilome’s new status comes as his first daughter Sharon and her Ghanaian husband Phillip Frimpong welcomed a baby girl. Frimpong announced their first child’s birth on Instagram on Thursday, revealing her name as Arielle Rachelle-Marise Frimpong. The Nation had reported sometime in November, 2017 of Sharon’s engagement to her heartthrob. Sharon married Frimpong on October 6, 2018. Her mother Anita Ebhodaghe, who is divorced from Oyakhilome, was reportedly absent at the wedding.
