A 35- year- old man, Umaru Jibrin, has stabbed the Chief Imam of Enagi town, Alhaji Attahiru Alhassan, to death for allegedly having a sexual relationship with his second wife, Aisha Umar. Jubrin caught the 48-year-old Imam and his wife in bed together in a neighbour’s house. Jubrin, who was paraded at the Police Headquarters in Minna on Tuesday, said on the day he caught the Chief Imam and his wife, Alhassan had walked past him into a neighbour’s house. Almost at the same time, he said his wife told him she was going to a toilet behind the compound. He explained when he did not see his wife for about an hour, he decided to go searching for her and he heard her voice in the neighbour’s house. Jubrin explained he became aggravated when the Chief Imam called him for dialogue over the incident and was not ready to take any blame that he did wrong. “In the course of the discussion, things became heated, we argued with each other and I forcefully collected the iron rod with Alhaji Alhassan and stabbed him in the neck,” he said. Jubrin took to his heels but was apprehended at Batati village in Lavun local government area. Youths of Enagi town, The Nation learnt, mobilised to the Police station in an attempt to lynch the suspect, forcing operatives to take him down to the Police Headquarters in Minna. Speaking while paraded in Minna, Jubrin said that he regretted his action as he did not know it will lead to the Imam’s death. Briefing newsmen at the Police Headquarters, the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, said the suspect confessed he killed the Imam in the bout of anger.
