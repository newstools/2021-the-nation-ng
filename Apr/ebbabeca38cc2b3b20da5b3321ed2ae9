The National Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists has kicked against exclusion from the negotiation of upward review of Covid-19 hazard allowances for frontline health workers in the fight against COVID-19. The association’s President, Prof James Damen, faulted Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, for excluding the union, accusing him of using divide and rule tactics in the negotiations for upward review of the allowances. Ngige met with the leadership of the Nigeria Medical Association, Joint Health Sector Unions and Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa on Wednesday. But Damen argued that laboratory scientists who collect samples and have direct link to patients shouldn’t have been excluded in the talks to review hazard allowance for health workers in the country.
