Thomas Tuchel has admitted Tammy Abraham could find it tough to break back into a Chelsea side that gained massive momentum while the England striker was out injured. Abraham has only just shaken off a niggling ankle problem suffered in the 2-0 Premier League win over Newcastle on February 15. Chelsea have lost just once in Tuchel’s 15 matches in charge, with Abraham missing the bulk of those games. Academy graduate Abraham remains Chelsea’s top scorer in all competitions this term with 12 goals, though Mason Mount has topped the charts under new manager Tuchel. “Tammy had a bit of a rough time because twice he was substituted at half-time for tactical changes,” said Tuchel. “So he could not have the impact that he demands from himself, we wish from him and he can clearly give for us.
