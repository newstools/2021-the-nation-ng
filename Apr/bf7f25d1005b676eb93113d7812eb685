Baobab Microfinance Bank has launched a scholarship programme to foot the bill of 50 female students in order to increase attendance of girl-child education in northern Nigeria. Chief Risk Officer of the bank, Tunde Omolere, said the gesture, which paved the way for commencement of the ‘Girl Child Scholarship,’ would lead to the sponsorship of female students in different schools annually. Omolere, who spoke at the presentation of a cheque to Elijah Future Stars Academy in Karu, Nassarawa state, explained the initiative was in line with the bank’s vision to support girls in their educational pursuit. He stated the benefitting school had no prior contact with the bank but was selected due to the low tuition fee it charges, thus, bearing the hallmark of a school for the less privileged. Omolere said: “Selection of schools was thrown open to our staff and we asked them to look at schools that charge ridiculously low school fees but making impact. We understand that some parents are not able to afford the fee. So, we wanted the schools to be micro schools for us to intervene.” He added that over N250, 000 would be spent on the students. The Country Human Resource Manager for the bank, Priscilla Okoko, noted as important as education is, it was often overlooked by some parents, especially where the female child is concerned. She disclosed that the bank’s plan is to help the girl – child break the glass ceiling in Nigeria by giving them the opportunity to further their education. One of the beneficiaries of the scholarship, Nafisat Omale, commended management of the bank. She said the scholarship has inspired her to work harder, promising to come top of her class. Proprietor of the School, Bishop Fred Kaka, commended the initiative, saying it would encourage more female students to stay in school as parents default in the payment of school fees of their wards due to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19.
