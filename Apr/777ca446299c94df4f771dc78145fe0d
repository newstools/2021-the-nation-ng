Some residents of Igisogba area of Akure South Local Government Area of Ondo state have been rendered homeless after Sundayâ€™s rainstorm destroyed their houses. Also affected in the area were churches, shops and electricity poles. Roofs of the affected houses were blown off. The rainstorm, which was said to have lasted 45 minutes, also caused a power outage in the area. The incident paralysed social life with the morale of residents at the lowest ebb. Many of the affected residents said they managed to squat with their neighbours or family members. Chairman of Igisogba Landlord Association, Mr Ebenezer Ojo, urged Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to help affected landlords.
