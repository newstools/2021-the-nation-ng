Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola denies they’re favourites for the Champions League. City meet PSG in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal tomorrow night. Guardiola said: “We are not in the elite of this competition, but we want to be there for sure. The owners, when they took over, wanted to take us there in England first, and we are lucky to live where we are now. “I am incredibly happy to travel to Paris with this club to try and win and then to Crystal Palace to try and win one of the two games that we need to win the title.” He added: “The Premier League is the most important one, but the Champions League is the nicest one I think. “For most of these players, it is the first time in this stage of the competition, so you have to focus on he game and the weak points that they have. That is the idea that we are travelling with. Everyone is fit, ready and happy. “We are all grateful to have this opportunity. At some clubs this is normal, some have many Champions Leagues and this is normality, but for us it is new and we are grateful for it. It is incredible, it is so nice to go to Paris.”
