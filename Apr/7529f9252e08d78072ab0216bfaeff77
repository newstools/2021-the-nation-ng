Grammy nominee and Music Exec Bankuli has disclosed plans to launch a documentary titled ‘Chronicles of Afrobeats.’ According to him, the documentary will tell the tales and origin of Afrobeats and also feature people that contributed to the globally acknowledged genre of music. Bankuli made this known during an Instagram live talk with On-Air Personality, Adesope Olajide recently. The music exec said “It is very important for us to document our story because people that came together to push the idea from the beginning are still alive. It makes more sense for us to document what happened then and we were able to pinpoint the story back then, we took it as far back as highlife, far back as mike Okri, and even when Ajegunle music was reigning, Daddy Showkey, Chris Okotie, even too as far back as Pretty and Junior which were the first Afrobeats artist that was signed to a premier music label in the world. They started investing in what we call Afrobeats. We also took it to as far back as 2baba, moments that happened during Oliver Twist Dbanj, Mohits, and of course, there are a lot of unsung heroes that are lying there and a lot of people do not see around the world.” Bankuli who is currently in the United States of America filming the documentary revealed his meeting with renowned Nigerian music producer Femi Ojetunde who had worked with Sunny Ade, Onyeka Owenu, and top American hip-hop legends.
