The Deputy Governor of Kwara State Kayode Alabi yesterday said he was optimistic his state’s team would win more gold medals at the ongoing 20th National Sports Festival (NSF). Alabi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) shortly after Team Kwara won a gold medal in squash men’s singles event he was elated with their performance so far. The deputy governor said his optimism that Team Kwara would excel spurred him to be in Benin to cheer the contingent to more victories. “I came here to cheer them (Team Kwara), so that they can be happy and more productive. Sports is one of the ways of uplifting people out of poverty.  “It also encourages youths to leave the streets. “So, I feel great about it (winning two gold and a bronze medal) and I believe we will win more. Mark my words,” he said. Alabi added that the present administration in the state was doing great in the task of restoring Kwara’s lost glory in sports. “We just came in two years ago and we have a new policy on sports, and if you come to Kwara now, you will see that we are fixing all our facilities for volleyball, basketball and football. “This is to encourage more people to come into sports,” he said. The Kwara deputy governor also promised that the state would begin in August and complete the renovation of the indoor sports hall at the stadium complex.
