Walter Frederick “Fritz” Mondale, who served as vice president under then-President Jimmy Carter before waging his own unsuccessful White House bid in 1984, has died, according to a family spokesperson. He was 93. According to sources, Mondale died at home in downtown Minneapolis surrounded by family. And no cause was given for his death. “Well my time has come. I am eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor,” Mondale said in a statement to his staff which was released to the public after his death, referring to his late wife Joan, who died in 2014, and daughter Eleanor, who died in 2011 at age 51. “Before I go I wanted to let you know how much you mean to me.” Mondale served as vice president under Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981.
