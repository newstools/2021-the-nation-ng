One of the top contenders for the Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) Premiership title and ticket for the WAFU B qualifiers for the CAF Women Champions League, Edo Queens FC of Benin lost their second match in the ongoing Super Six to narrow the team’s chance of picking the ticket to continental showpiece. The team lost 2-1 against Sunshine Queens of Akure. The win over Edo Queens has put Sunshine Queens at four-point top of the table lead before the kick-off of the Rivers Angels vs Delta Queens game. A disappointed Edo Queens coach Stanley Osazee said: “The clubs’ top management members are not happy that we don’t have any points after our second game when the plan was to come to Ijebu-Ode to win the title. Anyway we still have the hope of winning our three remaining games and amassing nine points, we should be able to bounce back and achieve our aim.” The major result of the Day Two was the shocking result recorded by lowly rated FC Robo of Lagos as the Coach Emmanuel Osahon Girls defeated NWFL Premiership top rated team and multiple champions, Bayelsa Queens of Yenagoa 2-0. The NFF First Vice president, Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi, was on ground at the Dipo Dina International Stadium, Ijebu-Ode all through yesterday’s games watching the brilliant display of soccer artistry by the six best women’s clubs in Nigeria. Today is a rest day at the NWFL Premiership Super Six as actions will resume tomorrow and continue on Friday before a second rest day on Saturday. The final games will be played simultaneously on Sunday to determine the 2020/2021 season’s champion and the country’s representative to the WAFU B qualifiers for the CAF Women Champions League.
