The Edo State Government has commenced the decontamination of the Games Village, the Samuel Ogbemudia Sports Complex and other sporting facilities used for the hosting of the National Sports Festival. The exercise, according to the State’s COVID-19 Incident Manager, Dr. Andrew Obi, is to prevent another outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the state after the successful hosting of the sports tournament. Obi, who disclosed this during the daily virtual meeting of the State COVID-19 Taskforce, chaired by the state governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, noted that the cleanup and decontamination exercise will be carried by the state’s decontamination team under the supervision of the Project Manager, Games Village for Edo 2020. The Incident Manager said the state also carried out a pre-exit sample collection and testing for contingents to examine the impact that the Games had on the state in terms of spread, adding that the Edo COVID-19 Taskforce effectively managed the Games ensuring compliance with all preventive protocols against the spread of the infectious disease. He maintained that Edo has continued to record a progressive decline in active cases, case positivity and fatality rates as well as an impressive rise in recovery rate, noting “this is an indication that the outbreak has been significantly contained in the state.”
