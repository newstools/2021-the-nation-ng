Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya on Monday blamed the violence which erupted in Billiri in February over the appointment of Mai Tangle which left four people dead, on the spread of fake news. While inaugurating a panel of inquiry to probe the violence, Yahaya said the spread of fake news contributed immensely to the escalation of the violence. According to him, it is in light of this that the Gombe State government  is determined to unravel the causes of the crisis in order to sanction those involved and take necessary measures to prevent future occurrence. The commission’s terms of reference included finding out the remote and immediate causes of the protests; identify person or group of persons who sponsored, procured, instigated, or encouraged the violent protests and recommend sanctions or remedial measures against such person or group of persons. The commission is to receive complaints from victims or the families of victims and members of the public over the violent protests; make appropriate recommendations to the government on how to prevent future occurrence. Yahaya warned against using the panel to witch-hunt anybody in the state. “I am confident that the calibre of people constituted in this commission will discharge their duties with justice and fairness. “Our people should provide the commission with  genuine information in order to move our state forward. Under no circumstances should this exercise be turned into a witch-hunting game,” he said. The Commission has 60 days to submit its report to the government.
