The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) said it impounded 37,100 litres of diesel at an illegal depot in Ore, Odigbo Local Government Area of Ondo State. The Commandant of the corps in the state, Edenabu Eweka, made this known in a statement signed by spokesman of the command, Mr Olufemi Omole, on Tuesday in Akure. Eweka said the discovery and seizure were in line with the Commandant-General of the corps’ vision of zero tolerance for vandalism and destruction of critical national assets and infrastructure. He said the command, through sustained and credible intelligence, burst an “illegal surface” storage facility for Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), also known as diesel, in Ore. Eweka said some criminal elements and economic saboteurs used the arena as a storage base after engaging in oil pipeline vandalism on the high seas and the creeks in the Niger Delta.
