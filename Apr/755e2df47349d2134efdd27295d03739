Singer, songwriter and entertainer Teniola Apata, popularly known as Teni reveals in a live chat why she featured just Davido in her very first album. Her debut album ‘WONDALAND’ was crafted for over two years in cities like London, New York, Orlando, Ondo, Lagos and Abuja; and features guest appearances from DMW boss, Davido. When asked why she featured just one person in her 17-track album, the talented singer who has won quite a number of awards excitedly said: “It had to be Davido. Yo! Davido is such an amazing guy and you know…Big ups to everybody else, cause everybody else shows me love. “But David is special because I’ve known David since Atlanta. And I remember when I met him in a studio session and he said to me, in his exact words, he said: “Go back to Nigeria and you’re going to be a huge star.” So, he motivated me with those words and it was just right for me to do something with him for my first album,” among other things.
