Manchester United came from behind to win at Tottenham with Edinson Cavani scoring a superb diving header. Cavani had a first-half goal controversially disallowed by the video assistant referee after Scott McTominay’s hand hit Son Heung-min’s face – and then Son put Spurs ahead. Fred levelled for United after Hugo Lloris parried Cavani’s shot. Cavani met Mason Greenwood’s cross to put United ahead before Greenwood hammered in a late third. United are in second place, 11 points behind leaders Manchester City, while Spurs remain seventh, six points behind fourth-placed West Ham. BBC
