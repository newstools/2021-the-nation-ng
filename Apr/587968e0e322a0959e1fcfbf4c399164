Some residents of Bayelsa State, particularly those living in Yenagoa, the state capital, have expressed fears over the outbreak of cholera. The Ministry of Health confirmed that no fewer than 30 communities had been hit by the epidemic, which has claimed 19 persons as at Sunday. A resident of Amarata in Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state, Linda, said their fear was borne out the fact there are many cholera triggers in the area. She said some parts of community are unplanned, unkempt and unhygienic with sources of water supply nothing to write home about. Another resident, Ebi, warned if the epidemic should get to the community, many persons would be doomed. It was learnt following the outbreak across 30 communities, Governor Douye Diri had reportedly ordered supply of oral cholera vaccines to stop its spread. Commissioner for Health, Dr Pabara Newton Igwele, said the government has established local governments’ Rapid Response Teams (RRT) to ensure active surveillance and response to any case of acute gastroenteritis or suspected cholera. The statement explained that the state in partnership with the World Health Organisation (WHO) had also sent vaccines to LGA headquarters and select healthcare facilities to support management of the outbreak. The commissioner advised the general public to be calm as the government was working at all levels to control and contain the situation as soon as possible. He added: “The Bayelsa public is also strongly advised to use safe and clean water for drinking and other purposes as well as maintain good personal and environmental hygiene which are critical to prevent and control the transmission of waterborne diseases such as cholera. “We assure all Bayelsans that with the proper care and treatment given by the state government, the outbreak will soon be a thing of the past and the lives of Bayelsans will be preserved.”
