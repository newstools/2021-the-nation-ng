The suspected killer of Benin landlord Imafuen Odiase is still on the run since Saturday evening when the crime was committed. The suspect’s aged mother, his wife and concubine, who were picked up on Sunday, have been moved to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Benin, the state capital, for further investigation. The suspected killer rented an apartment in Odiase’s neighbourhood at Leaders’ College Road, Ugbioko Quarters, Off Ekenwan Road, Benin. Odiase’s younger brother, Edenagboden, an engineer, told our reporter that there were attempts to release the suspect’s mother. Edenagboden said the suspect’s wife fled his house following a disagreement, and later moved in with Odiase as she plotted a divorce from the suspect. The suspect reportedly went to Odiase’s house and threatened him and his estranged wife. Edenagboden alleged that the suspect later mobilised some persons with whom he allegedly killed Odiase. Police spokesman Bello Kontongs had yet to provide details of the incident before press time.
