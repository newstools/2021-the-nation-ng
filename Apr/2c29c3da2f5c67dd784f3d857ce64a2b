A Lagos-based Pastor, Frederick Ojo Aramuwa, has been killed by his abductors after collecting N2m ransom. Pastor Aramuwa corpse was found close to the area where he was abducted. Sources said he was abducted alongside his driver some days ago while returning home to Ifira, Akoko South East local government area. The sources said the kidnappers initially demanded for N10m but later collected N2m. But his lifeless body was later found by a search team. Asiwaju of Ifira Akoko, Chief Boboye Ojomo, who described the killing of Pastor Aramuwa as very tragic appealed to government agencies to rehabilitate the Orita-Ipele-Idoani-Ifira highway. Chief Ojomo said the deplorable state of the road was a major factor for incessant kidnapping and robberies in the area. He said the late Pastor has aged parents he used to cater for. His corpse has been deposited at a morgue in the area for possible autopsy. Ondo Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, who confirmed the killing of Pastor Ayamure, said investigation has commenced. He said Police operatives have been searching for him until his corpse was found.
