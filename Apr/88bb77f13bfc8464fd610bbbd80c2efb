Founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide (aka Winners’ Chapel) Bishop David Oyedepo has declared he would not take COVID-19 vaccine jab because he is not a guinea pig. The cleric expressed his disapproval for the vaccine during the church’s Covenant Hour of Prayer programme at Faith Tabernacle – Canaanland, Sango Otta, Ogun State on Saturday. Oyedepo said it was immoral to force people to take the vaccine. The Bishop said the church had the answer to some of the challenges facing the world, while he added that his job is to expose the devil and its agents. Oyedepo said he had never seen “a generation where people are forced to take vaccines. It is inhuman; it is immoral sir. I’m not a lawyer, but I do not think it is legal. You can’t come to my house and want to give me injections.” He added: “On what? Did I invite you? They are confused. But the church has the answer. Did you see any outbreak of virus here? How will it enter the gate? Will it come through the air? “How? One woman just got down after that injection in Kaduna. What kind of life? Are human beings now turned to guinea pigs? The world is confused but the church is lighted. “So the triumph of the church will humble the pride of the world. They don’t know what to do sir. In the last days, the church will be reigning in power and glory. That is God’s agenda. “No apologies. There is a big, big bird in our land, saying ‘don’t take it, they are deceivers’. Let me see someone who will come and inject me. By who? “Are you going to tie my hands? How? Did I invite you? I know you are quiet, you will hear more of it. My job is to expose the devil and tell his agents, ‘get off, we are not guinea pigs.”
