Bandits, who kidnapped the 39 students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka Kaduna, have released another video showing the remaining 29 students and other victims in their captivity. The bandits, who had demanded N500 million ransom from the government, later contacted the abdutees’ parents when Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s administration insisted it was not going to negotiate or pay ransom. Though no specific ransom was demanded for the students, the abductees, in the 4 minutes, 55 seconds video, begged their parents to pay so they can be freed. One of the students, a pregnant woman, identified by the bandits as “Hajiya,” pleaded with their parents to rescue them because of what they were passing through. She added they had been without food for the past 47 days with the bandits. According to her: “We are appealing to our parents to help us. We are tired and there is no food. “They should do their best to get us out of this place. We have spent 47 days, almost all of us are ill and there is no food. We sleep in the open even when it rains.” Another woman abducted by the bandits, said to be a wife of a Naval Officer, featured in the video. She said she was kidnapped from Agwa in Chikun Local Government Area of, stating her husband is a military officer based in Warri, Delta state. She pleaded with the Federal Government to come for their rescue, saying the bandits had earlier agreed on N30 million ransom for their release. It was however not clear whether she was referring to the remaining 29 Afaka students or others she was kidnapped with 11 days ago when she said, “they had agreed on N30million for our release.”
