  An Uyo-bound passenger on Ibom Airline George Etuk has commended the Aviation Security (AVSEC) personnel at the Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal two (MMA2) operated by Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited (BASL) after receiving his lost luggage containing N2,350,000 and other vital items. The incident, according to BASL AVSEC Manager  Olatubosun Okeowo, occurred while the passenger who just returned from the United States was at the terminal to link up with an Uyo-bound airline. “During our CCTV investigation,” Okeowo said, “it was discovered that the bag belonging to Mr. George Etuk was accidentally picked up by another intending passenger with the same airline. They were not aware at all. But after the flight was delayed, and the passengers had to relax ahead of the rescheduled time, the anomaly came to the fore.  “The other passenger who took the baggage unknowingly, too, had disappeared. On receiving the prompt message, our AVSEC Team immediately swung into action to unravel what went wrong. With the aid of the CCTV, we were able to identify what happened and my duty supervisor and his team quickly went after the man who picked the bag. “The man was intercepted at the Drop Off Zone area when he was about leaving for a nearby hotel to relax since the flight was rescheduled.” The bag was then retrieved and handed over to the owner who confirmed that the bag content (N2,350,000) was intact in the presence of the AVSEC duty supervisor with his team, the police and the Airline representative. Etuk expressed appreciation for a thorough job and the professional manner in which the investigation was carried out, saying “their quick intervention was commendable because it saved the day.”
