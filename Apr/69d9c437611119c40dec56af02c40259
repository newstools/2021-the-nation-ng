A global Non-Government Organisation (NGO) Mixta Africa and Junior Achievement Nigeria (a British Entrepreneurial programme) have announced plans to train 300 public secondary school girls in Lagos, Oyo, and Rivers states on basic financial literacy tools. Speaking Wednesday at the Junior Achievement Nigeria Virtual Stakeholders Engagement Session, Mixta Africa’s Chief Commercial Officer, Mrs. Rolake Akinkugbe-Filani, said beneficiaries would be taken through basic tools such as business planning, savings, investments and more. The Mixta chief said the training was conceived to give young people entrepreneurial skills and an opportunity to be in charge and plan their own destinies. Reeling worrisome statistics, Akinkugbe-Filani said an approximately 767 million girls worldwide had been forced out of school due to COVID-19 pandemic while 60 percent of Nigeria’s out of school children are girls. She said: “These girls as a result, are exposed to the risk of exploitation, a surge in child marriage and early pregnancy. These are the people Mixta Africa wanted to provide with sustainable support in partnership with Junior Achievement Nigeria BE-Entrepreneurial Programme.” She said Mixta Africa with its partner is stepping up its community engagement and would be setting a long term focus on girl empowerment. “Even if they don’t start a business, youth involved in entrepreneurship programmes gain skills and become more innovative and effective employees and managers,” she said. Speaking on the partnership, JAN’s Executive Secretary Foluso Gbadamosi, said the organisation had built a track record of success in delivering high-quality experiential hands-on programmes under the three pillars of financial literacy, work readiness, and entrepreneurship, to young people between five and 27.
