Ward executives of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ukana West II, Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State have passed a vote of confidence on President Muhammadu Buhari, Senator Godswill Akpabio and other leaders of the party. In a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, they said the decision to pass a vote of confidence on the party leaders at different levels, was to spur and encourage them to use their leadership positions to develop, direct and move Nigeria forward. The statement, which was signed by Hon. Elijah Umoren, the ward chairman, his Secretary, Ekemini Emmanuel Ukpeh, Youth leader, Daniel James, Legal Adviser, Edidiong Udofia and the women leader, Ruth Godwin Udom, maintained their decision was informed by the numerous laudable programs initiated by the administration since 2015. “The APC ward executive of Ukana West 2 in Essien Udim Local Government Area is delighted and happy with the appointment of their son and leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio into the Federal Executive Council, as Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, by our amiable President, Muhammadu Buhari, which has enabled him to continue to contribute his quota to the development of the Niger Delta and Nigeria. “We, therefore, reiterate our unalloyed support for President Buhari, as he strives to deliver dividends of democracy to Nigerians. “We also charge our son and leader, Senator Akpabio to continue to support the plans of Mr President for the region, because as a former governor of the state he showed the capacity and experience on how to get things done in the region. It was the President’s support and backing for our son that led to the historic commissioning of the abandoned NDDC headquarters in less than 2years in office.”
