The Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) has ordered its members across the country to commence an indefinite strike from April 6, 2021. This was contained in a statement by the Secretary-General of JUSUN, Comrade Isaiah Adetola. He explained the decision to embark on industrial action was referred back to the communiqué issued at the end of the last National Executive Council Meeting (NEC) of the union dated March 13 in Abuja. The union also noted the strike was billed to commence on April 5, 2021, but was postponed to April 6 due to a public holiday. The statement reads:” You are directed to shut down Courts/Departments in your states until further notice from the National Secretariat of JUSUN in Abuja”. JUSUN had issued the government 21- day ultimatum to commence implementation of financial autonomy of judiciary in line with the constitution and other extant laws.
