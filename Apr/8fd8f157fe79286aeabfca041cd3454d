I feel so happy, I love the way the club makes me feel, all the people who work here, my colleagues, the coach, the fans who I really miss in the stadium. “This really is like my home. If I can stay here for life, I gladly will.” Ibrahimovic also reserved words of praise for coach Stefano Pioli. “Working with Pioli is really easy, he has the right mentality.
