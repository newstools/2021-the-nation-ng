The outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has challenged the Federal Government to publish the names of those it claimed to be paying in the Southeast to drop the agitation for Biafra republic. It said failure to disclose the identities of the beneficiaries and evidence of such payments would be considered as one of the shameless lies that had become the trademark of the Federal Government. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, was quoted to have alleged that calls for secession had been used in the past to demand money from sitting presidents, but insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari would not succumb to such tactics. But IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, accused the Buhari administration of attempting to buy over its leader, Nnamdi Kanu. IPOB alleged that the Federal Government had tried to make Kanu abandon the Biafra agitation through “irresistible offers”, which were turned down by Kanu. The group asked the Presidency to first crush the bandits and terrorists overrunning the North before embarking on any military operation in the Southeast.
