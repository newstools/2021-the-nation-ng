  Two-time African champions Enyimba  yesterday recorded a 2-1 home win over  Entente Setif Sportive Club of Algeria on Matchday three of the Group A tie  in the CAF Confederation Cup played in Aba. The People’s Elephant needed a win to boost their qualification chances after their Matchday Two last-minute collapse against Orlando Pirates. The Algerians deservedly took the lead in the 13th  minute after Enyimba’s defence switched off to allow Monsef Bakrar to have an easy tap in off Akram Djahnit’s defense-splitting pass. Enyimba suddenly came alive after they went a goal down and they were rewarded with a penalty kick in the 17th minute after Dayo Ojo was hacked down in Entente Setif’s vital area. Skipper  Austin Oladapo stepped out to take the spot kick but the Algerian goalkeeper, Abdelouaheb Khedairia pushed  away  his shot. Enyimba never relented and it was  Oladapo that  scored the vital  equaliser  in the 40th  minute with a thumping finish off a fine assist from Dayo Ojo. At the restart,  Enyimba played with more urgency and fluidity and went ahead in the 60th with a touch of class and ingenuity from Super Eagles’ Anayo Iwuala. With the  home win, Enyimba moved to six points from three games and will hit Constantine for  the reverse  fixture against  Entente Setif  this weekend.
