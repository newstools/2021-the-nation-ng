A new range of affordable instant water heater has been introduced into the Nigerian market. Launched by Ariston Thermo Heating Technology Nigeria Limited, a member of the Ariston Thermo Group, the Ariston Aures delivers a smooth and fast hot water experience. The Group’s Central Africa Director Gaurav Bisaria said the new Aures range was borne out of a vision of delivering sustainable comfort.  He said the heater will meet the needs of homes that do not have the hot and cold pipes required for the installation of the storage water heaters. Bisaria said Aures, which is available in different power options (up to 36KW), comes with instant heating technology for unlimited hot water at a hyper-speed. “Aures is the fastest way to provide unlimited hot water whenever you need it, for comfort and good bathing experience. “One unique benefit of Aures electric instant water heaters is that the hot water is delivered instantaneously and maintains a constant temperature all through the duration of a bath,” he said.
