The Vice Chancellor of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo town, Oyo State, Prof. Timothy Abiodun Adebayo, has warned students of the institution against leaving the campus. He said considering reports of students abduction across the country, undergraduates should stay on campus. Adebayo, who expressed worry about rising cases of kidnapping, yesterday told the students that the “university has decided to monitor you; hence, there shouldn’t be unauthorised movement outside the campus.” Urging the students to be security conscious, the vice chancellor said: “With what is going on across the country, it appears nowhere is safe again. Therefore, all our students should stay on campus. No student should go outside the campus without permission.” According to him, “one of the advantages Ajayi Crowther University has is that we are fully residential. All of us are here on campus. I don’t want any student to go outside this campus without taking permission. You must also wear your identity cards always.”
