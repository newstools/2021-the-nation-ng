The Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Senator John James Akpanudoedehe has challenged religious leaders not to be silent when politicians go wrong. He also asked them not to succumb to blackmail but continue to hold public officials accountable at all times. The APC Secretary gave this charge on Tuesday at the 80th birthday thanksgiving and book launch of Venerable Emmanuel O. Ajayi (rtd) at Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Oboroke, Ihima Kogi State. Akpanudoedehe said: “Clerics should not be silent when politicians go wrong. They should continue holding the political class accountable to the people that we can have the kind of society we desire.” Represented by APC Assistant Director of Media, Edegbe Odemwingie, the APC scribe said: “Clerics should not be silent when politicians go wrong. For, it is by holding the political class accountable to the people that we can have the kind of society we desire. Religious leaders must be true examples to their followers. “Also, I want to appeal to Christians to continue to uphold the biblical injunction to pray for their leaders. Power comes from God alone and He gives it to whoever He wills. ‘As leaders, we do not know it all. We certainly require your prayers at all times for spiritual strength and divine wisdom to navigate the very complex art of governing a diverse nation like Nigeria.”
