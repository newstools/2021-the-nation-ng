Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is delighted to see Kelechi Iheanacho succeed with Leicester City. Guardiola worked with Kelechi at City before he left for Leicester. Ahead of their weekend clash, Guardiola said: “Incredible. The quality was there, he was a young player here and I believe at that moment with Gabriel (Jesus) and Sergio (Aguero) we didn’t have much space. “He is a fantastic person, we had a good relationship, and I’m delighted it’s going well lately “He’s playing for the injured (James) Maddison and he links really well with the midfield and he’s good in the behind, he’s fast and in the final third he has the right tempo, he is so clear in front of the goal.”
