Kid comedy star Emmanuella is currently making waves on YouTube following her debut feature in an international film, ‘Survive or Die.’ The 11-year-old humour merchant’s appearance in the film, which currently airs on YouTube, increased views on the feature film. Attesting to the popularity given to the film with Emmanuella’s feature, filmmaker Daniel Okoduwa expressed delight while admitting that the success of the movie on Youtube can’t be separated from Emmanuella’s inclusion. Okoduwa said, “1 million views in just a week! The inclusion of Emmanuella Samuel in this movie may be the driving force behind these high views in just a few days (based on the comments).” Co-written and directed by Daniel Okoduwa and Mike Kang, the film which was shot in Australia in 2018 features Emmanuella as a guest star alongside Hawa Barnes, Felino Dolloso, and Craig Bourke. The film has currently garnered over 1.5 million views and has gone on a two-year festival tour before its 2020 and 2021 release on Amazon Prime and YouTube respectively. Survive Or Die follows the story of Shade, a 16-year-old refugee whose escape from her war-torn African country lands her in a remote and uninhabited part of Australia. She must reach civilization whilst fighting for her life in the harsh terrain and from a hunter on a quest for revenge over the death of his son.
