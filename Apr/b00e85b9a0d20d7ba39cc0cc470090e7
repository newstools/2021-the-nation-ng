DMW music act, Tobechukwu Victor Okoh aka Perruzi has said it’s crazy for anyone to think he had sex with Davido’s fiancee, Chioma Rowland. Peruzzi, in a no holds barred chat with Chude Jideonwo on the latest episode of #WithChude, opened up on the rumour of his relationship with Chioma. “Someone said I had sex with the wife of the man who helped me. Do you know how crazy that is?” Peruzzi queried. The 31-year-old singer went further to say: “Even if you hate me, what did Davido do to you? So right now, I am careful of every pin that drops near me.” Perruzi admits to still getting shocked once in a while when absurd stories about him are shared on social media. He said the most absurd remains the false claim that he slept with Chioma. During the chat, Peruzzi also narrated how Innocent Idibia aka 2baba met him for the first time and bowed to him for his brilliance and ingenuity. “Gaaga called me one morning, [saying] that we should vibe in the studio and that 2Baba was going to be there as well, and I said okay. I had already planned everything I would tell 2Baba because I had not met him before that time. “When I got there, everything I planned on telling him was what he was telling me. He was bowing his head to me, and I was confused. I just kept saying, don’t do this to me; you are 2 Baba. What he did that day, I will never forget. We released the video, and it scattered Nigeria. Amaka gave me that older and more mature-minded audience. It was a song everyone could relate to, and it skyrocketed my career.” Peruzzi is one of the music acts on Davido owned DMW record label and remains popular for his collaboration with Gaaga and 2Baba entitled ‘Amaka.’
