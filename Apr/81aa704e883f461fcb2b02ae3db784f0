Intelligence gathering. 3. Channel for security alarm. 4. All the states taking responsibility for their respective security affairs. 5. Exchanging intelligence in a seamless manner. 6. Checkmating crimes in the zone. 7. To mitigate attacks on communities and prevent loss of lives and property. Meanwhile, the southeast leadership is yet to confirm if personnel of Ebube Agu would bear arms and wear uniforms. Abia Governor Okezie Ikpeazu explained: “Ebube Agu would be a security outfit both in name, purpose and action. It will be properly equipped. I want to assure you that all the states in the southeast already have various vigilante outfits.” Also, the five states in the region would enact a similar law to establish the outfit in its area of jurisdiction.
