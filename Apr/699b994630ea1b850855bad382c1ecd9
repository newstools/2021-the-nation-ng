Several Nigerian music acts and music producers have been rushing to register the recently launched Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria (MCSN), Gocreate App. MCSN’s Managing Director, Mayo Ayilaran, explained that the Collective Management Organization recorded a 30% increase in its membership base within three weeks of the launch of Gocreate App. Ayilaran noted that stakeholders agreed that MCSN has taken a golden step in the right direction by making the technology available to the right owners in Nigeria, especially to artists, producers, writers, and record labels, who are downloading the app in droves. “The Nigerian music industry is very vibrant and it’s no surprise that stakeholders have embraced this cutting edge innovation that allows right owners to register with MCSN by downloading the Gocreate App through the App Store or Google play store, and upload their catalogues for tracking and monitoring. The technology has also made the royalty payment process transparent and easier,” Ayilaran said. Ayilaran disclosed further that the Gocreate technology currently monitors over 1,000 radio and TV stations across Nigeria and Africa. “This innovative technology does not exist anywhere else in the world. So, the Nigerian music industry would soon become the envy of all creative industries across the globe,” he boasts.
