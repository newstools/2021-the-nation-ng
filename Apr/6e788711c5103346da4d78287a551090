American rapper Kodak Black has avoided jail time in his sexual assault case involving a teenage girl. According to reports, the 23-year-old rapper, born Bill Kapri, was sentenced to 18-month probation after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of first-degree assault and battery. Kodak was originally indicted on a charge of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree and faced up to 30 years in prison; however, the victim agreed to the terms of a plea deal that Kodak ultimately accepted. As part of the agreement, Kodak is required to get counseling as well as apologise to the girl who accused him of rape in 2016. The victim told authorities the assault took place inside a hotel room following Kodak’s performance in Florence, South Carolina. However, the victim did not immediately report her assault. Instead, she told her school nurse, who reported the attack to a school officer that relayed the account to law enforcement. The warrant for Kodak’s arrest stated he “forced the victim onto the bed in the room and then onto the floor of same before assaulting her, allegedly biting her on the neck and breasts, ignoring the victim’s pleas. Meanwhile, Black while in court apologized to the victim who watched the plea online. He said; “I apologise this happened, and I’m hopeful we can all move forward.”
