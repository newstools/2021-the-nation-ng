FAST-RISING Ghanaian music artiste, Jackie Acheampong aka Gyakie has listed three things a female artist should have at the front of their mind before going into the music industry. Gyakie, the daughter of Ghanian Highlife legend, Nana Acheampong, of the Lumba Brothers fame made this known on an Instagram live session recently. She said: “the first thing you need to be very confident in yourself if you do not believe in yourself you cannot even think of trying to do something. The second thing is you do not need to settle for anything less, if you have a talent it means you are unique and if you’re unique it means literally everybody will want you around them and so you don’t need to settle for anything less. And the last thing is, when you start something and you’re not getting the feedback that you expect you don’t need to give up, you need to keep going until you reach where you want to get to”. Gyakie’s hit song, Forever, was released in 2020 as one of the songs on the Ghanaian singer’s debut SEED Extended Play (EP). The song also charted on Shazam’s Top 200 and Billboard’s Top Triller Global and debuted on Uk’s official Afrobeat Chart top 20. The remix video of Gyakie’s Forever was shot recently by Dammy Twitch, and featured Headies award next rated winner; Omah Lay has surpassed 2.3 million views in less than two weeks.
