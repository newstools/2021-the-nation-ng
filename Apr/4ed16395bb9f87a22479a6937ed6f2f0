Data from the epidemiological report of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has shown that COVID-19 testing has dropped significantly in Taraba, Kogi and Adamawa states. According to the report, from March 29 to April 4 (Week 13), Taraba tested nobody; Kogi tested three persons; Adamawa tested 10. The report says: “In Week 13, the number of new confirmed cases decreased to 602 from 856 reported in Week 12. These were reported in 26 states and FCT. “In Week 13, the number of discharged cases decreased to 1,690 from 2,409 in Week 12. These were reported in 17 states and FCT. The number of reported deaths in the last one week in 2 states and FCT was 10. “Cumulatively, since the outbreak began in Week 9, 2020, there have been 2,058 deaths reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.3 per cent. “In Week 13, the number of in-bound international travellers at Nigerian airports was 19,005 compared with 15,687 in Week 12. “In Week 13, the number of international travellers with a positive result was 42 compared to 52 from week 12.” Speaking with reporters in Yola during a media dialogue organised by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Incident Manager of the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) of Adamawa, Dr John Stephens, said NCDC’s support for COVID-19 activities dropped. “It was left only in the hands of donors and people that cannot do much. Then, we had issues with testing because we had only one testing centre, and it is located in the Federal Medical Centre. “About 5,000 samples were pending in Jos because we had to move samples out and it took a week or two to get the results back.” “It is frustrating because here is a condition that we want to diagnose quickly and pounce on the contacts quickly, and trace these people quickly, but the result is coming after two weeks. “This is equivalent to a post-mortem. ‘He died already’. What can you do? So, it became useless and the figures just became data in paper or at the computer. “This affected us a lot. As I am speaking, things have improved a bit because in the report, they took almost 30 to 40 samples. These samples are for the past week and not for today. “We have over 500 samples pending right now and we are waiting for the results; these samples have been there for more than a week. “These samples are pending in Abuja and some in Jos because the machine here is overwhelmed.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) said 21 per cent of women have taken the vaccine, compared to 71 per cent for men in Adamawa.
