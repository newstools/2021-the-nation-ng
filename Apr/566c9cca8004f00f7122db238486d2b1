Singer and songwriter Tiwatope Savage, popularly known as Tiwa Savage has finally, though without words, debunked rumours making rounds on social media by showing off her stomach on her trip to Miami with her son. Recent Instagram post by the self-acclaimed Number 1 African bad girl debunks rumour claims that she is expecting a second child. A couple of weeks ago, there was news all over social media that Tiwa Savage was allegedly pregnant for one of Davido’s crew members, Obama DMW. A recent photo and video of the mum of one have debunked that rumour totally. Sharing photos on her Instagram page, the single mum wrote: “Taking MyArmy to Miami @officialjamilbalogun.” Reacting a fan wrote: “Tiwa I see what you did there, you are finally reacting by showing us your stomach to show that you are not pregnant like the blogs claimed.” Recall this rumour started after Tiwa’s Instagram live performance for the ‘Coming to America 2’ after party. The Instagram live showed vividly that she had added weight and displayed a bigger backside. At the time, Twitter went wild as different users shared their reactions on the claim.
