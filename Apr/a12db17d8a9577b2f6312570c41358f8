The Dunamis International Gospel Centre on Thursday inaugurated the construction of a road project initiated by the church, in Karu/Jikwoyi District in the Federal Capital Territory. Speaking at the inauguration, the District Pastor, Yakubu Usman, said that 550- metre road project, expected to be completed in the next few months, was the church’s social responsibility to help humanity. “The gospel is unto good works, we are the salt of the earth, a city set upon the hill cannot be hidden. “So, this work is not to prove a point but a social responsibility of the church to alleviate the suffering of the people and help humanity. “This is what the church is all about,” he said. Addressing the people, the Etsu of Jikwoyi, Bawa Jatta, commended the church for initiating the project, saying there was a need for the residents to support such a project as the government cannot do it alone. Jatta urged well-to-do Nigerians to emulate the church and come up with projects that would benefit the people. Resident Pastor of Dunamis Church, Kabayi, Samuel Edino, said: “We believe that this road, when completed is going to bring joy to this community and people around this place in many ways”. Joy Alakpa, a member of the church said that residents in that area usually find it difficult to access the road during the rainy due to muds. Bright Emeka, another resident in the community, said the project would change the face of the community when completed.
