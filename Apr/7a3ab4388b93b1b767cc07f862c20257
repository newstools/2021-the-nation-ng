The three quarry workers and a lady abducted at Idi Ayunre, along Ibadan-Ijebu-Ode Road in Oluyole Local Government Area of Oyo State, on Tuesday, have been rescued by the police. Ubong Jacob, Amisu Isaac, Wasiu and the lady, Adeoti Tosin, regained freedom on Friday around 6:20 pm. They were said to have been brought out of the bush by police operatives who had been on the kidnappers’ trail since they were abducted. It was gathered operatives, including the Divisional Police Officer of Idi Ayunre, the officer in charge of anti-kidnapping squad and local hunters along with vigilante members, had been combing the bush for three days before rescuing the victims. The kidnappers, it was learnt, abandoned the victims when they discovered the search team was closing in on them. Initially, only the three quarry workers were kidnapped. But it was later learnt the kidnappers added the fourth victim, Adeoti, when they saw her in a Uber car with the driver. Confirming the rescue, OYO Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) Adewale Osifeso, told The Nation: “Yes, I can confirm to you that they have been rescued unhurt.”
