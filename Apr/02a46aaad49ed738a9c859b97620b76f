Alex Iwobi has named James Rodriguez as the most skillful player at Everton but says the Colombian has surprised him since his summer arrival from Real Madrid. Iwobi has often been left on the bench at the expense of Rodriguez but has covered for him on the right-wing during some extended absences this season. Despite going head-to-head for a first-team spot it seems the Nigeria international holds his teammate in high esteem. Speaking to BBC MOTDx, Iwobi hailed the 29-year-old maestro but admitted he was taken aback at one trait he possesses when asked who was the ‘tekkers man’, or most skilful player, in the Blues squad. “I’m gonna give it [to] James because what shocked me was his right-foot finish, and I was like I didn’t know he had it in him,” he said. “Some of the passes he plays, I don’t know how he sees it, it’s not normal.” Injuries have robbed us of Rodriguez’s services for 10 Premier League games this season but in the other 19 he has certainly shown his substantial quality, in the most part. He possesses something different to most of our squad with his silky skills and elite-level vision which has seen him pick up four assists, though that’s a number he will surely be looking to improve upon further. Rodriguez has struck six times this season but remarkably 50 percent (three) have come via his right foot [Transfermarkt], with his latest effort coming on Easter Monday in the disappointing 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace at Goodison Park.
