Manaseh Ibokete of UNIUYO Tuskites yesterday recorded the first hat trick in the on-going 2021 Higher Institutions Football League (HiFL) as the Tuskites defeated the UNIZIK Cardinals by 5-0. In the game played at the UNIUYO Sports Complex, Ibokete proved to be a handful for the Cardinalâ€™s defenders who struggled to contain him throughout the match. Idari Jude provided the remaining two goals which shot the Tuskites to the top of the table in Zone E. In the third game, UNN Lions defeated the IAUE Minders by 3-2 while in Kano, Michael Samuel of Kogi State University recorded the second hat trick against the ATBU Bravehearts, as the team won 3-0. The score has put the qualification of ATBU for the next round into jeopardy having lost their two games and no longer fancied to qualify as the best loser from Zone A. The same scenario also played out in Lagos as LASU Blazers, who are the hosting university, are on the verge of exiting the competition. The Blazers lost their first game against UNILAG Marines by 1-0 and the second against LAUTECH by 2-1.
