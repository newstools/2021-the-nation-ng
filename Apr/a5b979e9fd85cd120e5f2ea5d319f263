The Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT) Foundation has donated food items to orphanages in Lagos and Ogun states. The materials, facilitated by the Speaker, Lagos House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, was handed out by the BAT Director General, Ahmed Omisore, Director of Media Mobolaji Sanusi and other members of the foundation. The donations were part of activities marking the 69th birthday of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Cartons of noodles, bags of rice and cartons of provisions and toiletries were given to the children at the orphanages. Omisore said the donation was to further demonstrate the love and kindness of Asiwaju Tinubu towards the less privileges, adding that it was an extension of his humanitarian largesse to the needy and the less privileged in the society. He promised that the foundation would attend to other needy people across the nation. Said he: “Recently, we delivered more than two trailers of rice to be shared by the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Borno State. We are sure it will reduce hunger among the IDPs. I am taking this opportunity to tell Nigerians that Asiwaju Tinubu has more for everybody in the country irrespective of their status.” Sanusi said the foundation has reached out to orphanages in Lagos and Ogun states, including Little Saints Orphanage at Abule-Egba, Lagos, SOS Children Village, Isolo, Lagos and Ijamido Children’s Home (Willoughby’s Home), Ota Ogun State. At the Ijamido Motherless Home, Dr. Sade Willoughby pledged support for Tinubu in his activities and ambition. She said the management of the orphanage would support his political ambition within its own capacity, saying she is praying to God to use him to bless the country.
