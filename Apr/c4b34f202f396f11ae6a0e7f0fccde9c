The Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, on Friday lamented that the police have a critical security situation in the Southeast and South-south geopolitical zones of the country that requires urgent attention. Baba said this at the opening of an emergency meeting with police strategic commanders in the Southeast and South-south geopolitical zones, following the security situation affecting the South-south and Southeast regions of the country. The IGP said the challenges would require the force to rejig its operational strategies to ensure that the issues are immediately nipped in the bud. According to him, “it is not like we do not have problems in other geopolitical zones of the country, but we have to address them one after the other.” He said calling a larger meeting of all Commissioners of Police (CP) and other senior officers would not be right at the moment because of COVID-19 protocols. Immediately after the meeting, IGP through a statement issued by the Force Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba, approved the posting of the Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Hafiz Inuwa as the Force Secretary and member of the Force Management Team. Baba also approved the re-appointment of CP Frank Mba and Ag. CP Idowu Owohunwa as the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO) and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) to the IGP respectively. The new Force Secretary, AIG Hafiz Inuwa, takes over from AIG Mustapha Dandaura who has been redeployed to Zone-7 Police Headquarters, Abuja. “In the same vein, the IGP has ordered the posting of the following officers; CSP Idris Abdullahi Abubakar as the PSO II to the IGP, SP Isah Abdulhamid as PA-IGP, SP Nura Kabir Hanga as Secretary – IGP, amongst other personal aides,” the statement said. Mba said the appointments and postings of the Senior Officers and personal aides take immediate effect.
