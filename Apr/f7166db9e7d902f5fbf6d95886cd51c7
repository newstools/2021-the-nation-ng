 One of Africa’s biggest women’s wrestling rivalries will come to fore at the Africa and Oceania Olympic Qualifier as Nigeria’s Aminat Adeniyi  square up against Marwa Amri  in the 62kg at the three-day tournament  in Hammamet, Tunisia. The Tunisian  road to a potential fourth Olympic Games will  be put to test  by the only  African wrestler to beat her, Nigeria’s Adeniyi. Since 2008, Amri has claimed several  gold medals at continental competitions with  just only two  defeats after  her loss at  the 2008 African finals as well as  losing to Adeniyi in the opening round at the 2015 African Games .  Meanwhile,  over 150 athletes from 22 countries will attempt to finish top two in their respective weight classes and qualify their nations for the Olympic Games. Nigeria’s quartet of Ebikewenimo Welson (57kg), Ogbonna Emmanuel John (74kg), Ekerekeme Agiomor (86kg) and Soso Tamarau (97kg) will compete for tickets in the men’s freestyle. Aside Adeniyi (62kg), other women that will be in action for Nigeria include Adijat Avorshai Idris (50kg), Bose Samuel (53kg) and Blessing Oborududu (68kg). Two Tokyo Olympic tickets will be up for grabs in each weight class as wrestlers must win their semifinal matches to earn an Olympic license for their respective National Olympic Committees.
