Parents of abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna have expressed shock bandits killed three of them despite ongoing negotiation. Three of the abducted students were found dead in a community close to the University on Friday morning. Abubakar Yusuf Sanga, the only male among the killed students, was buried in his home town in Sanga Local Government Area in accordance with Islamic rites. One of the traumatised parents said: “We are still in shock, we did not expect the bandits will resort to killing our children because they had contacted us since Wednesday and demanded for ransom. “They called us (the parents) directly and individually, but they demanded for a collective ransom of N800 million. “So, yesterday (Thursday) we (the parents) met at the school premises and we called them trying to negotiate the ransom, but they insisted on the N800 million. “Yes, we pleaded with them (bandits) that the amount they were asking for was too much and beyond our power but we never imagined or expected they were going to be so cruel that they will resort to killing our children.”
