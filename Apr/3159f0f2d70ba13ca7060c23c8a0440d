Not less than 50 communities in Niger State have been taken over by Boko Haram and bandits, Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello, has stated. He said Boko Haram has hoisted its flag in Kaure village of Shiroro local government area after taking over the community.
He spoke when he visited an emergency Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in IBB primary school in Minna. The Governor described the situation in Niger as critical and terrible.
“I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements around Kaure in Shiroro local government of Niger state. “They have taken over the territory. They have installed their flag. I am confirming to you that Boko Haram terrorists/ bandits have taken over some of the wives in the communities and attached them to the Boko Haram chiefs,” he said. The Governor called for urgent intervention from the Federal Government to prevent the Boko Haram terrorists from making Kaure their home and headquarters like they did to Sambisa forest. “I have been engaging the Federal Government and unfortunately it has gotten to this stage and if care is not taken even Abuja is not safe. We have been saying this for long and all efforts have been in vain,” he lamented. The emergency IDPs camp has 1447 children, 119 pregnant women and 447 other women. One of the youth leaders, who spoke during the Governor’s visit, Bulus Esu, said the terrorists have taken over Kuchi community in Munya local government. “For three weeks now there is no person living in Kuchi town and there is no food for the fleeing villagers. “The bandits have entered very deep into the area and have overrun several villages. They have occupied Kuchi where they now sleep as their homes,” he stated.
