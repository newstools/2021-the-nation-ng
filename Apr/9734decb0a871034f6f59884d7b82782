Police have launched an investigation into the killing of a herder Muhammed Maikudi allegedly by one Seyi Sansere, a hunter. Maikudi was killed in a forest reserve in Ifira Akoko in Akoko South East council area of the state. Muhammed, 24, was grazing his cows when he was shot. He was said to have hailed from Katsina State and was hired by one Alhaji Akerele from Kwara State to graze his cows. Police spokesman Tee-Leo Ikoro said investigation will unravel the involvement of other accomplices, if any. Sansere was said to have gone into hiding after killing the herder but was fished out and arrested. It was men of the Ondo Amotekun corps and policemen in the area that retrieved the body and deposited at a government hospital morgue in the council area. Leader of the Hausa Fulani community in the state, Bala Umar, said Sansere killed Muhammend without any provocation. Umar appealed to other herders to remain calm and not take the law into their hands.
