Legendary Welsh actor, Anthony Hopkins, last night made history at the Oscars 2021 Awards winning it at 83. He becomes the oldest winner of the award for his character in the movie, “The Father.” Anthony Hopkins won the award ahead of his fellow nominees Riz Ahmed “Sound of Metal”, Chadwick Boseman “Ma Rainey’ Black Bottom”, Gary Oldman “Mank”, and Steven Yeun “Minari”. Fans of the “Black Panther” Chadwick Boseman, have taken to social media to slam Anthony Hopkins winning ahead of Chadwick saying the “Ma Rainey Black Bottom” character played by Chadwick deserved to win the award while calling the Award organizers racist towards actors of colour. Presenter Joaquin Phoneix, who won the category last year for his performance in “Joker,” accepted the award on behalf of absent Hopkins. Anthony Hopkins won his first at the 64th Academy Awards, earning the “Best Actor” award for his iconic performance as an expert psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter in the 1992 psychological thriller, “The Silence of the Lambs.”
