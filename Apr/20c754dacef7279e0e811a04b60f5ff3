Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has vowed to unmask killers of Olufon of Ifon, Oba Adegoke Adeusi. Oba Adeusi was killed on November 16 by gunmen while returning from Akure. His killers are yet to be arrested five months after. Akeredolu, who spoke Saturday at an interdenominational in honour of late Adeusi, said he would leave no stone unturned at unravelling the killers no matter how long it will take. Akeredolu who spoke through Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Oladunni Odu, said he would continue to work with security agencies to ensure Oba Adeusi did not die in vain. He described the late Oluifon as a monarch who loved his people and attracted developmental projects to the community. Governor Akeredolu however cautioned the Ifon community to hasten the selection of a new king without hiccups. He urged them to abide by all chieftaincy declarations in the State in picking a new monarch. Oba Adeusi was crowned in 1997 and reigned for 23 years until he was killed last November.
