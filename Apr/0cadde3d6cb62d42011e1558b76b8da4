Former Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo is prepared  to join a potential collective boycott of social media if it helps end online abuse. The  former Nigeria international has expressed worries over the racist abuse online , threatening to boycott social media. He said: “If boycotting the social media is going to change things by bringing sanity and peace to football, I am going to do it 100 percent. We want things to chance in football as it cannot continue like this as we must take away racist abuse from the beautiful game.” Ighalo’s loan move to Manchester United from Chinese outfit Shanghai Shenhua in January 2020 is still considered as  one of the unlikeliest transfers of recent windows. Despite the move to Old Trafford being a brief one, leaving in January 2021 to join Saudi Arabian side Al-Shabab, it will be one the 31-year-old will never forget. In 23 appearances for United across all competitions, Ighalo scored five goals and described his experience at United as one of his best moments of his career. Ighalo said having played in six different countries, he is ready to take up any challenge in any country. “I’ve played in six or seven different countries now and I enjoy my football, so who knows the next destination! I’m not afraid to go to a new country, a new league, a new culture, and learn a new language. I’m ready for whatever opportunity,” he said. On life after football, he said: “I’d love to still be involved in football, maybe an agent or a coach but let’s see what happens.”
