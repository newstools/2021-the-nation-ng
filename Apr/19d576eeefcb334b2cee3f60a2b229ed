The mouthpiece of Northern Nigeria, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), has joined others to mourn the spokesman of Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin, who died in Lagos on Saturday. ACF said though, they often disagreed with Odumakin on many issues based on principles, they had hoped the Afenifere spokesman would live long enough to work for and see the new day. In a condolence message by its spokesman, Emmanuel Yawe, ACF prayed to God to condole the family of Odumakin and members of Afenifere. The group said: “While he was alive, Yinka held on to his views very strongly. We often disagreed with him on many issues. Our disagreements were however on principle and not personal. “We had hoped that Odumakin will live long enough to work for and see the new day. His death today has robbed us of that opportunity. We however pray for the CONDOLENCE of his family and his colleagues in AFENIFERE. We shall certainly miss him.”
