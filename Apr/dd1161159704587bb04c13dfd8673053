The coronavirus pandemic is a wake-up call for nations to collaborate effectively on science and technology for wealth creation, Minister of State for Science and Technology Mohammed Abdullahi has said. He spoke at a lecture he delivered to young entrepreneurs and company executives on Sunday in Lagos at the First Immaculate Heart Comprehensive High School. A statement issued in Abuja by Maryam Zakaria, Press Secretary to the Minister, stated that the lecture was entitled, “Technology, as a key driver to nation-building: Opportunities and collaborations”. The minister, in the lecture, said synergy among nations was necessary to forge public trust in the area of science and technology through knowledge-sharing. He urged developing countries to “prioritise Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) in their scheme of things“. “Today, countries are classified as developed and developed based on economic index and the application of STI,’’ he said. Abdullahi said countries that have strong science and technology were the ones that developed faster. According to him, innovation had also become a key driver of economic, industrial development and technology advancement of any nation. “The success of any nation is achieved through the effectiveness of the National Innovation System (NIS),” he said. Nigeria, the minister said, has adopted the STI Roadmap 2017-2030 which embraces nanotechnology, space technology, engineering, chemical technology, biotechnology, leather technology, among others. He said the strides the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology had made as a result of the National Leather Products Policy were helping to boost the country’s economy.
