President Muhammadu Buhari has described the elevation of Mr. Segun Ogunsanya as Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer of Airtel Africa Plc as another affirmation of Nigeria’s leadership in Africa’s continental matters. Ogunsanya was promoted from his position as MD/CEO of Airtel Networks Limited. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, Buhari said the new appointment has hoisted Nigeria’s flag across Africa once again. Congratulating Ogunsanya, the President said the appointment had once again proven that Nigeria has a surfeit of quality professionals, who can hold their own in any part of the continent, and even beyond. “President Buhari is sure that, with the cognate experience of the new MD/CEO for Africa, which spans consulting, banking, fast moving consumer goods, and telecommunications, he would acquit himself creditably in his new role, and repeat the strides that made him position Airtel Nigeria as the second largest telecommunications company by revenue, serving over 50 million customers. “He urges younger Nigerians to draw inspiration from Ogunsanya, saying with focus, dint of hard work, and resourcefulness, they would reach the peak of whatever careers they have chosen for themselves”, the statement said.. The new Chief Executive Officer, an Electronics Engineer and Chartered Accountant, will join the Board of Airtel Africa Plc from October 1, 2021. “The reward for hard work is more work,” President Buhari said as he wished Ogunsanya greater successes ahead.
