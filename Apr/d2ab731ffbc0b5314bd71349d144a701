Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State has said focusing attention on community policing, deployment of the use of technology and enhanced provision of funding and logistics for security agencies can quickly help address the upsurge of banditry attacks in the Northwest region The Kano State Governor, who made the observation while fielding questions from newsmen at the Government House Katsina, shortly after visiting Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State to console him over the recent Katsina fire incident, argued that community policing will provide the needed grassroots flavour and support in winning the fight against banditry in the region. While commending some  of his colleagues in the region who have adopted several security measures to checkmate banditry in their states, he advised those yet to do so to brace up to community policing and the introduction of the use of technology. Governor Masari thanked Ganduje and his entourage for the visit, adding that there are no major differences existing between the two states. He said, “We share our longest borders, and the relationship between us has remained ages. I don’t see boundaries and differences but administrative conveniences.”
