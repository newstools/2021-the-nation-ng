The international Mrs. World Inc. Organisation, says it has accepted the resignation of 2020 Mrs. World, Caroline Jurie, a Sri Lankan national after she decided to hand over her crown. The organisation, in a statement on Wednesday, said that following Jurieâ€™s resignation, Kate Schneider, the first runner-up at the international pageant and Mrs Ireland World, will take over as the new Mrs. World 2020. Jurie was crowned the Mrs World 2020 in 2019 and was to hold the international crown till December this year. But she decided to hand over her crown after she forcibly uncrowned the Mrs. Sri Lanka 2021 winner in a pageant held in Colombo in early April. The former beauty pageant claimed the winner, Pushpika De Silva, was a divorcee and therefore was ineligible to contest in the Mrs. World 2021 international pageant to be held in December. Jurie was, however, arrested by the police after a complaint was lodged by the pageant winner, De Silva and released on bail. (Xinhua/NAN)
