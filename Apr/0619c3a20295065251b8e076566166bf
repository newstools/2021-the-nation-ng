By Ekaete Bassey Ex-BBNaija “Pepper Dem” Housemate and social media personality Anita Natacha Akide, popularly known as Tacha, has been trolled by social media users for offering advice which they have interpreted as unsolicited. The controversial media personality took to her Instagram page to advise young ladies on the needs not to feel pressured or underachieving because of people she termed “sugar daddy babes.” She added they should keep at what they are doing and ensure they achieve their goals dismissing any form of distraction or discouragement from those who look up to older men to meet their needs. The quote reads: “Good morning QUEENS. Don’t allow this sugar daddy babes make you feel like you are not doing enough dust your crown, get up and go build that Empire because you can.” However, Tacha has since come under fire from social media users for her post. They have opined that she is not in any way the best person to give such an advice especially from the angle where she’s hitting from. According to them, she falls into the category of ladies she’s advising against. blandrosey wrote: “Are you not one of the sugar baby.” chidinmaochonga wrote: “I think say Na sugar daddy u Dey carry before.. u don retire?” stephz.hairempire wrote: “Nne don’t break your leg on this table you’re trying to shake biko.” aticu_sinberg wrote: “Aunty rest abeg!
