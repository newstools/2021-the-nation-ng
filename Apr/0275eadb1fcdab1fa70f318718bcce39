Music star, Davido has secured a new endorsement deal with a laundry soap brand, Viva. Davido hinted to his over 19.9 million followers on Instagram about his new endorsement deal on Thursday, April 22. The manufacturing company behind the laundry soap, Aspira Nigeria Limited, recently unveiled Davido as its brand ambassador at a recent event on Victoria Island. The endorsement adds to the many endorsement deals in the father of three’s kitty. His other endorsements include Infinix, Travelbeta, Glo, and Pepsi. Speaking at the unveiling, Davido noted that he was happy to join the Aspira family to further promote its flagship brand, Viva.  The music star further said he would share the good news of the brand with his fans and followers and look forward to enjoying his relationship with the company. “I represent a lot of international brands and I wouldn’t have been here it the product was not top notch. We live in a society where we need to be clean and hygenic and the brand supports this.” Davido and his partner, Chioma Rowland had signed an endorsement deal with Mario & Juliet Diapers, months before welcoming their son, David Ifeanyi Adeleke. Aspira Nigeria Limited had earlier in the year unveiled their products that include Viva Plus Laundry Sanitizer Detergent Powder. The Head of Marketing, Aspira Nigeria Limited, Santhosh Kumar Nair, said the company was happy to welcome Davido to his fold and believes the relationship will be beneficial to both parties. “Davido has contributed immensely to the music industry. There’s a symmetry between Aspira and Davido’s core values and this informed our decision to make him our ambassador.”
