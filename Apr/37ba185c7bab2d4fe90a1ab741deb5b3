Villarreal CF manager Unai Emery has tasked Samuel Chukwueze to score more goals after the Super Eagles fired a brace against UD Levante. On Sunday night, Chukwueze scored a brace to help Villarreal defeated hosts Levante 5-1 in a La Liga clash. The 21-year-old player has now scored three goals in 25 league games this season. He has only matched the tally he achieved last season. He netted five times in his debut La Liga season. “He’s a very young player who has to find consistency,” Emery told the Villarreal website. “We need to take steps forward with him and be demanding. He’s a footballer with great quality. He has a lot of talent, but he needs to improve in front of goal. “Today (Sunday night) he put in a great performance and managed to score.”
