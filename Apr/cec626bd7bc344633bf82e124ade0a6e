The Forum of State Chairmen of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has refuted the alleged plot by it to reject tenure elongation for the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). Rather, the forum said that it’s Wednesday meeting only deliberated on the need to extend the membership registration, revalidation and update exercise, a request that has since been approved with a 3-week extension of the exercise. Reacting to the news making the rounds that the forum rejected a plot to extend the tenure of the Caretaker Committee, the Chairman of the Forum and Chairman of Borno State Caretaker Committee, Hon. Ali Buka Dalori, in Abuja yesterday said at no time was anything related to tenure elongation of CECPC deliberated on or mentioned during their meeting. According to Dalori, “A news report of how the recent meeting of states caretaker chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) rejected an imagined plot to extend the tenure of the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) is fake and only exist in the imaginations of the authors and their sponsors. “Our meeting deliberated on and unanimously agreed on the need for an extension of the ongoing membership registration, revalidation and update exercise and we are happy the CECPC promptly acceded to our pleas by granting a three-week extension to accommodate states requiring additional time to conclude the exercise and capture millions of Nigerians who are still desirous of joining the APC. “At no time during the meeting of APC states caretaker chairmen or in our briefing to media organisations after the meeting was anything related to tenure elongation deliberated on or mentioned. “The CECPC under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni has truly surpassed its mandate to reposition and bring unity to the APC and we will continue to support all its efforts to ensure the completion of all the tasks assigned to the CECPC by the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) and further entrench the APC as a truly progressive political platform.”
