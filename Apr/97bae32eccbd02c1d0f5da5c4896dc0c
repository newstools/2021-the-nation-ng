Fuji star, Wasiu Alabi Ajibola aka Pasuma has recounted how an impersonator had swindled his fans of a whopping sum of N13 million. Pasuma narrated how an individual had impersonated him using a Facebook account to extort money from his fans. The 53-year-old singer who just returned from Cairo made the revelation in an Instagram live interview. Pasuma said he was invited by the police over the incident and when he got to the police station they showed him a fraudster who had been impersonating him on Facebook and had collected over N13 million from his fans. He said “I saw someone in America that told me that on a good day I’m supposed to greet him for what he sent to me and asked that didn’t I see what he sent to me? The person saw me in New Jersey and refused to greet me and I told him it wasn’t me and he said he had the number he used to communicate with me and I said he should call it and let me see and behold he called the number and even had a conversation with the person right in my presence and I told him that, have you seen now that it wasn’t me that you have been speaking to all this while?”. The popular singer used the opportunity to plead with his fans around the world who fell victims not to relate or negotiate with any Pasuma account on Facebook. Oganla one, as he is fondly called, further noted that although he has a large number of fans, he hopes that the unpleasant incident would not repeat itself. He however urged his fans to reach out to him preferably through his verified Instagram account ‘Officialpasuma’.
