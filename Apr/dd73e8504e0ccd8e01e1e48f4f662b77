 Nollywood actress and producer, Biola Adebayo has taken some time to reflect on her humble beginnings with a throwback picture. The ‘Eyin Oka’ star took to her Instagram page to share a throwback picture of when she hawked bread on the streets of Lagos years back. Although not an old picture, the actress said the picture reminds her of her journey as a young adult while seeking admission into a higher institution and how she hawked to make ends meet. “This picture reminded me of my humble beginning. I hawked different things on the street but was more popular with bread because that was the last thing I hawked as a young adult seeking admission into University. It was a tough one, I know a few people can attest to that here,” she captioned a photo of herself hawking bread.  Continuing, Adebayo disclosed how she forfeited university admissions four times due to lack of finance. “I lost 4 different admissions because I couldn’t afford to pay, it took me about 7 years to finally get into university but today, I’m not just a graduate but a master’s degree holder. It wasn’t easy but in all, I never stop loving God and hoping, and for truth, God has been very good to me. I am not there yet but I am definitely not where I used to be. The reason for my epistle is to encourage someone, please don’t give up on your dreams, no matter what life throws at you, you’re going through those challenges for a purpose, just keep praying, put God first, be diligent, keep working harder, get better at whatever you do daily and stay focus. Your light will soon shine.”
