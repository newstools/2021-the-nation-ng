Efe Apochi only needed just over three rounds to knock out previously unbeaten Deon Nicholson and win the  World Boxing Association (WBA) Cruiserweight title eliminator at Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall in Los Angeles, scoring two knockdowns during the fight. With the victory, Apochi has positioned himself as the mandatory challenger for WBA titleholder Arsen Goulamirian (26-0, 18 KOs) of France and the 2014 Commonwealth Games bronze medalist is calling for the title shot. “This is an eliminator, where is the title?” Apochi asked after the fight. “Bring it on, I want the strap.” Apochi, who moves to a perfect 11-0 with eleven knockouts, believes he can only get better as he continues to fight, adding that his confidence in the ring has always been there before he started boxing. “I was a street fighter before I became a boxer, all my life has been fighting,” Apochi said “The confidence is just there, it is inbuilt, I hear people saying ‘he is building his confidence’ and I say no! I was a born fighter and the confidence has been there all my life. I just get better with every fight.” “I see the transformation from my first fight and I know I can only get better,” He added.
