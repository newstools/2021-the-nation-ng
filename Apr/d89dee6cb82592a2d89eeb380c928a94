Benue Police Command said it has recovered eight bodies from the scene of the tanker fire incident in Oshigbudu in Agatu Local Government Area of Benue State. The statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of Benue Command Kate Aneene, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) indicated that 16 houses including properties were razed as a result of the fire incident. The tanker was said to be conveying diesel from Otukpo to Abuja, through Oweto-Abuja Road. DSP Aneene said one of the occupants of the tanker who survived the fire incident has been taken to the General Hospital Otukpo where he is receiving treatment. In a related development, the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Mr Yakubu Mohammad has warned all petroleum tanker owners against the non-use of “safety valves” to guard against spillage of petroleum products, when involved in a crash. Mohammad called on all petroleum tanker owners to ensure the immediate installation of safety valves on their tankers to ensure the safety of lives, properties and the products they are transporting. He said: “The tanker lost its control, spilt fuel and burst in flames. Henceforth, any driver caught disobeying the road regulations will risk going to jail,” Mohammad warned. According to him, it is disheartening to see petroleum tankers still plying the roads without safety valves fixed on them despite the February 2021 deadline earlier issued. He assured members of the public that FRSC would ensure strict enforcement of road regulations and discipline. Mohammad also advised tanker drivers to avoid giving their vehicles to their ‘motor boys’ to drive on the highways. The sector commander, who sympathised with the people of Oshigbudu on the incident, prayed for the souls of the departed and wished the families of the deceased fortitude to bear the loss.
