Senior Pastor of Abuja-based Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Dr Paul Enenche, has dismissed reports in some quarters that his church recently acquired a private jet as “absolutely false and totally untrue”. The cleric said though his ministry could afford to acquire a private jet for the “purpose of easy, stress-less and aggressive spread of the gospel”, the church was yet to buy one. Enenche reacted in a statement on Friday through his Secretary, Sylvester Edoh titled: ‘On the purported acquisition of a Private Jet’. The statement reads: “By God’s grace, we do not lack the capacity to acquire or own a private jet for the sake of the gospel. “However, the news of our acquisition of a private jet that is currently making rounds is absolutely false and totally untrue. “The picture of the jet making rounds is that of an aircraft, N838BB HAWKER 800XP (HS25), belonging to a private aviation company that was chartered in December 2019 for a series of crusades in Benue State,” the cleric said. “We do not need to acquire or buy an equipment before we can own it. “We have the capacity to announce by ourselves, whatever we deem news-worthy.”
