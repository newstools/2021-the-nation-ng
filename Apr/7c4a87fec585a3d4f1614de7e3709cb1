The three policemen allegedly involved in the forceful extortion of N153,000 from one Sheriff Adedigba have been dismissed from service. The dismissed policemen are: Inspector Sunday John, Sgt Jimoh Asimiya and Sgt Solomon Adedapo. They were alleged to have forcefully extorted the amount from the victim while he was traveling from Abeokuta to Lagos. Having heard about the incident on social media, the commissioner of police Edward Ajogun ordered the immediate arrest and detention of the officers involved in the dastardly act. Police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the three policemen were quickly identified and apprehended while the money was also recovered from them and returned to the victim. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent of Police(DSP), said the three were subsequently arraigned for departmental orderly room trial and found guilty on all three-count charges of Corrupt practices, Discreditable conduct and Disobedience to a lawful order. According to the spokesman, they were subsequently dismissed from the force to serve as deterrence to others threading similar paths. The victim, he noted, was also present to give evidence and was full of praise for the Commissioner of Police and the management team for their prompt response to the incident, which he said rekindled his hope in the Nigeria Police Force.
