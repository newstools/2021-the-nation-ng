Traditionally, consumers buy beverages with a main focus on their taste, price, and convenience. However, as consumption knowledge advances, consumers are paying more attention to the beneficial health value of their Ready-to-Drink beverages, particularly as it concerns the use of all-natural ingredients, nutritional value and artificial sweeteners. In this vein, more consumers have started to turn to beverage options like Ice Tea to stay hydrated and provide valuable vitamins required by the body. A cross section of consumers interviewed have expressed their preference for Chivita ice tea, noting that they were attracted by its unique intrinsic benefits of all-natural ingredients such as the source of Vitamin C, and its superior taste. Chikodi Okonkwo, a nurse, said that after a sweltering hot day, her beverage preference for hydration and rejuvenation is Chivita Ice Tea. Rasheed Olukoya, a civil servant, stated, “Ice tea consumers like myself are becoming more savvy and adventurous, putting a premium on quality and health consideration in addition to great taste. Chivita Ice Tea fits the bill when I need a quick boost. It is a perfectly healthy choice with natural taste.”
