Hundreds of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the Northeast have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Service Chiefs to intensify the fight against terror in the region so that they can return to their homes. The IDPs, under the aegis of the Conference of Northeast IDPs (CNIDPs), expressed displeasure with the current state of insecurity in the country, recalling that they had thought the appointments of new Service Chiefs would make a difference. In the statement signed by Alhaji Umar Shafa for Borno State; Chief Bitrus Waja representing Adamawa State and Mallam Mohammed Buni for Yobe State, the IDPs pleaded with President Buhari to expedite action against insecurity so that total peace could be restored in the region. According to them, Boko Haram threats have assumed a new dimension with a direct target on farming communities and markets. The statement said: “This is a deliberate act to weaken the economy of the Northeast. Farmers are killed and their farms and livestock destroyed or stolen every day. “It is with heavy hearts that we make this press statement to express our frustration with the current security situation in the Northeast, particularly the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) whose plights are not only getting more frustrated but also out of hand on a daily basis. “The hope of getting back to our communities is dimming every day without any sign of it getting better. “The Boko Haram threats have assumed a new dimension with a direct target on farming communities and markets. This is a deliberate act to weaken the economy of the Northeast.
