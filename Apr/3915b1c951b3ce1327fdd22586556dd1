 All is set for the president of the Association of Movie Producers (AMP) Peace Anyiam Osigwe to host a Master Class for film producers in Delta State. Anyiam Osigwe will be imparting her knowledge to the next generation of Nigerian filmmakers in one of the activities billed for the forthcoming Delta State Film Weekender. The film event is being put together by the Delta State arm of the Association of Movie Producers and is scheduled to be held between May 19 and May 22, 2021, in Asaba, Delta State.  In a chat, the stateâ€™s AMP chairperson, Chidi Chijioke, says he convinced Anyiam-Osigwe to take the class because it was imperative that she impart her knowledge and wealth of experience. Other activities lined up for the event include a master class in cinematography by John Aduloju, the president of the Cinematographer Society of Nigeria, introduction to cinematography anchored by members of the society, documentary filmmaking workshop, script for beginners and screenings of movies, and a Gala Night to celebrate filmmakers in Asaba. Chijioke also harped on the need for capacity building to improve the quality of productions since Delta State hosts about 400 film sets every month.
