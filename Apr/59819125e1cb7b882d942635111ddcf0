 Eddie Hearn has confirmed that Anthony Joshua has now officially started his training camp for the Tyson Fury fight. It is known that the pair have signed contracts to meet, but a site deal still must be completed to determine the date/venue before the fight is finalised. When giving an update on this, Hearn let slip that AJ’s preparations are now fully underway. It was known that he’d been ticking over at his old amateur club Finchley ABC since the Kubrat Pulev win, but his training camp has now properly begun. He will soon head up to the EIS in Sheffield and link up with head trainer Rob McCracken.  Hearn told reporters: “We can’t wait. AJ has started his training camp and Fury has been training very hard. They all want the fight. “They are going to be presented with a few proposals on where to do the fight and everyone has to agree on where to do it. “There is no other fight out there that comes close for either guy. July is the date… “Really I think end of next week it will be done. “Talks have progressed extremely well and we’re closing in on securing the venue and there will be an announcement in due course. “We’re at the stage where it’s probably best not to say much more than that.”
