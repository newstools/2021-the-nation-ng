The General Overseer of Resurrection Praise Ministry, Archbishop Samson Benjamin protested against the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday in Lagos. Benjamin, popularly known as Jehovah Sharp Sharp, carried a coffin as he marched through the streets of Festac. The Bishop claimed God asked him to do so because He wasn’t happy with the government and the state of the nation. The cleric explained that his action was the outcome of “a spiritual journey of more than one year”. “From the 15th of September 2019 up until this moment, I have not eaten food cooked by fire or any pleasant food, I have been seeking the face of God over this great country. “Last week, I had a mortal vacation, which was a solitary confinement where I didn’t talk to any human to be with the cabinet of the trinity, I didn’t see the sun, moon, clouds.’ “What you are seeing me do here right now is what the Prophets of Old would do. God will ask them to carry a symbol when he wants to pass a message to the leaders of the nation. “He said to me ‘Go and carry a coffin on your head, it is not furniture or anything for interior decoration, it is good for nothing, it is at the end of the life of a man that he is put into a coffin.” He claimed God told him: “Tell the leaders that they have intentionally depleted the common resources that belong to this great country and have brought hardship on the citizens, I am not happy with it.” On why he didn’t take it to the Aso Villa, the seat of power in Abuja, Benjamin said God had not asked him to do that yet. “Secession cry is everywhere, the question is is it God’s will that all these must happen? We need to sit down at a round table and look at it again what and what put us together, whether those things are still workable today or are no longer workable,” Benjamin said.
