  Samuel Chukwueze scored his fourth goal of the season for Villarreal but it was not enough to salvage a point against Barcelona whose brace from Antoine Griezmann earned valuable three points at Estadio de la Ceramica. Chukwueze opened the scores in the 26th minute but Barca replied swiftly through Frenchman, Antoine Griezmann who equalised in the 28th minute and the same player put the Blaugrana ahead in the 35th  minute. Villarreal threw everything at Barcelona with the zeal to get the equalising goal but the Lionel Messi-inspired side defended stoutly to go level on point with Real Madrid on 71 points with a game lesser than Zinedine Zidane. They are third based on Madrid’s better head-to-head result despite having superior goals difference. Chukwueze who has now scored three goals in the last three games for the Yellow Submarines was on the pitch for 89 minutes before he was replaced for his 27th league game of the season. He has four goals in total in the La Liga this campaign.
