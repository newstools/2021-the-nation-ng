The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has said it will map out communities prone to floods and other disasters ahead of the rainy season. The agency explained that its action would help it to avert the likely impacts of floods and other disasters across the country. The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) had said flood killed over 400 people died in 2020 across 20 states of the federation. NEMA Director General, AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (retd.), said the impact of flooding and other disasters, which cause deaths, displacement and loss of properties could be reduced, if states work with the agency. Muhammed spoke yesterday in Abuja at the Experts’ Technical Meeting of Stakeholders to analyse the 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions. He said: “This gathering has become more relevant, considering our past experiences of unprecedented flood and other disasters that had affected several states of Nigeria and wreaked havoc on communities and drastically affected our collective disaster resilience.”
