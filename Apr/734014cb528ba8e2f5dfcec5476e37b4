Arsenal are reportedly in the transfer battle to sign Eduardo Camavinga after he refused to sign a new contract at Rennes. But the Gunners face strong competition from Manchester United and Real Madrid for the defensive midfielder. Reports earlier this week stated the 18-year-old would not put pen to paper on a new deal with the Ligue 1 side. With his current contract expiring in 2022, that means Rennes may be forced into selling their young star or risk losing him for free next year. And according to Marca, Arsenal may try their luck to lure the Frenchman to the Emirates – even if, like Rennes, they cannot offer Champions League football next season.  A lack of European football of any kind at Rennes plus suggestions they would try and add a release clause into a new contract is thought to be putting Camavinga off committing his future to the club and pricing himself out of a dream move. He signed with Gareth Bale’s agent Jonathan Barnett at the end of last year, possibly in anticipation of a mega move. And with plenty of links in England and Spain, there will be no shortage of interest in the Frenchman. Barnett told The Athletic: “Camavinga can play next year in the Premier League. He is that good. Whether he will or not, I don’t know. “His background is tough if you know what he went through as a refugee. But his character is amazingly strong.
