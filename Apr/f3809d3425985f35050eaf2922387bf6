DMW music act, Tobechukwu Victor Okoh aka Perruzi has confessed to not having a lover or girlfriend. In a recent radio interview, Peruzzi said, “I don’t have a girlfriend at the moment.” The singer, however, admits to seeing a lot of ladies but does not have a girlfriend. Peruzzi, who is currently promoting his sophomore album, ‘Rum & Boogie,’ had cleared the air on his rumoured affair with Davido’s fiancee, Chioma Rowland, saying it’s crazy for anyone to think he had sex with her. Peruzzi, in a no holds barred chat with Chude Jideonwo on #WithChude, opened up saying, “Someone said I had sex with the wife of the man who helped me. Do you know how crazy that is?” The 31-year-old singer went further to say, “Even if you hate me, what did Davido do to you? So right now, I am careful of every pin that drops near me.” Perruzi admits to still getting shocked once in a while when absurd stories about him are shared on social media. He said the most absurd remains the false claim that he slept with Chioma.
