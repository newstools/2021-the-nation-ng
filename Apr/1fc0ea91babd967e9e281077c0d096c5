The Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to Imo Governor Hope Uzodimma on Gender Vulnerable Groups Northern Affairs, Sulaiman Ibrahim Sulaiman, has dismissed rumour that northerners are leaving the State over insecurity. He described the publication in a national newspaper (not The Nation) as completely false. Sulaiman told newsmen in Owerri the rumour was a calculated attempt to cause panic in the state. He said that northerners in Imo are at peace with their host communities irrespective of security challenges facing the state, adding that “there is no plan for any Northerner to leave Imo State now.” He said: “The state government is committed towards ensuring the protection of lives and properties of the citizenry especially the northerners in the state.” He described Northerners in the state as law abiding people, adding they would do everything humanly possible to support government and promote peace in the state. “I call on all Hausa community and the people of the state to disregard the information which lacks basic truth and is targeted at causing disaffection between Hausa and their hosts. He also advised the Hausa to go about their daily duties and businesses in the state without fear as no harm would befall them.
