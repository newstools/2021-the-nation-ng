The persons have been reported dead in a renewed cult clash in Edo State. The Nation learnt the first victim of the cult war was Ogbomo, who was killed by a four-man gang around 4 pm along Esigie Street, 3rd Circular Road, Benin. Angered by his killing, a rival cult group mobilised their members, which led to the killing of a commercial bus driver along 3rd Circular Road, by Esigie Junction. The bus driver was shot dead at close range in a commando style, as the cultists’ Audi car suddenly overtook the commercial bus, thereby forcing the driver to stop. The gunmen then alighted and dragged the bus’ driver out, shooting him until he died on the spot without any challenge from passersby. Edo Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) Bello Kontongs, a Superintendent of Police (SP), said the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of the area had not briefed the Commissioner of Police, Phillip Ogbadu.
