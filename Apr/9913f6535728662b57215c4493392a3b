The Chairman, House Committee on Science Research Institutes and the member representing Ibadan North Federal Constituency, Mr. Musiliu Akinremi, has said giving motorcycles, clippers, grinding machines and other items as a form of empowerment is not the best way to empower constituents. He spoke in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, while addressing reporters after a town hall meeting with his constituents and graduation of over 250 constituents, who were trained in vocational fields. The All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmaker said politicians should find ways to assist their constituents, to rid the country of poverty. He said the best way to allow them feel the impact of their representatives is to equip them with vocational training, which will make them to become financially independent. “Since I became Ibadan North Federal Constituency legislator in 2019, I have purchased the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) forms for 1, 045 students. Training people in how to make money is one of the best ways I am talking about. “Our training centre for women and young ladies in Ibadan North Federal Constituency will soon be ready for inauguration,” Akinremi said.
