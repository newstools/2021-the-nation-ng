The Lagos Police Command on Wednesday arraigned 60 suspected cultists before a Yaba Chief Magistrate’s Court. The suspects, arrested at different locations, were arraigned on 13 counts of conspiracy, murder, cultism, unlawful possession of firearms and breach of public peace under the Lagos State State Anti-Cultism Law, 2021, and the Criminal Laws of Lagos, 2015. According to the new anti-cultism law, convicted cultists risk 21 years in prison while their parents could be fined N500,000. A statement by police spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said the Commissioner (CP) Hakeem Odumosu, was confident the new law would contain the menace of cultism as it addresses many loopholes that were in the previous law. He said, “The Commissioner of Police had coordinated some raids and operations around the state, especially, in Ikorodu Division to go after cultists and hoodlums and bring them to book. “The police boss confirmed that the new law is a blessing and catalyst to eradicating cultism across the length and breadth of the state as the law caters for many loopholes in the previous laws pertaining to cult related matters.” “He further appreciated the Govenrment and good people of Lagos State for making the law a reality and success which is now applicable in the state. “CP Hakeem Odumosu therefore charged the Divisional Police Officers and other operational units to be on their toes and make sure the state is rid of cultism and other social vices, as the command enjoys the enabling mechanism to operate and discharge its duties as expected.”
