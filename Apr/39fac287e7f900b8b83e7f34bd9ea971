 Nollywood actress, Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi has weighed in on bad friends saying that everyone is guilty of bad friendship. The actress and mother of one said that while people complain of horrible experiences from their friends and try to distance themselves, they have also in a way been bad to somebody else. She advised that rather than avoiding the so-called bad friends, friends should hold one another with grace and compassion. “You complain that friends are bad and so you don’t want to have friends. I complain that friends are bad and so, I’d rather do without them. But honestly, who are these bad friends that make us all want to do away with friendships if not us all? Truth be told, most of the time, we are the bad friends we all complain about,” she began.  “All of us are guilty in one way or another. We’ve been bad friends to somebody at one point or the other. So, if we avoid, cancel or run away from everyone who has offended us at one point or the other, what do we do with ourselves? “I think it is easier to point out other people’s flaws than it is to accept that we are all flawed humans in some way. And so, when we expect perfection from one another, we ruin the beauty of friendships. Because look, we all have our good and bad sides and it is never realistic to think that we can experience people without their flaws. ? “So, rather than avoiding one another, rubbishing one another, exposing our weaknesses and publicising our offences, hoping it would create the balance and stability we desire in our friendships and shield us from being hurt by “people”, let us hold one another with grace and compassion instead. It is only then that it becomes possible to lovingly hold one another accountable and help each other grow into our best selves!”
