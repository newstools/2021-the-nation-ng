  Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps ( NSCDC),  Lagos Command yesterday smashed a syndicate behind petroleum pipeline vandalisation at Baruwa community in Alimosho Local Government Area  of Lagos State. Two members of the syndicate  were arrested with a 60,000-litre truck loaded with petrol. It was learnt that the suspects were apprehended after they were overpowered when they attacked the NSCD operatives. Lagos State Commandant of NSCDC, Mr. Paul Ayeni, said the command received a distress call at about 1:00 am yesterday. According to Ayeni, his men responded swiftly before the suspects could escape. The suspects, according to Ayeni are: “Francis Ogbechie, 31, of No 3 Bless-Jar, Gowon Estate, Egbeda, Lagos State and a native of Isele-uku, Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. “The second suspect is Pius Uchenna, 32, who lives at No. 3, Bori Street, Cele Village, Egbeda, Lagos State, a native of Agbor, Ika South LGA of Delta,” he said. The NSCDC boss explained further that the suspects drove four trucks into the creek with the aim of siphoning petrol. ”However, on citing our men, about 40 bunkerers jumped out of the creek and pounced on our men. “The NSCDC personnel wrestled with them and a truck loaded with 60 litres of PMS was seized, while three empty trucks sped away. “The driver of the seized truck destroyed its brakes in an attempt to deceive our men but to no avail. “The command has repaired the brakes to move the truck out of the creek so as to be able to deliver it to Nigerian National Petroleum  Corporation (NNPC).” The commandant said that the command was in search of other accomplices. “The two suspects have already been locked up and investigations began,” Ayeni added.
