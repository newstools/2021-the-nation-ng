Some hunters in Ogun State have surprisingly stumbled on a kidnap syndicate in the bush plotting to attack unsuspecting members of the public plying the Lagos – Ibadan expressway. The kidnap suspects were sighted at the Fidiwo stretch of the expressway by the hunters who alerted the Police. The suspects, Nathaniel Jacob, m’ 24 years old from Nasarawa state, Isah Danladi m’ 22years old from Kogi state and Abubakar Rabiu m’ 23 years old from Niger state, were arrested at the Fidiwo area following the tipoff from the hunters. The Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement, said police arrested three members of the kidnap syndicate on April 8 while others escaped. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said the suspects until their arrest, have been terrorising commuters along Lagos/Ibadan expressway for quite some time now. He explained hunters sighted them in the bush where they were planning on how to strike along the expressway and alerted the Police. “On interrogation, the suspects confessed to being in the bush for the past ten days, waiting for a convenient opportunity to strike. It took them that long because of a heavy presence of policemen on the stretch of the expressway,” Abimbola said. The Police spokesman said the suspects were a six-man kidnap gang adding while three were arrested, the others escaped with their arms. He noted that investigation had revealed that the gang was responsible for the series of kidnapping along the expressway. He added that the Police operatives recovered cutlasses which the suspects claimed were seized from farmers they met in their farms.
