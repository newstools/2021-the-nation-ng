Lagos has said it plans to hold local government elections in July. A statement by Chairman of the Lagos State Independence Electoral Commission (LASIEC), Justice Ayotunde Phillips (rtd), said election into the offices of chairman, vice chairman and councillors in the 20 councils and 37 LCDAs would hold that day. The statement reads: “LASIEC is committed to conducting a credible and inclusive election and the Statutory Notice shall be published soon.” Tenure of the incumbents, who have been in power since 2017, will expire in July and the state Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) had advised Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to make plans for a new election. IPAC chairman James Adeshina, who spoke against the backdrop of insinuations the State would not conduct council elections in 2021 since it was not provided for in the 2021 budget, said IPAC would not support the appointment of sole administrators or caretaker committees when the tenure of the incumbents expire.
