Zinedine Zidane has said he hopes Lionel Messi stays at Barcelona, saying his presence is “good for La Liga” ahead of an El Clasico clash that could help decide the title race. Real Madrid host Barcelona on Saturday with both teams looking to chase down leaders Atletico, with Barca just one point off the top, and Madrid two points further back. Messi has failed to score in the last seven Clasicos, last finding the net in the fixture in May 2018. He is yet to announce a decision on his future, with his Camp Nou contract expiring in June. “I hope he stays at Barcelona,” Zidane said when asked if this could be Messi’s last Clasico. “He’s fine there, and it’s good for the Spanish league too. “We know the player Messi is, that won’t change, even if he doesn’t score, “But we play against Barcelona. It’s Madrid-Barcelona. They’re all really good. We’ll try to overcome their strengths and we’ll try to play a good game with the ball.” Madrid go into the match in arguably their best form of the season having beaten Liverpool 3-1 in their Champions League quarterfinal first leg in midweek and have gone nine games unbeaten in La Liga.
