Prof. Kolawole Salako, the Vice-Chancellor,  Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), has decried the addiction and obsession of youths to irrelevant fantasy on Facebook and other social media platforms. Salako, who was speaking at a thanksgiving service to mark his 60th birthday in Abeokuta on Sunday, urged the youth to “face their books rather than facebook”. He decried the reluctance of contemporary students to reading their books and facing their studies. The don noted that today’s youths had bastardised the positive impact of technology, the social media in particular, by wasting quality times on immoral fantasy that did not add value to their lives and the society. “Unlike our days when we read and researched deeply, today’s youths are fond of consulting Google for answers to everything. “As a matter fact I started nursing the ambition of becoming a professor right from my secondary school days. “With determination and trust in God, any youth can achieve his or her dreams, irrespective of daunting challenges,” the vice-chancellor said Earlier in his sermon, the Pastor of Living Spring Chapel, Abeokuta,  Kayode Ojo who preached on the theme; ”Receiving God’s Power” described Salako as a man who feared God and relied on His power, before and now, as vice chancellor. He described the power of God as dependable, reliable and permanent, saying all other powers are temporal. Taking his sermon from the Books of John 1: 2 and Zechariah Chapter 9, the cleric charged the congregation to give their all to Christ, in order to have His unrivalled power. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that special prayers were offered for peace, progress and development of the country and for God’s continuous guidance, protection and prosperity of the vice chancellor and his family.
