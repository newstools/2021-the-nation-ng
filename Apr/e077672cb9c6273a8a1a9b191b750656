Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal has sworn in 23 newly elected council chairmen with a marching order to hold security meetings on fortnight basis. He also warned they should remain in their councils to serve the people. “You must not be found junketing from one hotel or location to another. Except for very obvious reason, you have to be in your respective councils to serve the people especially those in the most security troubled zone. “We shall be receiving minutes and reports on all security meetings from your respective councils to enable the state Security Council meeting take proactive measures and emergency steps towards addressing the menace,” he told them. Tambuwal, who administered the oath of office Wednesday on the elected chairmen, told them to uphold the confidence and trust reposed in them by effectively carrying out their responsibilities to the public in honesty with commitment. According to him, the third tier of government must be allowed to function effectively in order to advance the objects of its creation.
