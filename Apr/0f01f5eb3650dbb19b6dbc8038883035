A stalwart of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ajeromi-Ifelodun Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Chief Remi Williams on Tuesday celebrated his 92nd birthday at his Methodist Church in his hometown Agbowa in Lagos State.  In a message, the nonagenarian used the opportunity offered by the event to thank God for his benevolence, noting that many of his contemporaries were no more. Pa Williams advised politicians to play by the rules of the game. A firm believer in the late governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, who he called his leader, he said politicians and leaders should imbibe the good ideals left by the former governor. Reminiscing on the life and times of Jakande, Pa Williams said: “Jakande was one of the best governors and a friend I have ever seen. He was very honest and diligent. He was not a money grabber, and widely consulted before embarking on any project. He was a man of the people. His was a government without blemish.’’ He corrected the impression that Jakande unilaterally joined the late General Sanni Abacha, saying that he consulted many people and they urged him to take the position. On the National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Pa Williams said: “He is good, young and dynamic and has what it takes to be president.” Pa Williams decried the insecurity in the nation, advising the government to tackle the challenges with dispatch.
