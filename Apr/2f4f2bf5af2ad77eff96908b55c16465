The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has scheduled the 2021 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) second series for School candidates to hold between August 16 and September 30. A statement by WAEC”s Ag Head of Public Affairs, Mr. Demianus Ojijeogu, noted the examination could not hold during the usual May/June period because of the disruption to the school calendar caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Council debunked claims that Head of National Office, Mr. Patrick Areghan had announced a postponement of the examination, saying the date was decided on internationally by the WAEC member countries. The statement reads: “The arrangement is in line with the current academic calendar and was done in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Education. “Consequently, the Council wishes to inform schools, candidates and the general public that the examination will hold from August 16, 2021 to September 30, 2021. The International timetable for the conduct of the examination will be released in due course. “
