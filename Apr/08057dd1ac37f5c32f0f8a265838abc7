According to a statement by State House Deputy Director of Information, Mr Abiodun Oladunjoye, the appointment is with effect from April 10, 2021 Congratulating the Akajemeli on her re-appointment, the Permanent Secretary said: ‘‘She is a very hardworking person and who I have worked very closely with and she is very passionate in everything she does.’’ He also used the occasion of the presentation of the revised Service Charter to encourage public servants to put service delivery first and ‘‘not to be in a hurry to acquire material benefits.’’ ‘‘For people who are in a hurry to make money, the public service is not about making money. ‘‘I usually advise colleagues, particularly the younger generation, not to be in a hurry for anything but to work hard and the reward will meet you where you are,’’ he said The National Coordinator of SERVICOM described her reappointment as a call to do more in terms of improving service delivery in Nigeria. ‘‘We are working towards getting an Act to further drive and institutionalise service improvement in the country and we are also working towards a functional new national policy on SERVICOM to enhance trust and connectedness between the government and the citizenry,’’ she said. Working with the Open Government Partnership (OGP), Akajemeli hinted that SERVICOM had plans to expand its frontiers to the States and local governments to improve the essence of governance.
