A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), the Foundation for Partnership Initiative in the Niger Delta (PIND), has identified access to arable land for agriculture as a major challenge militating against optimal productivity by rural farmers in the Niger Delta. The foundation’s Advocacy Manager, Chuks Ofulue, who spoke at a round-table talk organised by PIND in Asaba, Delta State, said increased access to farming land would increase food production and improve the quality of lives of vulnerable citizens in the Niger Delta. He said before the event, the foundation conducted a study on access to agricultural land in Edo, Ondo and Delta states. “We know that access to land is the fundamental means whereby the poor can ensure food supplies to meet and generate income through production and processing as a means of livelihood. “Yet, access to arable land remains a major constraint to the increased productivity of small farm holders in Nigeria, particularly in Niger Delta,” Ofulue said. He said Niger Delta suffers from a shortage of arable land due to its surrounding water. He said PIND Foundation also launched a report on the factors affecting farmer’s productivity in the region.
