Taiwo Awoniyi has been named in Royal Excel Mouscron’s all-time XI despite staying at the club for just two years. Awoniyi, who is currently on loan at Union Berlin from Liverpool, had two separate loan spells with the Belgian side. His first year at the club was in the 2017/2018 campaign before spending the last six months of the 2018/2019 season. Awoniyi has had a rough start to his senior career since signing for Liverpool in 2015. The former Golden Eaglets star contract with the Reds runs till 2023, but he has spent every season out on loan. His time at Mouscron remains the best spell of his senior career, which has earned him a spot in the team’s all-time XI. The 23-year-old scored 21 goals and registered ten assists in 43 games across his two stints at the club. And in a 4-3-3 all-time XI released by Mouscron and shared on Awoniyi Instagram stories, the Nigerian striker was supported by Abdoulay Diaby and Manuel Benson in the attack. Awoniyi hasn’t reached those heights since then, although he appeared to have found his feet again at Union before his injury. The former Dream Team striker has scored five times and provided four assists in 19 league games for Die Eisernen.
