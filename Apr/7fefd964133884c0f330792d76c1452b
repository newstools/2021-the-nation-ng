Suspected herdsmen have invaded Koka village in Obokun council area of Osun State but hunters in the community gave them a fight, preventing them from abducting anyone. It was gathered that the armed herdsmen invaded the village about 11:50pm on Sunday. A source in the village told The Nation that the herdsmen stormed the village and started to forcefully pick villagers from homes randomly. According to him, “Those that attacked us are herdsmen, they were armed and threatening to kill anybody that dares them. One of the villagers informed the hunters group on the phone about the attack and they moved to our village. “When they arrived in the village and engaged the herdsmen, the victims they abducted escaped the scene. Police spokesman Yemisi Opalola, said, “Some hoodlums suspected to be herdsmen attacked Koka village and villagers and hunters moved against them. They engaged the hoodlums in a gun battle to liberate themselves.”
