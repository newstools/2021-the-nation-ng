 Following his substitution as an injury precaution against Reading last weekend, William Troost-Ekong is a doubt for today’s Watford away tie to Luton Town in English Championship. According to a statement by Watford, Nathaniel Chalobah and Troost-Ekong – both of whom were substituted as an injury precaution at home to Reading – are pushing to be part of the plans for the trip to Luton Town this weekend, with a final call on their involvement today. Tom Cleverley will be hoping to join them in the travelling party to Kenilworth Road. He’s worked hard all week after a knee injury set-back and will be assessed tomorrow. Troy Deeney has his eyes fixed on working outdoors very soon after making excellent progress with running and other strengthening work in the gym as he continues to rehab from an Achilles tear. After his October ACL injury, Tom Dele-Bashiru’s steady progress means he’s now targeting some kind of involvement in first-team training before the end of the season. His strengthening work continues out on the grass at Watford FC’s London Colney training facility.
