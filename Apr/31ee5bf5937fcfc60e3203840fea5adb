Arsenal impressively swept aside Slavia Prague to reach the Europa League semi-finals with a fine away victory in the second leg. The night had potential to be a nervy affair with the tie evenly poised at 1-1 but the Gunners produced one of their best performances of the campaign to keep alive their hopes of European qualification for next season. They scored three goals in the opening 24 minutes and had another ruled out by the video assistant referee – all-but ending the contest in the opening period. Nicolas Pepe squeezed home at the near post to open the scoring in the 18th minute before Alexandre Lacazette converted a penalty three minutes later following a foul on Bukayo Saka. Saka coolly swept in the third as Arsenal tore their Czech opponents apart once more. Mikel Arteta’s side controlled the game expertly thereafter and Lacazette smashed his second low into the net in the latter stages. The Gunners will face Villarreal – managed by former Arsenal boss Unai Emery – in the last four.
