The Federal University of Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, (FUOYE) has approved an insurance package of N3.1 million at N125,000 each for 25 students to enable them complete their programmes. The students are those unable to continue with their education as a result of the death of their parents or guardians. The Dean of Student Affairs, Prof. Dosu Malomo, said the scheme would take care of the students’ tuition and other need. He said over 100 students had benefited from the scheme since it was set up. Malomo noted that the N125,000 was to the students continue with their education in the university. He said: “The students who benefitted from the scheme expressed their gratitude to the university’s management team for making their dreams a reality, notwithstanding their financial constraints. “They thanked  the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Abayomi Fasina and his team for showing support towards their education. “They prayed that God will bless their children too and make them achieve the best in their future endeavours.” Malomo, who unveiled the scheme, said the insurance package was introduced as a special policy to cater for students who suddenly lost their parents or guardians responsible for funding their education. “Students will on submission of relevant documents, be screened for the claims of about N125, 000 each. The funds are sourced from the premium of N1, 000 paid by all students each session. “The criteria for qualifying for the package include earlier payment of the N1,000 premium along with school fees, losing a parent or guardian or the parent or guardian becoming fatally injured to a state of permanent disability,” he said. Meanwhile, staff members of FUOYE have also hailed the vice chancellor for approving a proposal for special consideration for their biological children to get admissions into the university’s academic programmes.
