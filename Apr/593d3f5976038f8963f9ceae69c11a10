The Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) on Friday said the discovery of mineral deposits and its illegal prospect were responsible for the recent killings in Effium, Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi state by hired militia. The persistent attacks in the area since the beginning of the year have led to loss of lives and destruction of several property worth millions. The President of the association, Ambassador Paschal Oluchukwu, in a statement in Abuja on Friday said “the discovery of mineral deposits in the area is the actual cause of the lingering conflict in the once peaceful communities.” Oluchukwu alleged attempt by the government in partnership with an investor from neighbouring state to mine the minerals was responsible for the killings. The association noted: “It has come to the notice of AESID that the discovery of some mineral deposits such as Lead, Tin, Zinc and some deposits of crude oil is the main reason the Korri natives are hell bent on wiping out the rest of other dwellers in Effium and the Ezzas who have the highest population from the area.” The group however said it is not against any investor mining the “God’s given mineral deposits in any land so long the requirements of the law are met and government in turn give support for such exploration to be carried out. The statement tasked the state government to come out open and clear the air and assure the people of Effium on their safety.
