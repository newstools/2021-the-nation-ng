 Nollywood actresses, Uche Ogbodo and Lola Margaret have lauded Dayo Amusa’s stand on fans and fake displays of love. Dayo Amusa says her true fans should express their love for her while alive or keep it to themselves when she’s dead. The ‘Unforgivable’ actress made this comment while reacting to how people praise and eulogise Nigerian celebrities in death. “I don’t need to get loved when I am dead. If I can’t feel it while I’m here. Keep it!” Amusa posted on her Twitter page. Ogbodo and Margaret took turns in supporting Amusa’s take with love emojis. Ogbodo went further to say she appreciates and loves Amusa more for taking such a stand.  Reacting to Amusa’s take, filmmaker Abiodun Jimoh, also said, “Hmmm. The level of humanities among humans these days is below average.” The death of a celebrity invokes a mix of emotions from fans who are quick to rush to write tributes on social media. However, Amusa is not in support of such trends saying she does not need to be loved when she is dead. Between 2020 and 2021, the Nigerian Entertainment Industry has lost a number of stars, including Yoruba actress, Folake Aremu aka Orisabunmi, Bruno Iwuoha, Ernest Asuzu, Sadiq Daba, Jim Lawson Maduike, Dokta Frabz among others.
