A Professor of English and Media/Digital Communication, Department of Languages and General Studies, Covenant Universe, Prof. Innocent Chiluwa, has expressed support for Hate Speech Bill but maintained that death penalty for the offence is too extreme. Chiluwa said this at the 23rd inaugural lecture held at the Chapel Hall of Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State. The lecture was tagged: Language in Conflict and Peace: Representations of Identities and Interests in the Media and the Internet. He said â€œI am aware that there is currently the prohibition of Hate Speech Bill that has passed its second reading at the Nigeria Senate. The proposed law recommended life imprisonment and even death by hanging if the actions of hate speech, which include written or visuals acts or any publication that threatened or incite ethnic hatred, or is abusive, insulting or offensive, results in loss of life.
