Elder statesman and Chairman, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Elders Council – Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, has called for synergy and collaboration between the newly floated South East Security Outfit code named Ebube Agu and the IPOB’s Eastern Security Network (ESN) to tackle the current security challenges in the region. Iwuanyanwu, who spoke to newsmen in Owerri said that it is imperative for the Ebubeagu whose idea was jointly mooted in  2019 by the leadership of the  Ohanaeze Ndigbo and governors of the Southeast to establish an intelligence department. The elder statesman advised the two security outfits to share information with the South West, South South and other neighbouring  regions of the  South east, and invest heavily in  intelligence gathering to find  out  reasons  behind persistent insurgence in the  region. “The elders of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo will work towards getting the IPOB-ESN to work with the Ebubeagu because we want a situation where all hands should be on deck to protect the region from bandits and terrorists. I would not want to believe that IPOB-ESN is responsible for what is now happening in the South East because IPOB ESN is made up of Igbo and as such, they cannot just come and start killing their fellow Igbo men”. He insisted that the  greatest threat to the nation’s security are the Boko Haram sect and the Islamic State of West Africa (ISWA). He also urged the federal government  to set up a panel of inquiry to ascertain the whereabouts of the  Air-force plane that recently disappeared and that  crashed, lamenting that  the nation appears not to appreciate the magnitude  of the problem confronting her.
