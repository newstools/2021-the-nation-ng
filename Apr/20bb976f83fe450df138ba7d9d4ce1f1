Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly has no plans to stick around at Juventus if they fail to reach next season’s Champions League – with Paris Saint-Germain or Manchester United his likely destination. Tuttosport report that the French champions, along with a reunion at Old Trafford, are two options for the 36-year-old if he elects to cut short his time in Italy this summer. A score draw at Fiorentina over the weekend has left Juventus’ hopes of a top-four finish – and, crucially, a spot in next season’s Champions League – in doubt. Ronaldo is contracted to Juventus until 2022 but it is widely considered that missing out on Europe’s premier club competition would make keeping him financially unsustainable. His contract is worth around £27million and Europa League football would not provide the necessary funds. Ronaldo has won the Champions League five times – four with Real Madrid and once with Manchester United – and he knows he is running out of opportunities to win a sixth European crown, raising doubts over his stay at Juventus. During his time in Italy he has been eliminated by Ajax, Lyon and Porto in what has proved a bitterly disappointing spell – in Europe at least. Juventus currently sit fourth, level on points with third-placed Napoli as well as fifth-placed AC Milan in a fiercely close top-four race. Atalanta are two point ahead in second with Inter Milan way out in front and cruising to the title. Ronaldo and Co still have to play Udinese, AC Milan, Sassuolo, Inter Milan and Bologna to round off the Serie A season.
