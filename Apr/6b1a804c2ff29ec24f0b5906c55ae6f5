Former Imo Governor Senator Rochas Okorocha has explained why he cooperated with officials of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) during his two-day detention. Okorocha was on Tuesday evening arrested by officials of the anti-graft agency in private office at Nkwerre Street in Garki area of Abuja. However, the Imo West Senator, who was released after 48 hours, said he cooperated with the commission because it operated within the ambit of the law establishing it. In a statement through his media adviser, the former Governor said another reason he cooperated with the EFCC was because he was only keen in his having the needed opportunity to address the allegations contained in the avalanche of petitions written by the lmo State government against him. The statement reads: “It should be recalled that , we had , in our reaction to his trip to the EFCC office, on the invitation of the Commission assured that , the former lmo Governor, would fully cooperate with the agents of the Commission since it was operating within the arm-pit of the law establishing it. “And we are happy to inform that, the Distinguished Senator, lived up to that vow or promise. We didn’t bother about whether he spent 24 hours or 48 hours at the Commission’s office. ‘’We were only keen in his having the needed opportunity to address the allegations contained in the avalanche of petitions written by the lmo State Government against the former Governor. “Remember also that, we had alluded that, EFCC was not a slaughter house but a responsible institution, established for the good of the nation and her people. ‘’And Okorocha being in his house today, only confirmed our hypothesis that, indeed, the commission’s office is not an abattoir”.
