The Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) has called for the promotion of reading culture, especially amongst children and young persons. This, it said, would contribute to national development. Its Director-General, Mr John Asein, said the theme of this year’s event points to the role of books as veritable tools of development. Asein, represented by a director, Mr Mathew Ojo, said: “Authors, publishers, printers, booksellers, teachers, librarians and readers are stakeholders in the industry. “Books educate, enlighten, entertain and equip individuals to function better and contribute significantly to the social, economic and political development of a nation. “For books to contribute meaningfully to development, they must not only be well written and published but must also be made readily available.” Asein said reading would help build children’s character and assist them in imbibing the core values that society cherishes.
