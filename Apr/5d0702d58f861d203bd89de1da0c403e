Singer and dancer, Peter Okoye aka Mr. P is unbothered if fans love his music or not. Mr. P made this assertion on Instagram live in response to his trolls and faultfinders. According to the 39-year-old singer, he would not beg for fans to love his sounds as he had been able to gather die-hard fans since he stepped out as a solo artist. “People said I’m too harsh. Yes. I don’t beg for fans and it is nobody’s business,” he said. Continuing, the twin said, ” I don’t owe anybody explanation over PSquare or my family. I will never discuss that, it is my family problem, not yours.” The Afropop singer who recently released his debut album, ‘The Prodigal’ disclosed that he had to postpone the body of work more than four times to satisfy fans. “The Prodigal is proof that I’ve moved on. There’s a lot of time and energy I’ve spent on this album. I postponed the album more than 4 times. I have 16 songs meaning, I can now do my thing on my own and I can go on stage to perform for 6 hours. “When I woke up this morning, the album had already reached 1 million-plus stream on Audiomack in less than 48 hours, 15Million plus worldwide, top 10 on Spotify, iTunes. It shows that I have a lot of followers. I have one of the albums of the year 2021. Team P I love and heart you guys, man! God bless you guys. This is really overwhelming.”
