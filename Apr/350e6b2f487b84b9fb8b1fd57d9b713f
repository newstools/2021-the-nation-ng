During PSG’s 3-2 Champions League win over Bayern Munich, Jamie Carragher made the surprising claim on commentary that Kylian Mbappe had “never done it at the highest level”. In all seriousness, there is a growing sense in some quarters that the young Frenchman has outgrown his native top flight. Losing both Mbappe and Neymar in one summer would be catastrophic for Mauricio Pochettino, but it’s long been touted as a potential reality, with just one destination in mind for the Brazilian: his old haunt of Barcelona. Mbappe’s future is a little more uncertain, but two reports emerged which might shed some light on his intentions. According to The Telegraph, there’s now “genuine concern” that he’ll move on and it’s now only “50/50” that he’ll stay at Parc des Princes. He continues to resist signing a contract extension, despite sporting director Leonardo’s best efforts dating back more than a year. The report adds that some within the club think Mbappe has become “distracted” and while PSG don’t want to sell, it is possible they could accept a fee deterred over a number of years rather than a one-off transfer payment from one of Europe’s top clubs. It’s also emerged from Spain, specifically from Cadena Ser that Mbappe himself has decided on his next move, officially telling PSG he wants to leave. The 22-year-old has decided he wants to join Real Madrid – but here’s where the plot thickens. It’s stated Los Blancos also  want to sign Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund this summer – and this doesn’t sound like an ‘either, or’. “Mbappe isn’t the only marquee signing Madrid are eyeing ahead of the summer transfer window,” AS state. “Like Mbappe, the 20-year-old… has identified the Spanish capital as his destination of choice.”
