GOSPEL reggae artist, Chukwuemeka Kpadobi aka Tonneil Avo, has shared the story of how a track in his second album ‘Testimonies’, became the mental and spiritual tonic that helped a fan survive the lockdown in the United Kingdom. “In fact, some of my fans call my songs; ‘antidepressants’ as they listen in the place of meditation, relaxation, and through their daily routine. “You’ll find most of those songs in my second album; ‘Testimonies.’ During the lockdown, a fan of mine based in the UK played the song online back-to-back and cued into the anointing and drew strength, hope, and joy to move on through those trying times to the glory of God,” he said. Kpadobi explained further that his songs are simple, yet laced with heavy lyrics and spiritual depth, which often inspire those on the verge of giving up in life, or battling drugs, marital hiccups, sickness, stress, spiritual attacks, poverty, among other challenges. Kpadobi who spoke in Lagos, while introducing his new album tagged: ‘Salvation is free’, said excellence and righteousness should be the hallmark of the gospel industry. “And this song; ‘Salvation is Free’ became an eye-opener that Jesus Christ got our back always. The good news is that it’s danceable, infotainment, entertaining, soul-refreshing and it heals,” he said. He lamented the lack of spirituality among gospel musicians in the country, adding that the industry is laced with worldliness, mediocrity, and compromise.
