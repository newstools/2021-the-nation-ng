Ekiti State Government has released N250 million for the payment of outstanding pensions to another set of 86 retirees in the state, the Acting Executive Secretary, Ekiti Pension Transitional Arrangement, Mr Francis Omotoso, has said. Omotosho, who made this known in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, said the amount is part of the monthly releases by the Governor Kayode Fayemi’s administration for the settlement of outstanding retirement benefits for pensioners. He added that the cash would be used to offset the outstanding balance of pension for May and June. He said the earlier proposed scheme aimed at further paying the backlog of retirees’gratuities through a negotiated discount process had been jettisoned. He stressed the government’s commitment to the welfare of the people, particularly the elderly who had served the state meritoriously. Omotosho noted that the governor had promised to regularly release tranches of N250 million for payment of pensions until outstanding retirement benefits were cleared. The state Head of Service, Mrs Peju Babafemi, advised the affected pensioners to be prudent with their resources and expend them on veritable ventures that would improve their lives. Babafemi noted that if the pensioners  planned and managed their ventures well, it would guarantee a stable and comfortable future for them and their families. The Chairman, Nigeria Union of Pensioners, Ekiti chapter, Mr Joel Akinola, on his part, lauded the government for its efforts at improving the lots of pensioners in the state.
