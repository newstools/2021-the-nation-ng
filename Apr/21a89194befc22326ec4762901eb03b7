The 36 clubs in Germany’s top two leagues will go into compulsory “quarantine training camps” for the last two match days of the Bundesliga season, the German Football League (DFL) has announced, to ensure the fixture schedule is completed on time. Clubs in the first and second Bundesliga will go into camp from May 12 until the final weekend of the season on May 23. With Germany currently in the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DFL has tightened hygiene restrictions. The league has ordered clubs to fully isolate their squads for the last 10 days of the season to make sure it can be finished on time ahead of Euro 2020, which runs from June 11-July 11. “The ‘quarantine training camps’ serve to additionally secure… match operations – especially taking into account the deadline pressure due to the UEFA EURO following the season,” said the DFL in a statement. Bayern Munich, who are 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga, are set to be confirmed as German champions for the ninth consecutive season tomorrow  at Mainz.
