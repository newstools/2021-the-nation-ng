 Juju music legend, Chief Ebenezer Obey-Fabiyi, is 79 today, April 3. Obey, whose professional career as a musician began in the mid-1950s, has chosen to celebrate his birthday moderately. However, the Gospel Musicians Association of Nigeria (GOMAN) has lauded the legendary gospel musician as he celebrates the milestone age. The music artists converged in Abeokuta to celebrate Obey, who is regarded as a role model and one who has contributed to the development of music in Nigeria.  Speaking at the event, the National President of GOMAN, Evangelist Funmi Aragbaye encouraged Nigerians to always strive to use their talents to uplift the society regardless of the prevailing challenges. Aragbaye noted that people’s dedication and willingness to be of service to humanity would enable them to follow God’s way of bringing to pass His plan and purpose for every destiny. In his response, Obey expressed his appreciation to God for sparing his life as well as the Ogun State chapter of GOMAN for adding glamour to his planned low-key birthday celebration. Obey was born on April 3, 1942, to an Egba–Yoruba ethnic background family. He is of the Owu subgroup of the Egba, Abeokuta, Ogun state.
