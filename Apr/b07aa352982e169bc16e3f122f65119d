 In-form Lorient striker Terem Moffi has been recognized for his outstanding performance this past weekend after he was named into the French Ligue 1 Team of the Week, by French national daily newspaper devoted to sport, L’Équipe. The 21-year-old scored a brilliant hat trick to give Les Merlus all three points against Bordeaux in their league encounter on Sunday, taking his goal tally for the season to his tally to 14 league goals- the most scored by a Nigerian in the French top-flight in a single season since Victor Ikpeba scored 16 for Monaco in the 97/98 season. With a rating of 9.34, the 21-year-old scored 3 goals from just 4 shots on target, winning 3 duels and also completing 66.% of his passes.  Moffi’s form in 2021 has however been outstanding in the league, with the striker scoring 12 goals since the turn of the year with that haul only bettered by French star Kylian Mbappe who has scored 14 goals since the start of January. Christophe Pélissier, Moffi’s manager at Lorient is not surprised at the former Kortkijk of Belgium forward form, adding that Moffi has not reached his full potentials judging from his performances during training. “Moffi arrived late, he had a difficult start, but it is no revelation for us with what he does in training, and what he will continue to do. It is not yet at 100% of its potential,” Pélissier told L’Équipe. “I don’t stop at the success of a player, but of a super-efficient attacking duo (Moffi – Wissa), because the team was very strong in pressing. We know the qualities of this duo.”
