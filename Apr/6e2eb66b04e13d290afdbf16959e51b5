The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has expressed appreciation to the Federal Government as well as the governments of Akwa Ibom, Edo and Lagos States for their immense contributions towards the Super Eagles’ qualification for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon. Success in the qualifying race will see the three –time champions make their 19th appearance in the biggest football tournament on the African continent. For the third consecutive major tournament, the Super Eagles qualified ahead of the final day of hostilities, this time with two matches to spare, doing better than even the one-match-to-spare accomplishments ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup finals and the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Captain Ahmed Musa and team mates dropped only four points from a possible 18 (draws at home and away to Sierra Leone) and never looked in danger of failing to reach Africa’s flagship tournament. NFF President Amaju Melvin Pinnick, said: “Our heartfelt appreciation goes to the Federal Government, right from His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR. Without the total support and encouragement of the government, it would not have been possible. Our appreciation also goes to all agencies of government who have been of help along the way. “We are also very appreciative of the Chief of Staff to Mr. President. He has continued to be a pillar of support. The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Nigeria Council for Disease Control provided huge assistance and guidance in a difficult period for the whole world; certainly, things would have been impossible without their understanding and co-operation. “The Governments of Akwa Ibom, Delta, Edo and Lagos States played the role of good hosts to the Super Eagles before and during the campaign and were very magnanimous to the players and officials. The NFF is very, very grateful to them because without them, the task would have been close to insurmountable.”
