INSTAGRAM sensation, Mr Macaroni’s sidekick in skits, Kemi Ikuseedun aka Mummy Wa has opened up on their relationship. Popular for her role as Mummy Wa, Ikuseedun noted that people misunderstand her role as Macaroni’s lover in the skits for reality saying they only share a working relationship. “People assume that I am dating Mr Macaroni in real life.

Some people think we are married in real life,” said Mummy Wa. The internet sensation also showered encomium on Mr Macaroni for giving her the platform to express her talent. “At the beginning, it was looking a little bit bumpy and rocky, and all of a sudden, everything became smooth.
