Decomposed and decapitated bodies of eight persons have been found in a valley off the 11 Miles axis of the Federal Highway on the outskirts of Calabar, the Cross River State capital. Local farmers found the bodies on Tuesday and raised the alarm which attracted some travellers and passersby. Spokesman of the state command of the Nigeria Security Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) Eremi confirmed that the discovery of the bodies, which consisted of seven male and one female. He said for now no one knows how the bodies got there or who killed them but “we have taken note of the incident and proper investigation will be done”. He added that the appropriate authorities have been informed for the purpose of evacuating the bodies from the place. A local source who did not want his name in print alleged that the bodies may have been those of suspected criminals killed extra-judicially. The source supported his claims with another allegation that a similar incident, “with four dead bodies occurred last month in the same area and one of the bodies identified at that time was that of a crime suspect fondly called Ekpri-Ntoe who was declared wanted by the State government. Police spokesman Irene Ugbo did not take the reporter’s calls. Permanent Secretary, State Security Adviser, office of the Governor, Mr. Alfred Mboto denied any knowledge of the incident, and also dismissed the allegation of a possible extra-judicial killing. “It is possible that the killing may be the outcome of a clash by cult groups who have been fighting themselves,” he said.
