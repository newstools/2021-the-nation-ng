Leicester City’s  Keeper Kasper Schmeichel believes Nigeria  international Kelechi Iheanacho could be awkward  ti play against which may have accounted  for his scoring resurgence with the Foxes. Excited over Leicester’s FA Cup final berth in 52 years, the Danish knows now is the time to strengthen their concentration as they prepare to contest a number of important Premier League matches before the final takes place in mid-May. It’s a very old, boring football cliché, but we can’t look that far ahead. There’s a massive, massive job ahead of us to stay in the top four. Focus shifts to Thursday now.” Sunday’s goal scorer, Iheanacho, took his tally over the last seven games in all competitions to a brilliant haul of 10 goals, side-footing in the winner after some fine work from Jamie Vardy on the left flank on 55 minutes. When asked to describe Iheanacho, Schmeichel said: “Incredible form, incredible guy, incredible player. Kelly (Kelechi Iheanacho) has been working so hard ever since he joined the Club. “He just needed that bit of luck to give him the confidence – that goal, or whatever it was – because he does it in training every day and we see him every day. He’s horrible to play against sometimes, so I’m just buzzing for him that it’s coming to fruition in games.” Despite an extensive professional playing career that began back in 2005 at Manchester City, the Foxes’ clash with Chelsea at Wembley Stadium next month will be the first final Schmeichel has ever contested.
