There are strong  indications that Victor Osimhen may be rested when Napoli host Lazio tomorrow in a Serie A tie at the Maradona Stadium. Osimhen featured in Napoli’s 1-1 home draw against league leader inter Milan  that  ended  the winning streak but words are rife  that  coach Gennaro Gattuso is tinkering  with the attacking  partnership of  Dries Mertens and Hirving Lozano against Lazio. Italian tabloid Corriere dello Sport claimed  Gattuso may trigger some changes in the attack for the home match :“Demme is disqualified and in his place there will be Bakayoko , but not only: in attack, in fact, Osimhen could rest, with Mertens holder, while Lozano , who returns after the disqualification, could make Politano catch his breath by finding a starting shirt.” Speaking about the ill-fated 1-1 draw against Inter, Italian legend Giuseppe Galderisi believes Napoli should have done more. “Napoli could do more against Inter? The first time I liked, Inter have thought more to close the gaps. When the game could take a different turn, Napoli made little use of the spaces that were there and lowered too much.” Yet the rank and file of Napoli is looking forward  to tomorrow’s game  with optimism. “It ends 1-1 between Napoli and Inter at the Maradona Stadium,” the club said in a statement.“ The Azzurri draw against the leaders, a very close relative of the future Italian champion team.
“Napoli conquers the eighth positive result in the last nine  matches and continues its assault on the Champions area. “Thursday another high-altitude duel against Lazio at the Maradona Stadium; there are two months and seven games left for the season. The stretch of the decisive rush begins,” the statement added.
