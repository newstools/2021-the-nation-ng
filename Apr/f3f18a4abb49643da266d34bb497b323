One of Nollywood’s highest-grossing movies of 2020, Dear Affy, will make its Netflix debut in May 2021. In a chat with the CEO of 007 Global, Samuel BigSam Olatunji, the film will start showing on Netflix on May 11, 2021. “For the people who didn’t get to see the movie, this is your chance to see it and for the people who only got to see it once, you all should get ready as it will be released on Netflix on the 11th of May 2021. I have waited pretty long for this news because sadly the Coronavirus outbreak deterred our impressive cinema run which drastically reduced the chances of people that got to see the movie but finally I feel more people will get to see the beautiful piece of work we put together with Netflix accepting it,” Bigsam said. The romantic comedy which features a stellar cast including Toyin Abraham, Kehinde Bankole, Williams Uchemba, Timini Egbuson, Enyinna Nwigwe, Bimbo Ademoye, Odunlade Adekola, Uzor Arukwe, Faithia Williams, Seilat Adebowale, and Ali Nuhu, tells the story of an organized ardent female art enthusiast who is about to marry a man of her cherishing dreams then faces sudden obstacles and challenges after becoming pregnant accidentally even before her marriage. This spoiled her well-prepared laid-out plans and strategies and she embarked on a challenging mission in search of the father of the unborn baby. ‘Dear Affy’ grossed over N40 Million in two weeks of release but was cut short as the lockdown occasioned by coronavirus pandemic affected its run in the cinemas.
