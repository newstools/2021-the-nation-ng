An inferno has gutted parts of the Delta Police Command in Asaba destroying the communication control room. Delta Police image-maker, DSP Bright Edafe, in a statement, said the fire, which started around 2.45 pm, affected only parts of the Command control room. It is unclear how much damage the outbreak caused as the command control room houses sensitive communication gadgets. He said the timely intervention of the State Fire service saved the day. The statement said the cause of the fire was unknown but suspected an electrical spark from the communications engine room. It said an investigation had commenced to unravel the cause of the outbreak, urging the public to ignore any rumour contrary to the actual facts. But a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said sabotage could not be completely ruled out following recent attacks on police formations in parts of the country.
