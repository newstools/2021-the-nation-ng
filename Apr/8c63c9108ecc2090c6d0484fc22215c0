Southsouth leaders have passed a vote of confidence on the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Chief Godswill Akpabio, praising him for impurity and indiscipline from the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). They also advised Nigerians not to allow themselves to be held captive by men with unprecedented capacity for lies, mischief and treachery. The leaders, in a statement in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, described as malicious and devilish the campaign of calumny against Akpabio. “Sensationalism is not an admirable feature of excellent journalism. We find the purport of the news story entitled:” How EFCC detained Godswill Akpabio for two hours after attempting to bribe agency chairman with $350,000” as misleading”  The leaders condemned critics of Akpabio for abuses, lies and wild allegations. They alleged that some individuals are spreading untrue tales against Akpabio and NDDC. “Some individuals are stepping up their covert and overt moves to cause confusion in the country. Miscreants have been recruited to insult and blackmail the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs” The comments by Comrade Damian Nwikinaka of the Niger Delta Renaissance Coalition on the forensic audit in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) also drew fierce criticism from the South-South leaders. The leaders described the utterances of Nwikinaka as reckless, ridiculous, unbelievable, disgusting, inaccurate and insulting. “Nwikinaka has consciously and definitely shown disdain for the Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Chief Godswill Akpabio” The statement by the Chairman of Southsouth Front (SSF), Chief John Harry, refuted some of the distractions spewing from unguarded quarters in the country, saying those behind them do not wish the Niger Delta region well.
