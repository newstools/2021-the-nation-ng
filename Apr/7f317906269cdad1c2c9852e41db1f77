 Don Crucifixto, a fast-growing record label, has signed three new artists. The new signees are coming on the label’s board a few months after it launched on the Nigerian entertainment scene. The newly signed music acts are Adefioye Adelanaire aka Ewa, Kabir Omeiza aka Kabir, and Toluwalope Temidayo aka Dayz.  Reiterating his zeal to invest in Nigerian-born music acts, Don Crucifixto boss, Tumininu Oluyole said the new signees are young and vibrant to take the industry by storm. Speaking on the latest development, the label’s Artiste & Repertoire, Sean Dampte, expressed confidence saying, “these young artists would be releasing hits back to back, and Ewa would be coming out with an official single in a couple of weeks.”
