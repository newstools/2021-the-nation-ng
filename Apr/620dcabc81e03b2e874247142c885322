The Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) has justified its new policy mandating all those desiring to benefit from its scholarship scheme to first take the examination organised by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). PAP said the new policy was designed to eliminate mediocrity in the scheme as the programme continued with its quest to transform ex-agitators into well-educated entrepreneurs and employable citizens capable of contributing meaningfully to the economic prosperity of the Niger Delta region and the nation at large. “To this end, the PAP came up with a new policy mandating every prospective scholarship candidate to take the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination as one of the criteria to qualify for PAP scholarship”, PAP’s Interim Administrator, Col. Milland Dixon Dikio, said in a statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Nneotaobase Egbe. Dikio, who urged delegates and all stakeholders to get onboard the train of success, appealed for calm from persons opposing the JAMB policy. He said the policy was vital for the personal, intellectual and mental growth and development of the delegates and  also crucial to the development and economic growth of the Niger Delta. He further explained that the PAP was focused on ensuring that beneficiaries of PAP scholarship were able to compete for placement in the best universities and primed to be major players in the knowledge-based world.
