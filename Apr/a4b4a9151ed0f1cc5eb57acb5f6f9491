Lawyers in Anambra State on Friday threatened to embark on mass protest over the lingering strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN). The lawyers under the auspices of the Committee of Chairmen of the branches of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) in the state expressed worry over the industrial action, issuing a seven-day ultimatum towards resolving the matter. Addressing reporters in Awka, Chairman of Committee of Chairmen of the eight branches of NBA, Kingsley Awuka, described the decision of the Governors’ Forum to suspend discussion and engagement of JUSUN as uncharitable, unpatriotic and totally unacceptable. He asked governor Willie Obiano to ignore the Governors’ Forum decision and quickly commence the implementation of the constitutional provisions relating to the financial autonomy of the Judiciary in the State. He said the Committee would be left with no option after expiration of the ultimatum to join forces with JUSUN and mobilize the public and civil society organizations in protests to ensure compliance. He said, “The attention of the Executive Governor is drawn to the rot and dilapidating state of infrastructure in the Anambra State Judiciary. Many High Courts, where Judges sit, are in dire straits.
