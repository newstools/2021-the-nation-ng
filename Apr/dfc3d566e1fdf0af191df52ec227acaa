 YBNL signee, Adedamola Adefolahan aka Fireboy has hinted at the release of his third album. “Depending on the vibe, I might have a project coming out for you guys this year. You know I’m a project guy, I’m all about legacy. I would really love to have another project this 2021 but at the same time I feel like whatever you’re doing you have to take your time, you have to have to be patient, you have to have control but most definitely maybe later this year,” he hinted. The multiple award-winning singer and songwriter made this known during a live video on Instagram saying the upcoming music project would ‘slap hard.’  “A Fireboy project will really slap but that’s after a couple of singles. I’m working on that right now and trying to make sure that whatever it is I’m dropping has to slap like an African mother because if it doesn’t slap that’s trouble.” The Obafemi Awolowo University graduate also hinted at a collaboration with Mavin artiste, Korede Bello when the latter joined the conversation. “Expect something from myself and Korede Bello soon. We go run am privately” Fireboy disclosed. Fireboy DML already has two albums to his credit, ‘Laughter, Tears, and Goosebumps,’ released in November 2019, and ‘Apollo,’ released in August 2020.
