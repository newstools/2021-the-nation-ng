Mabel Makun, an interior designer and wife of Nigerian A-list comedian Ayo Makun, has criticised the Department of Security Service(DSS) for failing to investigate a crime. The interior designer revealed how she has been battling with depression for months as a result some awful experience. The mother of one made two different posts on her Instagram page to voice dissatisfaction with the way the DSS has been treating a family petition with utmost disregard. The first post displayed picture of some DSS personnel while she tagged the DSS outfit in her caption: “So DSS Nigeria has a petition from my family in their office and for the past 6 months has refused to attend to it. “If there is anything I hate the most is having to put out private issues but from this part of the world, authorities have a way of not urgently attending to life threatening issues. “Should I start posting video evidences of this criminal act before actions will be taken against all the parties involved? “Or should we continue to be quiet while innocent citizens die every day in this country? I need everyone’s opinion please. @dssnigeria.” The second post had a different caption but still displayed a picture of the DSS personnel. She wrote: “So for months, I experienced the full meaning of depression. Till date, there are days that I still hide and cry my eyes out. “Only those very close to me can tell exactly what I went through trying to gain my sanity back. I am a lot better now but what about those that probably did not survive? Do the needful.”
