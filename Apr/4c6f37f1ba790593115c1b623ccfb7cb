Fire on Thursday gutted parts of Delta State Police Command headquarters in Asaba, destroying the communication control room. Spokesman Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Bright Edafe said in a statement that the fire, which started around 2.45pm, affected parts of the control room. At press time, it was unclear the extent of damage done by the fire. Edafe said prompt response by firefighters prevented the fire from escalating. He said the cause of the fire was unknown, but he suspected spark from the communications engine room. The police spokesman said investigation into the incident had begun. But a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said sabotage could not be ruled out, following recent attacks on police formations in parts of the country.
