The Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) has reiterated its determination at ensuring noiseless environment through the implementation of the relevant laws against noise polluters. Its General Manager, Dr Dolapo Fasawe, during a webinar session to mark the International Noise Awareness Day (1NAD), described noise as an essential component of urban development that cannot be totally eliminated, but can be controlled to an acceptable level. According to her, the government was disposed to right of individuals to the religion of choice but with total consideration and respect for the right of others to a reasonably quiet environment and peaceful living. She said all activities aiding disunity, disaffection and chaos amongst the residents must be totally shunned. She attributed the increase in noise pollution in the state to the springing up of illegal buildings and indiscriminate conversion of residential properties to religious/leisure use. “Our measures to regulate noise shall include discouraging use of noisy generators, sirens, vehicle horns in certain places and loudspeakers in public places. Also, to ensure new entertainment and religious facilities are soundproofed before granting approvals,” she said. Declaring the event open, Permanent Secretary, Office of the Environmental services, Mrs. Belinda Odeneye, hailed LASEPA for not relenting to bequeath to the people a friendly and conducive an environment devoid of environmental hazards. She called for corporation and support of all in the fight against noise pollution as the government alone cannot do it.
