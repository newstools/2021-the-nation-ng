Athletic are without any injuries for the game but defender Inigo Martinez and goalkeeper Unai Simon played 90 minutes for Spain on Wednesday night. Sunday’s big match in La Liga will see league leaders Atletico Madrid face a difficult visit to fourth-placed Sevilla in one of the toughest tests they will face between now and the end of the season.
