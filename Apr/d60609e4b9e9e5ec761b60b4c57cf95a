Wilfred Ndidi has admitted initial comparisons with N’golo Kante on his arrival at Leicester City irritated him. In 2017, Ndidi was a direct replacement for France star Kante, who played a big part in ‘The Foxes’ defying all the odds to win the Premier League. Ndidi maintained he has always wanted to be himself. “Yes it (comparisons) used to irritate me, but it’s football and I completely understand the fans because they love to find something to talk about,” he told the BBC. “Even before and then when I arrived at Leicester I heard it. “I only wanted to be Wilfred Ndidi and not someone else. “I focus on myself. I am always critical of myself. I do my best to improve as a footballer game by game and giving my best for my club. “The comparison with others, about who is better or if Kante and I play alike, is irrelevant to me. “I think all that comparison was for those who love to talk and I didn’t focus on it. “You’re comfortable when you are yourself and not listening or trying to be something you are not.” Ndidi has made 140 appearances for Leicester City, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists since the Premier League club splashed 15 million pounds to sign him from Belgian club Genk.
