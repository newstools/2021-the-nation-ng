Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai has said he did not appoint intermediaries to negotiate with bandits. The Governor made the clarification in a statement by Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan on Sunday. The statement reads: “The attention of the Kaduna State Government under the leadership of Governor Nasir El-Rufai has been drawn to reports in the media that it has appointed representatives to interface with bandits on its behalf. “The Kaduna State Government hereby clarifies firmly that such intermediaries have never been appointed. “The position of the Kaduna State Government remains the same: The Government will not negotiate with or pay ransoms to bandits. Any person who claims to do so in any capacity, if found, will be prosecuted accordingly. “Citizens are urged to report the details of any persons posing as official government negotiators to the Kaduna State Security Operations Room on 09034000060 and 08170189999, or email internal.security@kdsg.gov.ng.” 39 students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka Kaduna were kidnapped on March 11, 2021 while eight members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) were also abducted on March 26, 2021. All of them remain in captivity amid calls by their relations for government to negotiate with the abductors.
