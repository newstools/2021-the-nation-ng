Real Madrid moved top of La Liga with victory over Barcelona in an El Clasico played in torrential rain at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium. Karim Benzema broke the deadlock with a sublime near-post flick – his ninth goal in his past seven La Liga games.  Real doubled their lead before half-time through Toni Kroos’ deflected free-kick. Oscar Mingueza pulled one back for Barca before Madrid’s Casemiro was shown a late red card.
