Napoli forward Victor Osimhen contacted the woman who sells water on the streets of Lagos. ‘It hurts me to see you like this, I’m here to help you’. Osimhen was moved by an image of the Nigerian woman without a leg, forced to sell water in the streets of Lagos. He saw Mary Daniel’s tired face, with a basin on her head full of bottles and a shirt saying ‘no pain, no gain’. Osimhen started searching for the lady, asking for support on social media: “Help me find this woman.” Just 24 hours later, the Nigeria international and Mary Daniel spoke on a video call. “Hi, I’m happy to have found you. How are you? I know it’s not easy,” Osimhen said, according to Calciomercato.com. “I have been on the street too; it hurts too much to see you. “I broke my back, today I feel better and I’m here to help you.” Mary Daniel smiled and thanked Osimhen, who promised he will help her and scheduled a meeting when he returns for his holidays. In  a related development, intermediary Andrea D’Amico said he’s convinced  Osimhen will do well at Napoli. The 22-year-old has contributed five goals in 16 Serie A games since his move to the Partenopei but he was out from the start of November to mid-January with a shoulder injury and then coronavirus. D’Amico contributed to Osimhen’s arrival from LOSC Lille last summer and spoke to Radio Marte about the Nigerian striker’s performances in Naples. “In the last few games, he has played 308 minutes and scored three goals,” D’Amico said. “We know how difficult it is to settle immediately in Serie FA.Others champions of the past, not surprisingly, needed up to six months. Victor was unlucky, he couldn’t show how strong he is.”
