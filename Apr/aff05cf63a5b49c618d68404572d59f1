UFC’s Welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, earned not less than $1.5 million from his second round victory over Jorge Masvidal at UFC 261. Usman, a Nigerian, defeated Masvidal, a Mexican-American by knock out in front of 15,000-strong fans at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday. The victory is Usman’s fourth successive defence of the title. According to reports, the Nigerian is set to smile to the bank with an astonishing $1.5m while Masvidal will earn as much as $900,000 thanks to the crowd at the venue and a high Pay Per View sale. The Nigerian has a guaranteed $750,000 for the fight appearance and another $60,000 promotional bonus. He earned himself an extra $50,000 as his bout was selected as one of the two Performances of The Night as well as that of teammate, Rose Namajunas. His earnings from the PPV revenue is set to take his total accumulated earnings to $1.5m. Usman (33) has now won 18 straight fights with 14 of them coming in the UFC and continues to improve with every victory, his striking now almost as much of a threat as his legendary wrestling skillfulness.
