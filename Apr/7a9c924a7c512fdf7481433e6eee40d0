Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has sworn in Justice Aisha Bashir-Aliyu as the substantive Chief Judge of the state. She becomes the first female Chief Judge in Nasarawa State. Shortly after administering the Oath of Office on the new CJ, the Governor said his administration takes the judiciary as a critical institution providing the needed impetus to strengthen relationships among organs of government. He added that his administration will continue to support the judiciary, towards quick dispensation of justice, stressing that the government has approved the increase in subvention of the judiciary to allow for the implementation of the harmonisation law, as well as enhance allowances of Magistrates and Judges of Area Courts. Governor Sule appealed to members of the Judicial Staff Union currently on strike, to return to work in the interest of the people. The governor called on Justice Aisha Bashir-Aliyu to see her appointment as a litmus test, urging her to bring her wealth of experience to bear in the discharge of her onerous task. “You must remember that as head of the Judicial Arm of Government, you are the symbol of fairness, equity, justice and objectivity,” he stated. Governor Sule further urged the CJ to view her appointment as a call to serve the people, urging her to let the fear of God and public interest take precedence over personal interest, while carrying out her official duties.
