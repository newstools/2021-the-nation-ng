Three persons have been arrested for allegedly attempting to vandalize a 300KVA distribution substation property of Enugu Electricity Distribution PLC (EEDC) at Akwa-Ukwu, Nnewi District, Anambra State. The suspects identified as Uchenna Ncheta, from Ebonyi State; Chinedu Eze, from Ihiala, Anambra State and Chuks Michael, from Abia State, were apprehended by members of vigilance group. Head, Corporate Communications, EEDC, Emeka Ezeh, in a statement said the suspects were handed over to the Orba Police Division and subsequently transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Awka, Anambra State for further interrogation and possible prosecution.
