Leeds played the whole second half with 10 men as they secured an outstanding win in stoppage time to slow Manchester Cityâ€™s charge to the Premier League title. Stuart Dallas put Leeds ahead against the runaway leaders in the first half with a shot that went in off the post. Skipper Liam Cooper was then sent off for a challenge on Gabriel Jesus. Ferran Torres equalised but Leeds celebrated a famous win after Dallas scored a 91st-minute winner. Despite a first defeat since 7 March, City are only 11 points from guaranteeing a third league crown in four seasons under Pep Guardiola, with six matches left. The players wore black armbands and there was a period of silence before the game for Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died at the age of 99 on Friday. BBC
