There are strong indications that Nigeria may not be part of this weekend’s World Athletics Relays Silesia21 in Poland following the refusal of Polish Embassy in Nigeria to issue entry visas to Nigeria’s contingent. In a statement issued by the media office of the Minister of Youth and Sports Development yesterday, the ministry and Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) have moved to ensure Nigeria qualifies for the relay events at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. And to this end, the statement stated that a number of athletics meetings have been secured in the United States while a five-nation relay meet is also on the card to hold in Nigeria before the window for qualification closes on June 29. However, the factional President of AFN Engr. Ibrahim Shehu-Gusau has dismissed the reasons given by the ministry, blaming the ministry for misplacing the country’s priority. Gusau in a statement said: “The information at our disposal is that athletes who were supposed to represent Nigeria at the World Athletics Relays in Silesia, Poland were taken to the US Embassy to obtain visas for a training tour of an event they were yet to qualify for. “The scheduled relays in Poland were meant to enable Nigeria to secure qualification for the Olympic Games in Tokyo but to our disbelief, the athletes’ passports were diverted to the USA Embassy to secure visas for a training camp for an event they are yet to qualify for. How can a qualification competition in Poland which was our best bet be ignored for a training camp in the USA? Gusau queried. The ministry however, said that they are properly guided as Nigeria is not in any jeopardy. “We did not get to officially register the team until Thursday last week and apply for entry visas at the Polish Embassy. Upon our application, the Polish Embassy insisted it would take two weeks to process the visa applications and all entreaties for a quick consideration were ignored,” said Niyi Beyioku, the AFN Secretary General.
