 The 2021 Carabao Cup final between Tottenham and Manchester City will have 8,000 fans in attendance after it was confirmed as a pilot event to test the return of big crowds.  A BBC report said: ” A proportion of tickets will be made available to both clubs for the game at Wembley Stadium on 25 April.” The rest will be given to local residents in Brent and NHS staff.  Rick Parry, chair of the English Football League (EFL), said it was an “important milestone”.
