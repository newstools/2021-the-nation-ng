 Ekiti State Police Command has rescued two-year-old twins locked in a room for three days without food by their mother in Igbara-Odo, Ekiti South West Council Area of the state. Police spokesman Sunday Abutu, in a statement in Ado-Ekiti, said the mother of the babies Mrs Joy Fatoba threatened to kill them should anyone compel her to open the door. Abutu said the babies were rescued by the Command’s Rapid Response Squad (RRS) following the alarm raised by a good Samaritan about the incident. The statement reads in part, “Today being 05/04/2021 at about 0945hrs, a distress call was received from a good Samaritan that a lady, who was later identified as Joy Fatoba of IgbaraOdo, locked up her twin babies in her room since about three days ago without food and threatened to kill them should anyone compel her to open the door.  “During interrogation, the lady narrated that the father of her kids left her for Calabar during pregnancy and has refused to return to take care of her and the kids. “According to her, she could no longer fend for herself and her two kids recently because her hair dressing work started failing. “It was gathered that the two kids, who appear unhealthy, are already two years old but can neither walk nor stand on their own without support due to undernutrition. “As a result the babies were immediately taken to the hospital for medical care and examination while investigation has already commenced and the Command shall ensure the safety of the kids and their Mother,” it added.
