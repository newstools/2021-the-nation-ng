The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Anambra State has handed over a suspected human trafficker and five trafficked girls to the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) in the state. The Corps’ Sector Head of Operations Anthony Ogbodo said yesterday that the suspects and victims aged between 14 29 were intercepted on Tuesday night by the Corps patrol team at Umuokpu on Onitsha-Awka Expressway. He said the 36-year-old suspect Frank Lucky claimed he was on his way to Benin, Edo State from Benue State. He said the case was immediately reported to the Commission’s headquarters which directed the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) in the state be alerted for further investigations. He said, “The suspect was arrested by our patrol team team led by Route Commander Ugochukwu Ogbonna when they stopped a black Nissan Primera vehicle with registration number BEN468HP for seat belt violation. “They were about to book the driver for seat belt violation when they noticed five girls inside the vehicle which triggered their suspicion. The vehicle was later impounded and taken to the our office.” Ogbodo further disclosed that the suspect, who had attempted to induce the officers, claimed to be taking the girls to work as househelps and farmers in their family farmland in Benin. “The victims who said they were from Vandeikya in Benue State, also claimed they were going to Benin to sell pepper soup and liquor in a beer parlour,” he added.
