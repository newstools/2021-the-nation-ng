The Katsina State Government yesterday announced that it has attained 79% vaccination rate in the first phase of the implementation of the COVID-19 Vaccination campaign. Executive Secretary, Katsina State Primary healthcare Development Agency (PHCDA) Dr. Shammsudeen Yahaya told The Nation that the state has achieved its primary target of reaching the frontline health workers during phase 1 of the vaccination campaign. He said: “Katsina State has implemented the COVID 19 Vaccination campaign Phase 1 for 12 days and has reached 79% of the target population, which are frontline health workers, other frontline workers, including security personnel and strategic leaders. The campaign was largely successful.” “We have also vaccinated State Contingent to National Sport Festival in Edo State. We are also planning to vaccinate all intending pilgrims from the state.’’ The National Primary Health Care Development Agency has also corroborated the claim by the state, saying the state is among the states with the highest number of vaccinated people against the COVID-19 virus.
