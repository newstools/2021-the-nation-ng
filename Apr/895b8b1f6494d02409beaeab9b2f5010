Some domestic airlines are yet to resume catering service despite the directive given by the Federal Government. Catering services were suspended last year during the outbreak of COVID-19 as part of measures to curb the spread of the virus. The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika on 22nd March 2021 announced the immediate resumption of catering services on domestic and international flights. Sirika explained the decision was taken in consideration of the businesses that have been adversely affected by the suspension and comfort of passengers. He however said the processes and procedures for the resumption of the services would be revealed by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), which will be in line with international practices. Three weeks after the announcement, The Nation observed that some airlines are yet to resume catering services. Director-General of Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Captain Musa Nuhu, said the authorities cannot force the airlines to commence catering services. He said: “You have to ask the airlines why they are not giving passengers refreshments, I don’t run the airlines. The airlines are private businesses, they offer the services they wish to offer. They wanted us to lift restrictions and we have done that, so it is left to the airlines to resume services. “I cannot tell you why the airlines are not complying. It is only the airlines that can answer that question.” On whether the airlines can be sanctioned for disobeying the directive by Federal Government, he said: “They are private businesses, we cannot force them to do what they are not ready to do. “It is not a regulatory matter, it is part of the service by the airlines, we can encourage them but we cannot force them.”
