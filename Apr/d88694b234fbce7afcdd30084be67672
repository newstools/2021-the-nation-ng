 A review of the monthly reports of the pension operators has shown that 5.1 million Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders had incomplete documentation as at the end of last year. The National Pension Commission in a report indicated that the engagement of agents to conduct data recapture for the Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) was expected to address the issue of incomplete documentation and validate relevant documents under the profile of RSA holders. Similarly, the commission said un-credited pension contributions is another notable outcome of the monthly reports review. These are the un-credited pension contributions domiciled in the Contribution Reconciliation Accounts (CRAs) and the Transitional Contributory Funds (TCFs) of the pension operators. The Commission, however, mandated the pension operators to ensure the resolution of outstanding un-credited contributions and file progress reports at regular intervals. There was also another issue of unfunded RSAs. The commission said: “Similarly, the monthly reports indicated that a total of 3.5 million RSAs had remained unfunded as at the end of 2020. “A majority of these unfunded accounts belong to employees of state governments and private sector organisations.”  The commission further stated that the status of commitments from 2019 routine examinations shows that as at end of last year, a total of 625 commitments had been complied with by the operators out of the 749 remedial actions recommended by the Commission to address identified inadequacies in their operations arising from the 2019 routine examinations it conducted.
