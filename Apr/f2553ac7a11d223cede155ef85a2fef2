The Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) has said it will hold a nationwide protest on Monday, April 19. It vowed to continue its nationwide strike until the Federal Government and Governors comply with its demands. The union had on April 6 shut all courts across the country in protest over non-implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary. In a circular released on Friday, JUSUN Deputy General Secretary, Mr P. Nnamani, said the strike will continue and that the judiciary workers will hold a nationwide protest on April 19. He said: “Pleased to inform you that the comrade president of the union, Marwan Mustapha Adamu, is full of appreciation to the spirit of comradeship and solidarity exhibited in this ongoing industrial action. “You are by this notice informed that the industrial action continues as the federal government and the governors are yet to find the grounds of meeting with our demands. “We are aware of threats and pressure that may come from the governors but please be resolute “Further be informed that following an emergency meeting of the NWC on the 15th April 2021, it is agreed that the union would organize a peaceful protest in the federal capital, which would be replicated in the 36 state capitals in furtherance of our agitations, from 19 April, 2021. “Please note that if in case, there are any invitations for negotiations/talks, you should promptly inform the national headquarters for guidelines and representations to avoid disorder in presentation of facts.”
