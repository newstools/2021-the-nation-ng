Actor and filmmaker, Lateef Adedimeji, also known as the “Crying machine” has opened up on what transpired between him and a fan who slapped him sometimes in the past. While speaking in an interview, the actor revealed the fan slapped him out of excitement, but he could not do anything but to thank her. “Out of excitement, a fan suddenly gave me a ‘hot’ slap. She said, ‘Oh my God! Lateef Adedimeji,” he began. The award-winning actor added: “I moved back in anger and saw her smiling. I just had to say ‘thank you. I had smile by force, by fire. Things like that happen. We just have to manage them because they are out of love. We cannot push them away.” Adedimeji also stated he always made sure not to mix his personal life and career. He said: “It has not been easy staying out of drama because as actors, we lead two lives. Our lives on movie sets are quite different from our lives as normal people. “However, a lot of our fans don’t even understand that. They mix up the two. I like to keep my things private and do things on my own. When it’s time for the public to know what I am doing, they will surely know. It has not been easy but I am someone who likes to be careful. “However, despite my carefulness, I still have to go through a lot of things. To an extent, I have been managing things with God on my side.” The multitalented actor, who is noted for speaking Yoruba with an Igbo accent in some films, said he started doing that to stand out from other actors.
