Singer, songwriter and performing artiste Tobechukwu Victor Okoh, popularly known as Peruzzi, has disclosed how he was duped of N400, 000 Davido sent to him. The R&B singer, who rose to prominence after being featured by music legend 2Baba on a song called ‘Amaka’, disclosed this in an interview with Chude Jideonwo. Peruzzi revealed award-winning singer, Davido had asked him to come to Dubai but he said he did not possess a passport at the time. He added Davido got someone to take care of that and asked him to send his account details so he could forward money for his tickets. However, the sensational artist revealed he had no account of his own so he decided to use that of the Uber driver whose service he employed only for the man to switch off his phone after receiving the funds and absconded with the money. He further revealed he searched for the Uber driver tirelessly but could not find him anywhere. Meanwhile, he related the development to the DMW boss who graciously asked him to send another account details, adding the details must be a genuine one which he was sure of. Davido, according to Peruzzi, eventually sent the funds again and he was able to jet off to Dubai.
