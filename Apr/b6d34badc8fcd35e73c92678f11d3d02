 A meeting between the Federal Government and striking resident doctors scheduled for today has been put off. The government explained that this was to give room for the Federal Ministry of Health, Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria and other relevant agencies to complete the assignments given at last week’s meeting. Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige yesterday said the meeting with the leadership of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) would be rescheduled. Ngige said: “The meeting is not holding tomorrow. We are waiting for the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) to give us the green light.  “The assignments assigned to different agencies, MDCN, committee of Vice-Chancellors have been completed and the list of House Officers transmitted to the Accountant General’s Office. “The government side is expected to complete all their assignments Monday and Tuesday. They will tell me what they have done tomorrow (today) and the FMoH will then call for a meeting. The meeting will hold whenever the FMoH is ready.”
