Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde on Wednesday urged the Southwest Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to brace up for the challenge of governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun states According to the electoral commission, elections will hold in the two states next year. Currently, Oyo is the only PDP state in the Southwest. Makinde said party faithful should gird their lonis for the polls in the two states. He said: “Those states – Osun and Ekiti – will hold elections next year and it is a must-win election for us. For me, I stand before you the newly inaugurated zonal executive committee for PDP Southwest, that I will support you. “We still have quite a bit to chew through, but I don’t have any doubt that with the quality of people that we have in this zonal exco and the quality of representation that we will be having at the national executive committee of our party, the Southwest has found its voice.” Makinde also said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would not be in power beyond 2023. The governor said Nigerians are tired of the APC-led Federal Government, stressing that it has not met their expectations. Makinde spoke at the inauguration of the Southwest Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Zonal Executive Committee, led by Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja. The ceremony was held at the Government House, Agodi Ibadan. Arapaja, former Oyo State deputy governor, defeated Dr. Eddy Olafeso during the zonal chairmanship contest held in Osogbo, Osun State capital. The ceremony was boycotted by supporters of former Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose.
