Athletic Bilbao who lost the 2020 final to Real Sociedad earlier this month, have won this competition on 23 occasions, while Barcelona have lifted the famous trophy 30 times throughout their history. Athletic played the final of the 2019-20 Copa del Rey earlier this month, with the fixture rearranged from last year due to the coronavirus outbreak; Mikel Oyarzabal’s second-half penalty ultimately decided the contest, but Marcelino’s team will have another chance to win the trophy tonight. Athletic last faced Barca in the 2014-15 final, suffering a 3-1 loss at Camp Nou, while they also took on the Catalan outfit in the final of the 2011-12 and 2008-09 tournaments.  Marcelino’s side have had a relatively straightforward route to this year’s final, but they did need extra time to overcome Levante in the semi-finals, with the second leg taking place at the start of March. Athletic are without a victory in their last six matches in all competitions, including draws in each of their last four La Liga matches, last sharing the points at home to Alaves on April 10. Los Leones are currently 11th  in Spain’s top flight and have endured a slump after a strong start under newly-appointed manager Marcelino but will certainly have their eyes on a top-10 finish as they are level on points with Celta Vigo directly above them.
