Julian Nagelsmann will take over as Bayern Munich coach from next season to replace Hansi Flick, the reigning German champions  has announced. Nagelsmann, who is just 33, will move from RB Leipzig on a five-year contract after Flick, whose relationship with the club’s powerful sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has deteriorated over transfer policy, asked to be released from his contract. According to widespread reports in Germany, Bayern will pay significant compensation to Leipzig of up to 25 million euros ($30.2m) for Nagelsmann, whose contract at the Red Bull-backed club was due to run until 2023. “I am convinced that Bayern’s sporting future will be a very successful one with Julian Nagelsmann,” Oliver Kahn, the club’s former goalkeeper who will succeed Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as Bayern chairman next year, told the club’s website. Nagelsmann has never hidden his desire to coach Bayern, especially as he comes from the Bavaria region. Last season, he led Leipzig to the semi-finals of the Champions League as well as third place in the Bundesliga, and this season his side has replaced Borussia Dortmund as Bayern’s main title challengers. With three games of the season remaining, Leipzig are the only team who can still prevent Bayern from winning a ninth consecutive Bundesliga title, although they sit seven points off the pace. Hansi Flick had fallen out with Bayern’s sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic over transfers Bayern will get another chance to wrap up the title for a record-extending 30th time in the Bundesliga era when they host Borussia Moenchengladbach next weekend.
