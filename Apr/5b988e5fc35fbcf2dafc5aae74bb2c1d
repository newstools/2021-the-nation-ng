Delta Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has assured the current repositioning of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will enable it win the 2023 presidential election. Okowa spoke during the PDP flagged off campaign rally for April 10 House of Assembly bye- election for Isoko North LGA. He noted that Nigerians have gone through untold hardship since the PDP left the centre in 2015, stressing all issues confronting the nation would be a thing of the past by the time the party reclaims political power in 2023. He said there was need for residents of Isoko North to vote massively for the PDP candidate in the forthcoming bye election, Mr. Jude Ogbimi to enable him occupy the gap created by the demise of Hon. Tim Owhefere. He said: “We are building the party ( PDP), from the grassroots to enable us take over the government at the centre (Abuja) in 2023.” He explained the massive road construction, appointment of Isoko North people into key position and the upgrade of the Ozoro Polytechnic to a full fledged university of Science and Technology were clear attestations of his love for the Isoko people. Presenting the party’s flag to the candidate, PDP Delta chairman, Kingsley Esiso, charged members to work as a team to ensure the party emerges victorious in the bye election.
