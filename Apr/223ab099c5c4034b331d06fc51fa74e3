Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has warned against vandalising public property, as those who are engaged in such acts will be fished out and punished. Lalong stated this on Saturday while inspecting a breached water pipe along Rayfield -Bukuru road. The governor, who expressed anger over the waste of water due to the activities of persons cutting corners to tap from public water supply lines, said such action was not only selfish and criminal, but capable of denying many citizens portable water. He, however, directed the Commissioner of Water Resources and GM Water Board to immediately investigate those behind the pipe breach and ensure that they bear the cost of the repairs in addition to facing prosecution.
