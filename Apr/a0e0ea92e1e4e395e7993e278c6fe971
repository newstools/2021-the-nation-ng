At least 10 persons have died and 400 hospitalised after drinking expired citric acid powdered drinks in Kano state. Among those hospitalised are 50 patients who are undergoing kidney related treatment, because of complications arising from consumption of the killer drinks, Kano State Commissioner for Health Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyawa said on Thursday. Speaking in a short video he said the affected persons were being treated in government hospitals. “As you are aware, the Ministry of Health had in the recent past announced the outbreak of a strange disease traceable to the consumption of substandard juices,” Tsanyawa said. “The consumption of these fake or substandard products have telling effects on the kidney, and vital organs of the body.” The State Consumer Protection Council has been investigating the incident, conducting searches in Kano markets and making seizures. It was gathered the batches of some of the products show that the drinks had expired over a year ago.
