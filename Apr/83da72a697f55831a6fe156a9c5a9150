Terem Moffi’s scintillating first season in France’s top division has sent many tongues wagging and former Nigeria Under- 17 coach Emmanuel Amuneke has joined the bandwagon excited by his present form. The Nigerian striker scored his 11th  and 12th  league goal of the season as French league one side Lorient lost to Olympique Marseille at the Stade Orange Velodrome on Saturday. Moffi played for the Golden Eaglets in 2015 under the tutelage of Amuneke and narrowly  missed  out of  the FIFA World-Cup winning squad in Chile. “I am happy for him  and I hope he can achieve all he wishes for in the game. I have been following his progress for some time now,” the former Barcelona winger told NationSports.”He is among the top Nigeria strikers at the moment alongside the likes of Victor Osimhen and Paul Onuachu and is in the list of players that I have seen that would be relevant for the Super Eagles in the coming years.” The former Tanzania national team manager also expressed his delight seeing some of his fledglings  light up the different leagues they ply their trade, becoming key players for their teams. Samuel Chukwueze, Kelechi Iheanacho and Victor Osimhen are some of the present crop of young stars that at one point in their budding  careers played under the former Zamalek star. “It gives me joy to see these players developing and growing,” Amuneke said. “It is very important that we have these players that we develop doing very well and becoming key players in their various teams.” “I think it shows that the future of the game is bright and everything depends on how we manage these young talents to get the best out of them,” he added.
