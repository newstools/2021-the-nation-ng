The Kano/Jigawa Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) at the weekend said its personnel arrested two suspected smugglers and seized contraband goods worth Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N38.5 million. A total of 26 seizures, including foreign rice, used clothes, spaghetti, milk, foreign soap and used tyres, were made. The Comptroller, Suleiman Pai Umar, who briefed reporters on the activities of the Command from January to March this year, said the zero tolerance for smuggling is non-negotiable noting he will not relent in the arrest and seizure of smuggled goods. Within the three months, the Customs also generated N7.6 billion as Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) against the N3.8 billion recorded within same period in 2020, the comptroller said. Customs said the figure (revenue) represents 100 percent increment in duty collection when compared to the first quarter of last year, which stood at N3.9 billion. The difference recorded, Umar said, was made possible because of robust stakeholders’ engagement, officers resolute in discharging their duties and an increased level of compliance in the traders’ zone. “It is very unfortunate and disturbing that despite the wide awareness on the consequences of smuggling activities on economic growth and development, some citizens still perpetuate this criminal act because of their selfish interest. “Overtime, the Kano/Jigawa Area Command has been tackling the incessant activities of smugglers within our territories/borders -an activity which has been affecting the nation’s economy and a major contributor to our current insecurity. We will not relent in intensifying our efforts to curbing this menace,” he said.
