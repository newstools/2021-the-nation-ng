Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi said he is “very proud” of his compatriot Kelechi Iheanacho’s scoring feat after he grabbed a goal in their 3-0 win over West Bromwich Albion. Iheanacho’s 36th-minute strike wrapped up the Foxes’ victory at the King Power Stadium following Johnny Evans and Jamie Vardy’s goals. The effort made it 16 goals for the Super Eagles striker across all competitions this season, including nine Premier League goals – a new personal record. In his reaction, Ndidi – who played from start to finish alongside Iheanacho on Thursday night – said the 24-year-old is full of confidence and belief in himself at the moment. “He just can’t stop scoring at the moment, so I’m very happy for him,” Ndidi told LCFC TV. “Very proud. I just want him to keep doing the things and keep scoring to help the team, so it is good for us. “The gaffer also speaks to us about being confident with the ball and being confident about our play. “It’s just one of those things where you, as a player, you just need to believe in yourself and I see it in him now. He really believes in himself now and the confidence is there.”
