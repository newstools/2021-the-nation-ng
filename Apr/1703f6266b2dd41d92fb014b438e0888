Cesar Azpilicueta believes should have scored more against Real Madrid on Tuesday. The first leg of the Champions League semi-final ended in a 1-1 after goals from Christian Pulisic and Karim Benzema. Blues captain Azpilicueta told BT Sport: “We started really well. We got the goal. We could have scored more. They came back from a set play and we suffered for a bit. “We knew playing a semi-final against Real Madrid was going to be tough. “We knew we had to perform at our best level. We started with courage, we pressed well and recovered the ball a lot of times but we missed that last pass or where we could choose the right option. “The [Chelsea] goal was a great finish with great composure. [Pulisic] is an amazing player. [Real’s] goal was great. [Benzema] is a great striker. We have to beware next Wednesday.” Sportinglife.ng
