A pan-Igbo think-tank, Nzuko Umunna, said yesterday that the late Afenifere spokesman, Yinka Odumakin, would be missed for his role in strengthening the bond between the Southeast and the Southwest. Chairman of Board of Trustees Prof. Pat Utomi led a delegation of Igbo and Yoruba leaders, including former minister Modupe Adelaja on a condolence visit to the families of Messrs Yinka Odumakin and Innocent Chukwuma. Utomi said Odumakin played a pivotal role as one of the facilitators of the “Handshake Across the Niger” conference, an initiative of Nzuko Umunna, which was hosted by Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Afenifere. He said the late Odumakin was “instrumental in rekindling the bond of brotherhood between Ndigbo and their Yoruba brethren,” adding that this would go down in history as one of his many laudable contributions to peace-building and national development. Utomi said the late Chukwuma was a towering figure in Nigeria’s human rights community, adding that his exploits, especially during the volatile military era, would remain indelible in the annals of Nigeria’s history. He prayed for the repose of the souls of the departed activists. The delegation was received by the spouses of the deceased. Members of the delegation included Senator Chris Anyanwu, Lady Onyeka Onwenu, Amb. Folake Marcus-Bello, Pastor Paul Bankole, Mr. Chido Nwakanma, Mr. Greg Muonyililo and Mr. Pat Okoye.
