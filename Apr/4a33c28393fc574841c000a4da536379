A 31-year lady, Titilayo Kudaisi and her boyfriend, Oluseyi Akinsete, have been arrested for allegedly stealing and selling children. They were arrested in Ondo State after allegedly stealing a six-month-old baby at Odo-Ota Sawmill area in Ilorin, Kwara State. Titilayo said they stole the child after the parents left the house while the boyfriend stood guard. She confessed that two children they earlier stole were sold in Imo State for N500,000 and N300,000. Titilayo said she also sold her own baby shortly after she was introduced to the business by her boyfriend. “We went to steal the child from his parents’ house in Ilorin, Kwara State,” she said. “It’s my boyfriend who’s aware of the movement of the boy’s mother. After surveying the environment, we moved in to steal the toddler. “I met my boyfriend who lured me into the business in Lagos where I was living. He invited me to Ilorin, and I went to meet him with my only child who’s three-years-old. “After arriving in Ilorin, he convinced me that we should sell my baby, a boy. I disagreed but after much persuasion, I agreed that we should sell the baby. We later sold my child to someone in Imo State for N300,000. “After selling my child we went to steal the baby at Ilorin, after which we travelled to Ondo town in Ondo State.” Her boyfriend said he stole three babies. Ondo Police Commissioner, Bolaji Salami said both suspects would soon be charged to court.
