Some hunters in Ogun State have surprisingly stumbled on a kidnap syndicate who were in the bush plotting to attack members of the public plying the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The kidnap suspects were sighted at the Fidiwo in the Ogun stretch of the expressway by the hunters who alerted the police. The suspects, Nathaniel Jacob, 24, from Nasarawa State, Isah Danladi, 22, from Kogi and Abubakar Rabiu, 23, from Niger, were arrested at Fidiwo area  following the tip-off from the hunters. Police spokesman  Abimbola Oyeyemi in a release, said the suspects were arrested on April  8 while others escaped. Abimbola said the suspects until their arrest, were  terrorising commutters along Lagos/Ibadan Expressway. He explained that hunters sighted them in the bush where they were planning  how to strike along the expressway and alerted the police. “The hunters sighted the suspects and quickly alerted the police, who rallied other stakeholders such as the hunters and stormed the Fidiwo Alapako bush. “On sighting the police, the suspects took to their heels in the bush, but luck ran out on the three and they were apprehended, while three others escaped with their arms. “On interrogation, the suspects confessed to being in the bush for the past 10 days, waiting for a convenient opportunity to strike. It took them that long because of the heavy presence of policemen on the strech of the expressway,” Abimbola said.
