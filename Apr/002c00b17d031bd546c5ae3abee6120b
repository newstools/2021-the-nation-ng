Two Italian Serie A clubs are battling to sign Nigeria international Simeon Tochukwu Nwankwo. Italian tabloid Tutto Udinese has confirmed that Udinese are interested in the Crotone marksman but face competition from Genoa. Nwankwo is likely to move on to pastures new in the summer if Crotone are relegated at the end of the 2020-2021 season. With eight matches to go before the end of this campaign, The Sharks find themselves in relegation trouble, having taken 15 points from thirty matches.  The Super Eagle has already put himself in the shop window with 16 goals to his name – becoming the highest scoring Nigerian in a single-season in the Serie A. Simy is Crotone’s all-time top scorer with 62 goals from 151 appearances in all competitions since joining the club five years ago. His contract with Crotone runs out on June 30, 2022.
