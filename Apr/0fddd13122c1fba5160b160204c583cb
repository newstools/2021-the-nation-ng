The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, has commissioned a house he built for one of his wives, Queen Omowunmi. The Queen wrote on Instragram: â€œWith greatest respect and honor, I would like to appreciate my husband, the father of my children for all He has been doing. I cannot thank him enough, he has been very supportive and I pray God Almighty grant him good health so as to be able to do more and more.
