 Instagram sensation, Adebowale ‘Mr Macaroni’ Adebayo, has opened up about his experience at the Adeniji Police station after his arrest during the Endsars protest in a series of tweets. The actor disclosed why he would never promote the Nigeria Police whom he described as oppressors of the people. Macaroni said the police threatened to kill him if he wasn’t a popular person. “I should promote the same police institution that oppresses Nigerians? When I was at Adeniji police station, the police officers took turns to beat me up. They were even calling themselves to come and beat Mr Macaroni. They said in my life when next I hear the police, I will run! One said if not that people would ask about me, he would have killed me,“ said Mr Macaroni.  He further said his experience at the station made him decide to always use his platform to expose the police. “That very day, I swore never to stop using my platform to call out the evil that the Police do. If they can do that to someone people know, imagine what they do to hundreds of thousands of unknown Nigerians. We are in court though. We filed last month. Aluta Continua. It’s interesting to see some government officials and supporters talk about love and compassion. The same people mocked me when the police brutalised me. They enjoyed my torture. They believe I am their enemy and so I deserve every hate and cruelty that I get. History will judge us all”
