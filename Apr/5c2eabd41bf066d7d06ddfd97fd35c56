Paris Saint-Germain ‘has issued Neymar with an ultimatum to sign his contract extension within two weeks’ as they fear he could return to Barcelona. The Brazilian star’s contract expires in the summer of 2022 and PSG tabled a renewal offer for the 29-year-old some time ago. It remains unsigned and, with the business end of the season approaching and Mauricio Pochettino’s team facing a Champions League semi-final with Manchester City, PSG want to hurry Neymar along. The news makes headlines on the front cover of Spanish newspaper Diario Sport, pointing out that if Neymar signs the extension until 2027, all talk over a return to the Nou Camp would be finished.  French paper L’Equipe earlier reported that PSG have become increasingly nervous and are now pressuring Neymar to put pen to paper before the first leg against City on April 28. With that two-legged tie to come, plus an interesting finish in Ligue 1 where PSG trail leaders Lille by three points with six matches to play, the club want to eliminate all distractions. But it has been reported that as long as there remains the possibility of interest from Barcelona, where Neymar played between 2013 and 2017, he will delay.
