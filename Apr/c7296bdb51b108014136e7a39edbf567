Lil Wayne has sparked rumors that he married on-again, off-again girlfriend Denise Bidot when he tweeted on Tuesday about “our forever.” “Happiest man alive! Today is the beginning of our forever,” the 38-year-old tweeted. “Forever?? Forever, ever?? FOREVER EVER!!!!! The Carters.” Prior to the new marriage rumors, Wayne, 38, and Bidot were reported to have broken up in the fall over his support of President Donald Trump. Following the split, Wayne hinted the 34-year-old model couldn’t handle being with someone so intense. Weezy however did not say who he married, but he’s been in an on-again, off-again relationship with Denise Bidot for the past year. Just last week, the rapper shared a video of the model on the beach writing their names in the sand. The romantic clip was accompanied by an unreleased song from the Young Money boss, “Let’s spell our names in the sand and draw a heart around it.” The couple, who started dating in April 2020, often showed PDA on social media. “You’re my best friend, my lover, and way more than a dream come true,” Bidot wrote while celebrating Wayne’s birthday in September. This is would be the second marriage for Weezy, who was previously married to his high school sweetheart Toya Johnson from 2004-2006. They share a 21-year-old daughter, Reginae. Wayne also has three sons from previous relationships.
