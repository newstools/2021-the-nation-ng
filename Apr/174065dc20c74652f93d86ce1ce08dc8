Two of Nigeria’s top elite road race runners Adamu Muazu and Williams Kefas have assured it would no longer be business as usual for the East Africans; especially Kenyans at this year’s Access Bank Lagos City Marathon. Unlike in the women’s category where a Nigerian has actually broken into the ranks to finish among the top 10, the men have never been that lucky. Iliya Pam in 2019 came the closest in breaking into the top 10 but his winning time of 2:32:24 in the Nigeria category was only good for 15th position overall. Ahead of the 2021 edition of the Lagos Marathon, Kefas is upbeat ahead of the big race:“This marathon, I am very ready to achieve a lot ; I have been training so hard for it and at the moment, my wife even said she cannot understand me again because all I do now is train, train and train every time. ” I am looking for my best, I really want to enter the top 10. We want to get a time that will make the AFN see that we the long-distance runners have been training hard.” The sixth edition of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon taking place on Saturday with only 300 elite runners on parade.
