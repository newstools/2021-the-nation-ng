Bandits have reportedly killed over 40 villagers in Magami community of Gusau local government area in Zamfara. The Nation gathered the attack occurred on Wednesday around 7:20am with bandits invading Yan Doka, Kango and Ruwan Dawa communities on over 90 motor bikes. The attack was the fourth in the last two weeks on the communities. Some of the villagers from the invaded communities, according to sources, escaped and trekked many kilometers to safety. “Many people were killed and buried in our village and presently there are still many in the bushes whose corpses have not been taken for burial due to fear of being re- attacked by the bandits. I witnessed the burial of many dead persons in Ruwan Dawa village too” “Many bodies are currently lying at Magami hospital while many injured persons were being attended by health staff at the same venue,” an eyewitness told our correspondent. An airforce fighter jet was said to have hovered above the bandits and unleashed missiles, which didn’t not deter them from the attack. Many villagers from the affected communities took refuge in Magami town as their dwelling places were razed. Zamfara Police Public Relation Officer, SP Shehu Mohammed, said the Command was yet to receive briefs on the attack when contacted.
