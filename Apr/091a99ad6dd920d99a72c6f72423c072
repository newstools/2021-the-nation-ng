He said Buhari approved the upgrading of another nine forest reserves across the country out of the 23 earlier requested. According to Goni, Nasarawa State government, in 2013, alongside other 22 states, requested for upgrading of the Marhai forest reserve, following which President Buhari approved the upgrading of ten forest reserves. Sule thanked Buhari for approving recommendation of the NPS establishing the ten new national parks.
