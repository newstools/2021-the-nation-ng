No fewer than 50,000 Tiv farmers in about 13 village settlements have been displaced from their ancestral homes in Nasarawa State. The displaced village settlements are: Dooshima, Antsa, Dooka, Angwan Yara, Ikyayior, Targema, Tse Tor, Chia, Umurayi, Dooga, Gindan Rail, Ajikamaka and Ankoma all in Ekye development area, Doma South in Doma local government area of Nasarawa State. They were displaced by rampaging herdsmen and camped taking refuge in Kardoroko in Keana LGA and Agyaragu in LGA of Nasarawa State. Others are taking refuge with relations and friends in Kardoroko and Agyaragu while others are proceeding to Daudu, Guma local government area of Nasarawa State. Addressing the displaced persons in Kardoroko and Agyaragu, the Senior Special Assistant to Nasarawa Governor on conflict resolution, Engr Moses Utondu, appealed to them to remain calm as Governor Abdullahi Sule is a man of peace and will immediately look into their problem. He assured he will report their plights to the Governor and expressed hope the government of Nasarawa will restore normalcy returned to the affected communities. “My assessment so far has shown that our people are truly displaced, it is not an issue of speculations but my courage and comfort is that our governor is somebody who is committed to peace. “We are here to see things ourselves and we are going to report back to the governor and he will take prompt action,” he said Utondu blamed the crisis on the implementation of the anti-open grazing law in Benue State, which is having adverse effects on the indigenous Tiv farmers in Nasarawa living on the borderlines.
