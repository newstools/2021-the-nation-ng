 After a long battle with ill health and recuperating, famous comic actor Babatunde ‘Baba Suwe’ Omidina has made a rebound and he’s back on movie sets. The 62-year-old actor was hired to play a role in Yomi Fabiyi’s latest flick, ‘Oba Shomolu’. Not physically fit like yesteryears, Baba Suwe still finds a way to crack the ribs of young actors who ushered him to the movie set while relying on Fabiyi’s grips to maintain his balance. Some of the actors on the same set with Baba Suwe include Mustapha Sholagbade, Tayo Amokade aka Ijebu, and Fuji singer Alao Malaika. Baba Suwe said he chose to act in the movie to shame naysayers and rumour mongers wishing him dead. The news got many of his fans apprehensive and they took to social media in droves to inquire about the health and whereabouts of the comic star. The rumour filtered away when friends and colleagues visited his home to celebrate his birthday.  “My name remains the same, Babatunde Omidina aka Ayinla Ade, Baba Suwe, Omi o se tanikoko, onipari eshin,” he jokingly introduced himself on the movie set. Continuing he said, “I am alive, hale and hearty. I am live on the set of a movie, ‘Oba Shomolu’ produced by my son, Yomi Fabiyi. Yomi is a son to me. if not for him, I’ll not be at this film location. People know that I am sick but by the grace of God, I’m getting better and stronger ‘kokoko bi ota’ (Strong like mortal). I’m not dead. It’s just an illness and it has gone to where it comes from. So, I’m fully back to work and I will live long in life.” The actor also hinted that he will be featured in another movie entitled ‘Abete’ produced by Taiwo Oni and directed by Yomi Fabiyi.
