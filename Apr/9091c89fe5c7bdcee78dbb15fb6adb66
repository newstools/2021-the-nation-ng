LEICESTER City striker Kelechi Iheanacho’s brilliant form in March has seen him named the Premier League’s EA SPORTS Player of the Month. The Nigeria international scored five goals in March, including the equaliser against Brighton & Hove Albion, a stunning volley away at Burnley, which was in contention for the Budweiser Goal of the Month award, and a hat-trick in City’s 5-0 win against Sheffield United at King Power Stadium. He was one of eight players shortlisted for the award and beat the likes of Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane, Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez and Manchester United’s Luke Shaw to the accolade. Iheanacho said: “I’m so pleased and honoured to win this award. It’s great to be recognised, but I couldn’t have done it without the support of my team-mates and the manager. “I’m really enjoying playing at the minute and hopefully I can push on and help the team to finish as high as possible this season.”
