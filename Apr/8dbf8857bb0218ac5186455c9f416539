 Mavin Records boss Don Jazzy has urged Nigerians to follow more Nigerian celebrities than their foreign counterparts on social media platforms. Don Jazzy made the call via his Instagram page in one of his recent live shows. The music producer stated that it feels awkward seeing Nigerians following foreign celebrities more than the local ones. Don Jazzy lamented at how some pride themselves as lovers of foreigners. “I feel some type of way when I’m going through a Nigerian page and I see that we are not supporting our celebrities. When I see that you’re not following a Tiwa Savage, Chima Amanda, Genevieve, Olamide, Wizkid, or Davido but you’re following Kim Kardashian, Lori Harvey I feel like you’re not patriotic” Don Jazzy said.  “Some will be like I don’t follow Nigerian celebrities with pride sef. This following of a thing no be say we dey pay for am o. I just feel like we can support more. Buy Nigeria grow the Naira. With the numbers we have, we can be having some interesting conversations globally if we get all the support we can get. I’m just saying sha. I come in peace”. Don Jazzy further said that he doesn’t get a follow back from certain celebrities too. “I’m following Burna, Genevieve, Bangalee and they are not following back too. Nobody dies. But as a proud Nigerian, I’m just doing it to show I’m proud of what they have achieved for the country. Plus to support in my little way.”
