All Progressives Congress (APC) National leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu yesterday paid a condolence visit to the party’s Chairman, Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni. The visit was over the death of the Yobe State Governor’s grandmother Hajiya Fatima Mallum Yuram. Hajiya Yuram died last week at the age of 102 years, a statement by the governor’s press and media director-general said. Tinubu, who visited the party Chairman in his Wuse Zone 2, Abuja residence, said the family will greatly miss the late Hajiya Yuram wisdom and prayers to the family. He described the demise of the late community leader as a great irreparable loss to Yobe State and the country at large. The one-time Lagos governor prayed Almighty Allah to grant her soul eternal rest and give the family the fortitude to bear the loss. Buni thanked Tinubu for finding the time to condole with him and his family.
