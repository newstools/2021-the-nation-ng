The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that life expectancy for people living in low-income countries is 16 years lower than for people in high-income countries. It also noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed between 119 and 124 million people into extreme poverty last year. Also, under-5 death rates among children from the poorest households had doubled that of children from the richest households. The WHO said the pandemic is estimated to have driven between 119 and 124 million more people into extreme poverty last year. It added that there is convincing evidence that it has widened gender gaps in employment, with women exiting the labour force in greater numbers than men over the past 12 months. It, therefore, urged governments to invest in strengthening their health systems and remove the barriers that prevent so many people from accessing them. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated these in a statement to commemorate this year’s World Health Day. He said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has thrived amid the inequalities in our societies and the gaps in our health systems. “It is vital for all governments to invest in strengthening their health services and to remove the barriers that prevent so many people from using them, so more people have the chance to live healthy lives. “Now is the time to invest in health as a motor of development. “We do not need to choose between improving public health, building sustainable societies, ensuring food security and adequate nutrition, tackling climate change and having thriving local economies. All these vital outcomes go hand in hand.” The United Nations’ agency noted that within countries, illness and death from COVID-19 have been higher among groups who face discrimination, poverty, social exclusion and adverse daily living and working conditions – including humanitarian crises
