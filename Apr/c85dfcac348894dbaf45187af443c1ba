The delay in completion of the Lagos-Ibadan railway project may not be unconnected with failure of the contractor to adhere to the project work plan, The Nation has learnt. Aside the contractors, trailer drivers at the Apapa station are also frustrating the project due to wrong parking. Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, disclosed these during the inspection of the Lagos-Ibadan rail project on Saturday at Moniya Station in Ibadan. The Minister said: “I have asked CCECC to see us on Wednesday, we will have a meeting and I have to tell them that I am sick and tired of their excuses. “We have noticed things that will delay movement of goods, they are minor, I believe them but I need them to reiterate that and TEAM has always said that they don’t go by their work plan. “Ibadan-Kano and other future projects, everybody must go by work plan both in terms of payment, construction, inspection and others so that we keep to the time and the plan of work.” On the disruption caused by trailer drivers at Apapa, he said: “We have asked the Permanent Secretary to call the NPA in because the trailer drivers have disrupted the movement of train into the seaport and we have to stop them now. we wither stop them or stop the owner of the terminal.” He also charged the contractors to engage more work force. He said: “I have noticed that the number of workforce has reduced which is affecting the speed of work. We had agreed that we will commission in April but we cannot.” On the likely date of commissioning, he said: “We are talking to the office of the President, when we talk with him, we will get a date and we will commission.” He also said the ministry would work with relevant agencies and departments to map out communities that may be affected by flooding as a result of the project. Amaechi also assured the inscription at the stations facilities written in Chinese language would be changed to Nigerian languages.
