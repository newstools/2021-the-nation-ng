 The Carabao Cup final at Wembley next month Will be played in front of 8,000 fans, the EFL has confirmed. The match, on 25 April, has now been confirmed as an official test event for the UK Government’s Events Research Programme. The final will be one of a number of sports events used to collect evidence and collate best practice for managing and mitigating transmission risk. The evidence will then be shared across the event economy so that venues can prepare to accommodate fuller crowds and audiences.  “Having worked extensively with relevant stakeholders, the EFL can confirm that a proportion of tickets will be made available to finalist clubs, meaning fans from each side will be able to cheer on their teams, marking a welcome return of club supporters to English football,” a statement said. “Further information on ticketing and club allocations will be announced separately in due course. “Remaining allocations of tickets will be for groups including local residents in Brent and similarly NHS staff, who will be offered tickets as a ‘thank-you’ for the incredible service that has been provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.” EFL chiefs also plan to dedicate the match on April 25 to the NHS, with both teams wearing ‘Thank You NHS’ badges on their shirts.
