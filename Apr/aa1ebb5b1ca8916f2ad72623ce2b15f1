Residents of Osborne Foreshore Two Estate yesterday denied attacking contractors working in the estate. They said there was also no plot to attack the Managing Director of Lekki Gardens Estate Limited, Richard Nyong or anyone else. Chairperson of the Osborne Foreshore Two Estate Residents Association, Mrs Chinwe Ezenwa Mbah, said reports of an attack (not by The Nation) were baseless. The association said its members would continue to be law-abiding despite provocations. It recalled that the residents woke up on April 7 to find heavy-duty construction trucks blocking the entrance and exit gates, the fourth time in six months that would happen. “Osbourne Foreshore residents, as law-abiding citizens, have never taken the law into their hands. “We have written many letters to report constant harassment to the Inspector General of Police as well as to the Lagos State Government. The residents are waiting for their cries to be heard by the relevant authorities,” the association said. The residents said they would continue to seek redress through every legal means. “We again use this medium to appeal to Lagos State Government to protect the interest of law-abiding residents and ensure full compliance to the building laws,” the association said.
