 FC Lorient striker Terem Moffi will soon take his game to a higher level, according to former Monaco and Lyon star Frederic Piquionne. Moffi, 21, has scored eight goals and provided two assists to give his modest French club a fighting chance to escape relegation from Ligue 1 this season. Piquionne said he believes Moffi is “an exceptional player” with a “very large margin of progress” and a profile of a striker much sought after by the big clubs. “Terem Moffi goes fast, shoots hard with both feet, he is good with his head, he has everything to be a very, very good player,” he told Le Telegramme.  “He’s a pure centre-forward, tough and tall (1.88 metres) and only 21. “His goals have been important for his team as they have allowed them to reverse the downward spiral they found themselves.” Piquionne said he expects the young striker to be more decisive inside the box and be a little more mobile. “He can be even more decisive in the goal area, by also being a little more mobile, but I do not want to give him any limits,” he said. “I hope he doesn’t give it away. He can go very, very high!”
