Kelechi Iheanacho should be a contender for the Premier League Player of the Season award. That is the view of talkSPORT host Adrian Durham, who insists the in-form striker has had a bigger impact for Leicester than Jesse Lingard at West Ham in recent months. Iheanacho has scored 12 goals in his last nine games in all competitions, while Lingard has netted nine times in 11 Premier League matches in a loan spell from Manchester United. And Durham insists there is no ‘standout’ Player of the Season contender, which means Iheanacho should be considered for the award. He told talkSPORT: “He is making a big difference at Leicester City.  “He’s making a bigger impact at Leicester right now than Lingard is at West Ham. Whether people like that or not, I don’t care. That’s the truth. That’s a fact. With [Jamie] Vardy not scoring, Iheanacho is keeping Leicester in the top four. Leicester are in the top four and West Ham are not, he’s having a bigger impact than Lingard. “They’re different players, they play in different position, I get it. But if people are talking about Lingard and saying how well he’s doing, and absolutely rightly so, and if they are putting him as a contender for Player of the Season, then they have to talk about Iheanacho in the same way.” “There is no obvious Player of the Season – there’s no real obvious standout smack you in the face Player of the Season, is there?”
