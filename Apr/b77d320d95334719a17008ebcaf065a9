 Governorship aspirant and Chief Executive Officer of Wichtech Industries, Chidozie Nwankwo has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) is well positioned to replace the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the November 6 election in Anambra State. He spoke with reporters about his desire to contest the governorship election in the state. Dr Nwankwo said the dream for the state has not been actualised by the APGA – led government. He said he is best positioned to win the coming election having earned the trust of the people of the state.  Nwankwo also said God asked him to contest the election on the platform of APC. He said: “We have not seen the dreams some of us in the business sector have for the state. It has not been actualised. We are coming out to make a difference. “Obiano has done his best as a governor. I would not say he didn’t try as a governor. If you look at some of us that are coming out to challenge APGA, there is no way any right-thinking human being will ever think that APGA will still be in government. “In the absence of people like us who are coming from the business environment, we have been tested and proven in creating wealth. What we need is to use our proven experience to run the state.” He further said that as much as Anambra is reputed to be a state with a very high concentration of intellectual talents, there is a need for the resources to be appropriately harnessed.
