Parents who have children in Lagos public primary schools have praised the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu for introducing the EkoEXCEL programme – an intervention to reposition primary education in the state. Eko Excellence in Child Education and Learning (EXCEL) is an educational transformation initiative aimed at bridging the gap in quality education delivery, through the use of technological devices such as tablets and smartphones. Mrs. Adebola Coker, whose child attends Ireti Girls’ Primary School, Ikoyi, said the enthusiasm of her daughter towards educational content had increased tremendously as well as her ability to easily grasp what she is taught in class. “I first noticed the changes about seven months ago.  Toyin is now more interested in studying. When she comes back from school, she is eager to do her home work with very little assistance. We no longer have to chase her around to get her homework done,” she said. Another father, Mr. Owolabi, said: “Primary education in Mushin had never experienced such a transformation and the results are evident in the lives of the pupils who attend the schools. My children are now more interested in going to school earlier than ever before.  They come back home singing and teaching us new words and they even construct better sentences. For us it is a great feeling to see the changes Eko EXCEL has brought to our government schools especially because we want the best for our children and we can’t afford private schools.” On his part, Sanwo-Olu described EkoEXCEL as a game changer in primary education. Speaking while receiving the Chairman, House Committee on Basic Education and Services, Prof. Julius Ihonvbere and members of the committee, he said: “In the last couple of years, we have built strong foundations and this fiscal year, we increased our budget on education from eight to twelve per cent. We invested in curriculum development through EKOEXCEL to change the learning outcomes from our schools.”
