Kylian Mbappe’s future has been plunged into doubt again amid his recent comments and reports that Paris Saint-Germain are growing ‘frustrated’ with the player. After months of speculation the 22-year-old forward had been widely expected to sign a new contract, with his current deal set to expire at the end of next season. But so far this has not come to fruition, with no recent progress made, and Mbappe appeared far from content with life in Ligue 1 in a recent interview he gave while away on international duty with France. When asked about the scrutiny he has received in the media recently, he replied: “Of course it gets tiring. Especially when you play for a club in your country and you give everything for your national team. After a while it gets tiring.  “It’s different for players who play abroad and only come back here for the national team. I’m there all the time, they speak about me a lot more. It’s a different context [to other players], but I knew it would be like that when I signed for Paris. We’ll see.” And according to French outlet Le Parisien, PSG chiefs Leonardo and Nasser Al-Khelaifi are getting fed up with the situation, and are considering lowering Mbappe’s asking price this summer in order to sell him now rather than risk losing him on a free next year. The likes of Liverpool and Real Madrid have been strongly linked with a move for the star in the past, but they are likely to have to pay a fee of between £102-128m if they are to tempt PSG to cash in.
