Cristiano Ronaldo returns to Serie A today  with Juventus looking to reboot their title defence against struggling city rivals Torino. Hopes of a 10th consecutive league title were rocked when Juventus fell 1-0 at home to lowly Benevento before the international break. Juventus are third, 10 points adrift of leaders Inter Milan, with both teams having 11 games left to play this season. Ronaldo returns from international duty where his fury at a winner ruled out against Serbia was followed by joy at scoring against Luxembourg. The Portuguese striker will play his sixth Turin derby, which could be his last, amid speculation of an exit from Turin at the end of the season.  The 36-year-old, Serie A’s top scorer this season, has scored three goals in his previous five derbies, but just once at Torino in his first season back in 2018. Just six points separate Juventus in third from seventh-placed Lazio in the race for elite European football. The pressure is on coach Andrea Pirlo with defensive duo Leonardo Bonucci and Merih Demiral both testing positive for COVID-19 after international duty.
