RAPPER Phyno has enlightened upcoming acts on the Nigerian music scene not to depend on just talents but also dream big. Phyno made this known during a chat with Bankuli via an Instagram video post. Phyno said “No matter how much you love an artist, if he doesn’t have the dream from within it is not going to work because it is like you dreaming for somebody so, the dream is actually what is going to take you far. I have worked with a whole lot of artists that you probably say they have talent but they don’t even see themselves at that place. So how is it going to work?. Continuing, the singer and songwriter said, “It has to be you, that is why when you hear people say you are in charge of your dreams, you are in charge of the future you have to make it work; it’s fact. Never stop dreaming. Success is in your hands”. Chibuzor Azubuike better known as Phyno is the founder of the Penthauze Music record label and has artists such as Superboycheque, Nuno and Rhatti signed to his label.
