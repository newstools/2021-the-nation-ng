Without the presence of corps members, the health and education sectors would have collapsed, Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim has said. Ibrahim said corps members posted to rural areas are holding the schools and hospitals in the country. The D-G spoke at the opening ceremony of the 2021 NYSC management’s meeting with representatives of state governments, FCT administration and local government councils in Abuja. Ibrahim appealed to Nigerians to shun conflicts and crisis and embrace unity for the sake of the country. Ibrahim said corps members would soon commence a sensitisation programme to enlighten Nigerians on the need to embrace unity. He said the essence of the meeting was to identify challenges affecting the scheme and chart ways to sort them out, stressing that every sector needs the presence of corps members. Ibrahim said: “Without the NYSC and corps members, the education and health systems would collapse. In the rural areas, they are the ones holding the schools and hospitals.” Appreciating state governments and other stakeholders for the impact they have made in upgrading the facilities in orientation camps among others, he also called on those who are yet to assist the scheme to rise up to their responsibilities. Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Muhammad Bello called on stakeholders to continue to support the scheme for the successful discharge of its mandate. Bello said the FCT administration would not relent in carrying out its responsibilities by upgrading the facilities of the FCT Camp in Kubwa through the provision of security and welfare for the corps members. Speaking through the Acting Secretary, Area Council Secretariat, Mrs Omolola Olanikpekun commended the corps members for their interventions in various sectors in the FCT.
