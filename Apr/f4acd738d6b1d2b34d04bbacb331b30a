 Troops and vigilantes yesterday pushed back some bandits who attacked Sarkin Pawa, headquarters of Munya local area of Niger State. The Nation gathered that the bandits in large numbers invaded the community about 1pm but vigilantes and Air Force personnel repelled them. Eyewitnesses told The Nation that the bandits killed one man and injured many others when they entered the town. The shootout reportedly lasted about an hour before the bandits fled. Police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun did not take calls to his phone.  The state government has urged residents to disregard a viral video of heavily armed gunmen purportedly moving into some parts of the state. The government made the call in a statement issued in Minna yesterday by Mallam Mohammed Idris, the Commissioner for Information and Strategy. “Our attention has been drawn to a viral video of heavily armed gunmen said to be at the entrance of a town purported to be Niger State territory, Nigeria, but discovered to be in faraway Chad. “The purported video is that of a terrorist group in Chad, but not anywhere in Nigeria. “We hasten to state categorically that the information is false as such thing did not happen anywhere in the state,” the statement said.
