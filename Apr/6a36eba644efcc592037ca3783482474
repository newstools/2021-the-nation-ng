 Nollywood actress who took up a fire fighting job, Grace Agbo, has said that her dream of helping people has been fulfilled in both careers. Agbo turned 30 recently and she said God has changed her life positively. Speaking in a chat, Agbo said the job of a firefighter has taught her to be disciplined, patient, courageous and observant. Agbo noted that as an actress, she helped to make people laugh while as a firefighter, she is involved in helping people. According to her, “I feel great. God has really done me well. My whole life has changed positively. I may not have it all but am grateful to God for everything I’ve achieved, my life is a great testimony. Both jobs have both been fulfilling in different ways. Growing up I always have the feeling of helping people and also making people happy. I have been able to do this through acting and firefighting.  As a firefighter, our mandate is to save and protect lives and properties, rescue victims during an emergency, extinguish, control, and prevent fire, as well as carry out other humanitarian works. Nothing else could be more fulfilling.” Continuing, she said: “Acting on the other hand has helped me put smiles on people’s faces. Most times I get calls from people telling me about movies I acted in, the role I played, and how it made them feel. Then I realised most people are happy whenever they watch my movie. Am a fulfilled woman.” Agbo has featured in several Nollywood movies such as Black Out, Mr. Potosky, Lost Pride, Deadly Desire, Palace of Sorrow, Ada-Ide-Ichaka, Haunted Palace, Village Don, The Calabash among others.
