There was palpable fear in Koka village in Obokun Local Government Area of Osun State after suspected herdsmen invaded the community to abduct villagers. It was gathered the armed herdsmen invaded the village around 11:50 pm on Sunday. A source in the village told The Nation the herdsmen stormed the village and started to forcefully pick villagers from homes randomly. According to him: “Those that attacked us were herdsmen, they were armed and threatening to kill anybody that dares them. “One of the villagers informed The Hunters Group of Nigeria on phone about the attack and they moved to our village. “When they arrived the village, those herdsmen started shooting at them. We were scared because of the open fire on the hunters. “When the herdsmen faced the hunters in a gun battle, the victims they abducted escaped the scene. The gun battles go on for minutes before the herdsmen ran away because some of the villagers also joined forces with hunters. “The operation was not successful because some of the herdsmen sustained injury and hunters also sustained injuries,” he said. Another source disclosed Police later moved to the village and went after the herdsmen. Osun Police Public Public Relation Officer, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the incident. She said: “Some hoodlums suspected to be herdsmen attacked Koka village and villagers and hunters moved against them. They engaged the hoodlums in a gun battle to liberate themselves. “Three hunters and hunters sustained bullet wounds. They have been taken to State Hospital, Asubiaro for treatment. “We have drafted our men to the area. The locals also joined the policemen to cordon off and search the area to arrest the fleeing culprits”.
