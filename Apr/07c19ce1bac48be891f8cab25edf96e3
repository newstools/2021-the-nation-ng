Kebbi State businessman Jimoh Abdulmumin has accused operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in the state of extorting N1,000,000 from him. Abdulmumin claimed the operatives  Inspectors Maigari Yarima, Isyaku and Jumada collected the money as bail after allegedly detaining him and his truck driver for three days without charge. Speaking to reporters in Birnin Kebbi, Abdulmumin, an Automated Gas Oil (AGO) distributor, said they were arrested while distributing the product to a customer at Jega  Local Government Area. He claimed that they were detained for three days without food at the command headquarters in Kebbi with his truck seized and parked at the Birnin Kebbi Eid prayer ground. The man said Yarima, who led the team, insisted he must pay N1,000,000 to bail himself and his driver. Abdulmumin alleged that the officers, led by one Inspector, threatened to lock them up should they fail to pay the money, despite having all legal documents covering his truck and the product. He said: “My truck was loaded with AGO, which is pure and legal with all  relevant documents. They kept me in their cell at their headquarters in Birnin Kebbi for three days. They kept threatening us with continued detention and we started begging to be released. “But Yarima insisted that he would not collect less than N1m from us because the State Commandant too will share from it..” “I am seeking the intervention of all relevant stakeholders and the Commandant-General of NSCDC for justice. I want justice,” he said. State Commandant Suleiman Ibrahim Marafa declined to comment on the phone, insisting on a physical meeting.
