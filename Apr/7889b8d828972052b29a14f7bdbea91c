THIS week’s edition of Glo-sponsored African Voices Changemakers will showcase two African sports legends who have distinguished themselves in the sport of Rugby. The 30-minute magazine programme will host the duo of Kenyan-born Humphrey Kayange and Tendai Mtawarira, who was born in Zimbabwe but later migrated to South Africa. At thirty-nine-years-old, Humphrey Kayange runs the Atlas Foundation which is a platform for mentoring and advocating for Kenyan athletes and young sports prospects in his country. Prior to his retirement, he was part of the historic Kenyan squad that reached the semi-finals of the Rugby World Cup Sevens, and was nominated for the International Rugby Board Sevens Player of The Year in 2009. Kayange distinguished himself during the 2008/2009 IRB world series and was awarded the Kenyan Presidential Order of Golden Warriors (OGW) alongside his brother who is equally an accomplished rugby player. He obtained a degree in Organic Chemistry from Jomo Kenyatta University, Juja, Kenya before professionally venturing into rugby. Also featuring in this episode is thirty-five-year-old, Tendai Mtawarira. He established ‘The Beast Foundation’ through which he builds a community of enthusiastic young people who aspire to find their feet in sports and education.
