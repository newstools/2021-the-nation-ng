Police in Ondo State have arrested one Emmanuel Akpan for allegedly killing his employer and stealing her N3,500, two phones, jewelries, and a generator. Akpan was said to have killed Mrs. Febisola Caroline Adedayo, an Ondo-based  food canteen operator, with a cutlass while she was sleeping. Akpan was allegedly recommended by one Goodness Akpan to the late  Adedayo because she had “lots of money”. Both of them fled to a village in Ogun State but were trailed by detectives and arrested. The suspect said during his parade yesterday that Goodness Akpan asked him to kill his madam but Goodness Akpan denied the allegation, saying he worked for late Adedayo for three years before introducing other workers to her. Police Commissioner Bolaji Salami said the suspects would be charged to court after investigation.
