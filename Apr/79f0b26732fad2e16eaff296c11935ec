An eyewitness, who narrowly escaped the attack, Mr Yakubu Bala, said the bandits began to shoot sporadically at the worshippers as they scampered for safety. According to him: “Dr. Zakariah Dogo Yaro, a medical Doctor with the Kaduna State Ministry of Health was shot dead and unspecified number of people kidnapped while so many worshipers sustained varying degrees of injuries. “As I am talking to you now, we have not seen some of our villagers who ran into the bushes while the shootings was going on. “We don’t know what is happening that we are facing this kind of scenario in our peaceful communities. “Most Villagers are already leaving their homes because of the constant attacks in so many Villages in Chikun local government.”
