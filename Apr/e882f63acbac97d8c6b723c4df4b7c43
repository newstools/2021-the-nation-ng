A Catholic Church priest Rev. Izu Marcel Onyeocha kidnapped on Saturday has been freed. His release was contained in a short statement issued by the Owerri provincial secretary of Claretian Missionaries, Rev. Fr. Matthew Iwuagwu on Monday. Also, police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu confirmed the development. Onyeocha, a professor of Philosophy at the Imo State University, is a priest in the congregation of Claretian Missionaries. He was kidnapped on Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway by suspected herdsmen, according to the police. Speaking with The Nation, Fr. Iwuagwu said Fr. Onyeocha was dropped off at the Ihube Community in Okigwe council area of the state early yesterday morning. He said the kidnappers apparently became frustrated that no one was willing to pay ransom for the release of the priest and quickly released him. The victim was said to have trekked to St. Mary’s Catholic Cathedral, Okigwe, from where he returned to his base.
