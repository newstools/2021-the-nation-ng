Jailbreak at the Correctional Centre, Ubiaja in Esan Southeast Local Government Area of Edo State has been foiled. The escape bid was foiled on Wednesday by personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Edo Command and other security agencies, spokesman of NSCDC Richard Ogbebor said yesterday. He said: “Edo State Command of NSCDC received a distress call and we quickly mobilised our personnel to the facility. “On getting to the correctional centre, it was discovered that the inmates had broken out from their cells and were already engaging the correctional officers in a fight. “In a bid to bring the development under control, some of correctional officers and NSCDC personnel sustained varying degrees of injury. “With the assistance of the 4 Brigade of Nigerian Army, Benin and Edo Command of Nigeria Police Force, the inmates were overpowered and taken back to their cells.” Ogbebor also urged Edo residents to always provide the command with useful information about criminals in their midst.
