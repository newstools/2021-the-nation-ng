Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) has commiserated with the Itsekiri people on the announcement of the passing of the Olu of Warri, Ogiame Ikenwoli. The Yoruba socio-political group, in a statement by its publicity secretary, Kunle Famoriyo, said the announcement, which was made at the recent Itsekiri General Assembly was a sad development. The group “therefore, entreats all Itsekiri people anywhere they are in the world to give the Olu a befitting rite of passage by ensuring the three-month passage rites is peaceful and solemn, according to traditions.” ARG also congratulated the new Olu-designate, Prince Utieyinoritsetsola Emiko, urging all itsekiri people and their brothers in Yorubaland to support the young monarch. He added: “We pray for the soon-to-be-crowned king for wisdom, charisma, and resources to pilot the affairs of the Itsekiri nation in accordance with the significance of his reign as the twenty-first Olu of Warri,” the statement said. “We assure the Itsekiri people of the brotherhood solidarity of Yoruba people, as charged by our revered Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II.”
