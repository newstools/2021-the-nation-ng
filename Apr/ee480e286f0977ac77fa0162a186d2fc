As part of measures to curb road traffic crashes, the Dangote Cement Plc has launched a drivers’ training centre located at the Dangote Cement Plant, in Obajana, Kogi State. The centre is charged with the responsibility of attending to all training needs of the Dangote Cement Plc’s drivers. The company, in a statement yesterday, quoted the Head of the Dangote Drivers Training Centre, Mr Harisson Pepple as saying that the training was in line with the company’s zero-tolerance policy for auto crashes. He added that the trainee drivers were drawn from the existing motor boys, and that the training period is six months. He said the idea for the new drivers’ training centre was conceived in June 2020, with the aim of training, retraining and constantly engaging the Dangote drivers. According to him, the company is collaborating with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in most of its activities, adding that the trainee drivers were also taught defensive driving technique which involves driving to save lives, time and property.
