A carwash man Kazeem Olanrewaju, who allegedly absconded in Lagos with a customerâ€™s Toyota Venza car, has been arrested by the police. The owner had left the car at a carwash for washing and went to a barbershop for a haircut. Before he returned, the suspect, who was in possession of the key, had bolted with the car. He was on his way to neighbouring Benin Republic with the car when the Divisional Police Officer, Idiroko division, Shadrach Oriloye on patrol with his men flagged him down on sighting the car without a number plate. The suspect reportedly attempted to escape but was chased and arrested. He was said to have admitted working with a carwash in Festac town Lagos State, and was given the car by a customer to wash, explaining that while the owner dashed to a nearby barbershop, he ran away with the car and later took off the number plate. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi said the case was reported at the Festac town police station, which has also been informed of the recovery of the car. The suspect will be handed over to the Lagos State Police Command after investigations.
