 The Chief Executive Officer, Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Sarki Auwalu, an engineer, has reiterated that the agency will align itself with the challenges identified by the Electricity Generating companies on the Nigeria Gas Transportation Network Code (NGTNC). He made this known in Abuja during the NGTNC engagement with the DPR, GenCos and the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). “We have 203 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of gas that is proved and 600 TCF about to be proved and we have so much gas project already ongoing. What I am saying is that the network code is not only looking at end-users, shippers or transporters. It is also looking at gas explorers and producers; when you look at the issues highlighted, they are issues we have observed with our interactions with you, we will identify them and work through it,” Auwalu said. According to him, the only omission in the concerns of the GenCos was the needs of the explorers and the producers, which determine a lot of things. He assured that the DPR would continue to engage with NERC and commended the GenCos for accepting the code. Auwalu said the drive of the code was to help the country to migrate to the gas economy endowed with a huge deposit of the product and in accordance with President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive that the country must migrate to a gas economy. This, he said, would help to take a lot of Nigerians out of poverty and equally create the needed jobs in the country. “As you know, the president has declared this decade, a decade of gas, and he has given all the support to ensure that it is achieved,” he said.
