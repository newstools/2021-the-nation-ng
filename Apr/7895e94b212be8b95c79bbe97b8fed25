Manchester United failed to impose their perceived superiority over old rivals Leeds and had to settle for a point from a disappointing goalless draw.
In a game of few chances, Marcus Rashford came closest with a free-kick just before half-time. But memories of a forgettable encounter will remain around off-field issues. A plane trailing a banner proclaiming ‘2bn stolen – Glazers out’ flew over Elland Road just before kick-off. That it was not set up by any of the organised Manchester United supporter groups just underlines the strength of feeling created by this week’s European Super League controversy, fuelling an already negative view of the club’s American owners. As one of England’s biggest clubs themselves, Leeds will be satisfied at extending their run of home draws against ‘Big Six’ opposition to five, with only Tottenham left to come.
