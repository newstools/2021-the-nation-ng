Immediate past Ondo Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi has said he is in possession of two official vehicles and not four demanded to be returned by Ondo State Government. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has vowed to press charges against Agboola if the vehicles in his (Agboola) possession were not returned. The vehicles are: Land Cruiser SUV, New Toyota Hilux, New Toyota Hilux and Toyota Hilux. In a petition to Ondo Police Command, Governor Akeredolu through his Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties and Strategy, Dr. Doyin Odewale, urged the police to help recover the vehicles. But Agboola who spoke through his media aide, Allen Sowore, said he returned all vehicles in his possession on February 23rd, the day his tenure ended except two vehicles- a Land Cruiser and a Hilux Jeep. Agboola stated that he is entitled to those two vehicles just like other former Deputy Governors in the state. He said one of the vehicles being demanded was at a mechanic workshop in Okitipupa while the other was still with the dealer because full payment has not been made. The former Deputy Governor said Akeredolu should be prepared not to take any government vehicle at the end of his tenure if he (Agboola) is made to return the two vehicles. His words: “The former Deputy Governor has joined senior citizens in this state. He should be accorded such respect. On February 23rd when his tenure ended, civil servants came and collect all government vehicles expect a Land Cruiser and Hilux jeep which are part of his statutory benefit. “He is to go home with those two vehicles. He is not holding onto any government vehicles. All other former Deputy Governors in this state are using government vehicles. Nobody should because of politics use indecent language on the former Deputy Governor. “Let the police invite him. He will explain himself. He is not afraid. One of the other two vehicles had accident. It is at Okitipupa while the dealer is yet to deliver the second one.”
