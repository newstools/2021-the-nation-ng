Only the Ologbostere of Warri kingdom has the prerogative to summon a general assembly of the Itsekiri nation, Chief Ayirimi Emami has declared. He said he still holds the title despite his purported suspension. Chief Emami, in a statement on Friday, said he had made no such summon for the people at Ode-Itsekiri, Warri South council area of Delta state or else where. He noted any gathering of such could lead to break down of law and order, urging security agencies to be at alert. Tension across the kingdom heightened on Friday following reports some persons planned to distort the process of selecting an Omoba, which has been kick started, reportedly by the “Emiko and Ejoh families” of the Ginuwa l ruling house, at the Olu’s palace. But Chief Emami’s statement reads: “Information reaching me is that some unscrupulous elements who want to cause confusion in our dear Warri kingdom, are making frantic efforts to call for a general assembly. “Let it be known, that by virtue of the declaration BDSL 147 pursuant to the Traditional Rulers and Chiefs edict of 1979, which guides the procedure for selection to the succession throne of the Olu of Warri, when an Olu is indisposed, it is only the Ologbostere that has the power to summon the general assembly of the Itsekiri nation. Any action taken by any other person(s) is in confrontation to the edict. “The security agencies are by this notice, urged to hold any person(s) responsible that goes contrary to the law which could cause a breach of peace in Warri kingdom.
Itsekiri nation shall abide by the laws of the land”.
