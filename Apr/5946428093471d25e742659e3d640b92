Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo is once again being linked with a return to his former club Manchester United, as Gazzetta dello Sport claims he is willing to take a pay cut in order to help the deal happen. Ronaldo, 36, has a contract until June 2022 which earns him a reported €31 million-a-year but he is unhappy and keen to move on from Turin as the club have struggled in both the Serie A title race and the Champions League.  Juventus are in financial trouble, so are willing to sanction the Portugal international’s exit, but only for a minimum fee of €29m to help them balance the books. The club would also reportedly consider including Ronaldo in a swap deal for United midfielder Paul Pogba, though that move is more complex. Ronaldo is still one of the world’s best players so isn’t keen to drop his salary below €20m-a-year. He has been linked with a return to Real Madrid, where he won four Champions League trophies in a nine-year spell with the La Liga giants, but club president Florentino Perez told El Chiringuito recently: “Cristiano Ronaldo will not come back to Real Madrid. It does not makes sense, he has a contract with Juventus. I love him a lot, he has given us a lot.”
