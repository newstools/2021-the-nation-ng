St Mark’s Anglican Church Magboro, Diocese of Egba West is rolling out the drums to celebrate its 10th anniversary and thank God for the grace to march on. Billed to hold at the church auditorium on Sunday, April 25th, 2021, the anniversary celebration will be marked with a launching of N25million church building project. According to the Vicar, Rev. Canon Jacob Oladejo, the Father of the Day will be no other than the Diocesan Bishop Rt. Rev. Samuel Ogundeji, to be ably assisted by the Ven. Emmanuel Akinyele, Archdeacon Ibafo Archdeaconry. Chairman, planning committee, Sir George Amadi, said the chief launcher of the day is Dr. Adeolu Adeyeye while Barr. Joseph Eneigbose is the chairman of the day. He noted that special thanksgiving events to thank the Lord for upholding His church in this trying period have been specially prepared and uppermost in their mind is to finish the building project and dedicate it in the shortest possible time. “We want to thank God for sparing our lives after all that has happened around the world. It is by his grace that we are alive and the best way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of His church is to give back onto His glory,” added Rev. Canon Oladejo.
