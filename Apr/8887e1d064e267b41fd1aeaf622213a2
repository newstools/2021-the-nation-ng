Five persons have been reportedly killed in a communal clash between the two border towns of Nyuwar/Jessu in Gombe made up of Waja people and Lunguda in Adamawa on Tuesday. Eyewitnesses said the clash was caused by a misunderstanding between hunters from Jessu and Fulanis from Lunguda in Adamawa who have always had misgivings about themselves. The eyewitness said a group from Jessu had gone to the forest for hunting when Fulani boys saw them and raised the alarm. Their father allegedly started shooting, a development The Nation led to a clash and burning of houses. “What we learnt was that when the Fulani boys saw the hunters they raised alarms that they are being attacked by the hunters and reported to their father. “The Fulani then came and started shooting, up till now that I am talking to you they are still fighting and burning houses,” said the eyewitness. Commissioner of Police, Ishola Babaita, told The Nation he was on his way to the scene of the incident and cannot make comment yet. Governor Inuwa Yahaya and other top government functionaries were also said to be on their way to the scene of the incident. To douse tension, Gombe Government imposed a 24- hour curfew on Nyuwar, Jessu and Yolde communities in Balanga Local Government area with immediate effect. Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Ibrahim Njodi, said the decision followed the violence that erupted in the communities. He said security personnel have been deployed to restore normalcy while the curfew subsists until further notice.
