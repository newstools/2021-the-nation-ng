The crisis rocking the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) appears to be deepening, as an estranged member, Prince Kassim Afegbua, on Wednesday alleged money laundering offences against the party leadership. Afegbua, at a news conference in Abuja, insisted on his earlier claims that the Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) had been reckless with the party’s finances. According to him, the PDP leadership has failed to account for N10 billion that the party allegedly generated from the sale of nomination forms for all category of elections during the 2019 general election. He listed the companies allegedly used as conduits by the NWC to launder party funds as including Retrobox Nigeria Limited with a Guarantee Trust Bank Account Number 0019723825; Abdullahi Kabiru, with a United Bank for Africa Account Number 2065267084; and one Morufu Nigeria Limited, which bank account details he could not provide. Afegbua had on Monday, submitted a petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) urging the anti-graft agencies to probe the financial records of the PDP. But the PDP, through its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said yesterday that the party would not dignify Afegbua with further response. He had earlier on Monday described Afegbua’s claims as spurious and irresponsible, saying that there was no truth in the allegations. Afegbua, however, said he was not alone in the quest to have the financial records of the PDP probed by the two anti-graft agencies.
