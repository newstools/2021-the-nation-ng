Jose Mourinho has claimed he will resist the temptation to discuss Manchester United’s prolific threat from the penalty spot with his Tottenham players. United travel to face Spurs tomorrow  having been awarded nine penalties in 30 Premier League games this season, scoring eight. Only Leicester have been awarded more, 10. Bruno Fernandes scored his 11th  penalty of the season in all competitions as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team won 2-0 at Granada in the first leg of their Europa League quarter final on Thursday. “I cannot go to a football match concerned, I can’t,” said Spurs boss Mourinho when asked about United’s penalty threat. “I don’t think it’s the right frame of mind to go to a football match concerned. So I’m not going concerned. And I don’t want my players to be. “They have to go to a football match with positive feelings, enjoying the game, enjoying the dimension and the difficulty of the game. Coping with the responsibility. Coping with the pressure, good pressure. So that’s what I want.
