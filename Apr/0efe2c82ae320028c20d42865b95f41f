He was said to have been interrogated at the DSS headquarters in Osogbo for about four hours before he was released. When contacted, Ekundayo confirmed to The Nation he was invited by DSS noting: “We are not criminals or collaborating with any criminal group. “The security men are just being proactive. We are not secessionists in Kiriji Heritage Defenders. “The decision for the rally to hold in Osun is beyond our group. Other notable groups will take that decision when the time comes. Our major preoccupation is security across Yoruba borders.”
