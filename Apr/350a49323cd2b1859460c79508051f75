Three persons have been killed in Anambra State following a suspected cult clash involving two rival groups. The victims were killed in different locations in Awka on Wednesday afternoon. One youth was killed in Umubele while the other two were killed in Okpuno in Awka South local government area. An eyewitness told The Nation four young men alighted from a tricycle and opened fire on the boys at Okpuno. The incident at Umubele, according to a source, occurred like a movie while the residents scampered for safety when the boys arrived. Confirming the incidents to The Nation, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, said the incidents involved rival cult groups. He said: “It is an incident that involved suspected attack by rival cult groups. “The victims were rushed to the hospital and confirmed dead by a medical doctor on arrival. “Meanwhile, the combined team of anti-cult Operatives and divisional police personnel led by the DPO B Division Awka is right at the scene.” However, he said investigation was ongoing to unravel the perpetrators of what he described as barbaric act.
