A four-month-old baby has been stolen from a bedroom in the Egbeada Housing Estate, Owerri, the Imo State capital. The Nation gathered that the baby thieves broke into the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Sunday Silas, about 11 am on Wednesday and made away with their baby boy. The traumatised mother, Chidimma Sunday Silas said on a breakfast radio programme on Ozisa FM that she had laid the baby and his two-year-old sibling on the beds in her bedroom and locked the doors before going out to buy milk for them. She said that upon her return to the house, she noticed that the doors to their flat were open. “When I looked closely, I noticed that the keys I used to lock the door to my house had been broken. When I went inside, I discovered that my four-month-old baby had been taken away. I felt someone might be playing pranks on me but as the day went by, I didn’t hear anything from anyone,” she said. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu, said he was yet to be briefed on the incident.
