LEICESTER boss Brendan Rodgers has tipped Nigeria forward Kelechi Iheanacho to step into the boots of their top man Jamie Vardy in the future. Rodgers said at Friday’s press conference: “What we are saying is we think he’s going to be a very important striker for us in the future, but you need more than one, that’s for sure. “I think he’s shown in the couple of years that I’ve been here that he has developed and he’s improving and he’s going to a very, very important part of the squad. “There’s no doubt later on down the line once Jamie has finished and moved on we’ll have to have another one, maybe two, so any top club will want to have more than one and that would always be the case. “Kelechi, we’ve seen his development, we’ve seen his improvement, seen his confidence grow, and as you see him now playing he looks a real threat and he looks like he can score goals. “Being so young we know there’s a lot more to come.” Rodgers recently recalled the groans Iheanacho’s involvement would cause during the early part of his City tenure.
