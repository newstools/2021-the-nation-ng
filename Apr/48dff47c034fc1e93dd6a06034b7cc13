Following the staging of a successful seminar for women, the Lagos State Judo Association (LSJA) is aiming to encourage females to take up the sport for self-defense in the society. Speaking at the one-day seminar organized by LSJA in collaboration with Tinubu Support Organisation (TSO) at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Complex, Rowe Park, the chairman of LSJA, Sheriff Hammed said the aim of the seminar was to woo more women to the sports in their effort to popularize the sport as well as a form of self-defense amidst the security challenges bedeviling the country. “This seminar is part of our efforts to revive judo in Lagos and we are using the seminar and judo exhibition to create awareness about violence and sexual harassment against women because of what is happening around the society. This is part of our mission to improve the sports and probably get more female athletes to participate in judo. So this is to enlighten the public and educate our girls about the art of self-defense using the sport to tackle all those happenings in our society.” For the Coordinator of TSG, Niyi Gbodimowo, the partnership was aimed at improving the fortune of judo in Lagos.
