 The Lagos State Government has announced there will be diversion of traffic from main carriageway inbound Anthony from Monday May 3, 2021, for four weeks as part of ongoing reconstruction on Ikorodu Road.
Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederick Oladeinde, in a statement, explained the diversion was necessary in view of the needs to address the worsening state of the access road at the Independence Tunnel, Maryland. He stated the road needs to be fixed urgently to prevent further deterioration of the section, especially with the expected rainfall. He said the repairs will minimise the congestion frequently experienced by motorists along the corridor. The Commissioner advised motorists coming from Ibadan-Lagos Expressway to go through Oworonshoki to connect Gbagada and descend the ramp at Anthony to access Ikorodu Road during the repair works.  He also disclosed the recently improved Maryland Junction will also be opened temporarily during the construction period to accommodate traffic coming from the Ojota axis and Ikorodu. He said a temporary traffic light will be installed to manage the influx of vehicles that will ply the flyover. According to him: “Alternatively, motorists will be diverted to a counterflow on the Ojota bound lane during peak hours to minimise the inconveniences during the course of the repairs. “Road users coming from Ikeja and inbound Surulere are advised to use Mobolaji Bank-Anthony Way to link Maryland and access Ikorodu road inbound Surulere”. He stated a trial run of the traffic management system would commence on Tuesday, 27th April, 2021, to test the aforementioned traffic diversion plans ahead of the set date and make necessary adjustments where necessary.
