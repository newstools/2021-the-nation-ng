The Convener and President of Nigeria Voters Assembly, Comrade Mashood Erubami, has joined other prominent Nigerians in commiserating with the families of the late Afenifere spokesman, Yinka Odumakin and the Director of Ford Foundation (West Africa), Innocent Chukwuma, who passed away recently. In a statement, Erubami described the two departed activists as “motivators and enrichers of civil society and development sectors”. He said their death will leave a big vacuum in the country’s social and political arena. Erubami said the departed activists would be greatly missed within the human rights community because they were “our partners in the struggles for social justice and democratic development”. He added: “Odumakin was the husband of Joe Okei-Odumakin, who was my secretary when I was the National President of the Campaign for Democracy (CD). Similarly, Chukwuma was a comrade in the struggle. He handed over to me as the Chairman of the renowned Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) in 2007. “Though death is the last debt that every human will pay, but the good legacies of the departed comrades will remain evergreen in our minds even if we can no longer see them physically. The Nigeria Voters Assembly commiserates with the families they left behind, particularly their wives and children. “We pray that God grants the families the fortitude to bear the loss. We also pray that the blessing of the Almighty Father would continue to be with them, so that they would not lack the resources to cater for the offsprings they have left behind.”
