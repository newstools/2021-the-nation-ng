All the cows were recovered, save one which was later found dead in a swamp. One cow was also wounded with a machete cut. One herder, Nasril Musa, sustained an injury from being pelted over his right eye. He was taken to hospital where he was treated and discharged.” “The troops escorted the herders to their destination in Bakin Kogi, Kauru LGA, to prevent further tension. “Investigations into the incident are in progress,” said Aruwan.
