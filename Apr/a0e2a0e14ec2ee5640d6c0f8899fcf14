Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze has revealed that they were not afraid of Arsenal. The two sides will meet on Thursday for the Europa League semi-final first leg in Spain on Thursday. Speaking at an event for LiveScore, Chukwueze said: “When the time comes, it will be up to the coach and the tactics he chooses – all I need to do is just enter the field using the skills I have practiced and give everything I have. “We are going to play our football as normal. We are not scared or anything, we are just going to play our football as a team.” The match is also a reunion between Unai Emery and the Gunners. Asked about Emery as a coach, Chukwueze added: “I enjoy playing under Unai Emery. He’s amazing, and so tactical in everything he does. “He can push you to the limit, but he is a fantastic coach. “He has an amazing football brain. He has amazed me how I have seen him change things from game to game. “Sometimes when I watch him from the bench, I have looked at him and noticed changes he makes which work for him that are great to see. He is so good at his job and is a fantastic coach.”
