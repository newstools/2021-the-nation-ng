Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai has vowed he won’t pay ransom even if bandits succeed in kidnapping his son. He said he is so against payment of ransom that he would rather pray his son makes heaven if kidnapped than pay abductors. El-Rufai spoke during a radio interview on Friday. According to him: “I mean it and I will say it again here. Even if my son is kidnapped, I will rather pray for him to make heaven instead because I won’t pay any ransom.” He foreclosed paying ransom to secure the release of the students abducted by bandits from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Kaduna in March 11. According to him, his government is “absolutely not paying ransom” but considering other means to ensure the students are returned to their parents.
