All non-native commercial sex workers operating in Bauchi State are to be profiled and repatriated to their states of origin through the state Sharia Commission. The indigenous ones would be married off by the government, it was said. Permanent Commissioner II in charge of Hisbah in the Shariah Commission, Bauchi State, Aminu Balarabe Isah, made the disclosure at a pre-Ramadan sensitisation workshop held at Bayan Gari area, a suburb of the state metropolis on Tuesday. According to him, the move will enable them to get a  decent source of livelihood. He explained that before their repatriation, data of all the commercial sex workers operating in the state would be taken through a headcount by the commission. He said the repatriation would be done in collaboration with their various states and local government areas. “We are not here to arrest any of you; rather help and repatriate you to your various local government areas and states of origin so that you can engage yourselves in a meaningful and decent life,” the commissioner said. He added: “The recent interview conducted by his office on some of the commercial sex workers has made them realise that some of them are into the indecent trade due to maltreatments from their stepmothers, poverty and illiteracy. “We also discovered that others were forced into the act by the activities of their co-wives,” he stated. Hafsatu Azare, who commended Hisbah for organising the workshop which she termed as “educative and beneficial” promised that if the government would help them with a better source of livelihood, they would quit the indecent means of livelihood.
