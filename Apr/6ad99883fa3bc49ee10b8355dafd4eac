There’s palpable silence at the Abuja hotel of Team Nigeria with doubts over the country’s participation in the World Athletics Relays Silesia21. Most of the athletes are still in the dark over their departure as some of them are awaiting directives from the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development. One of the athletes who pleaded anonymity told NationSport that Nigeria has been a killing joy for her athletes. “I am just in my hotel room with no information from any quarter,” he lamented.   “This is not the first time Nigeria will be doing this for her athletes. “I am just tired of this country because things are not just going well as people are using personal interests to hinder our career, it is very unfair and I think some of us have to think twice because opting to run for this country,”he added.
