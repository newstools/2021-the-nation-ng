Managing Director, NOVA Merchant Bank Limited, Mr Nath Ude said it was gratifying that the wholesale banker achieved such significant growth amidst the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting macro-economic headwinds in 2020. “In 2021, we will continue to build on our strong foundation to significantly scale the business by focussing on exceeding the expectations of our customers through innovative financial solutions while expecting our non-bank subsidiaries to start contributing effectively to the group in line with our strategic intent,” Ude said. Chairman, NOVA Merchant Bank Limited, Mr Phillips Oduoza said it was a delight to see how the bank has maintained its growth trajectory and improve its efficiency during such a challenging period as 2020. “The bank is well positioned to benefit from the expected upsurge in economic activity and profit from the emerging opportunities this presents as the global economy emerges from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis,” Oduoza said.
