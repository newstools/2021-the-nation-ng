Nigeria alone contributes 27 per cent of the global malaria cases and 23 per cent of global malaria deaths, Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire has said, quoting the World Malaria Report 2020. Hence, he said the Federal Government will need N1.89 trillion to reduce the prevalence of malaria to less than 10 per cent as well as cut mortality to less than 50 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2025. Ehanire noted that the government may not have the N352 billion required for the implementation of the strategic plan for malaria programme this year, soliciting the support of the private sector, corporate organisations, and patriotic individuals. This came as the World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed that Nigeria loses $1.1 billion every year to malaria-related absenteeism and productivity. It noted that malaria is responsible for an average annual reduction of 1.3 per cent in Africa’s economic growth. Speaking during an event to commemorate this year’s World Malaria Day, with the theme – “Zero Malaria – Draw the Line Against Malaria,” the minister said: “Nigeria alone contributes 27 per cent (World Malaria Report 2020) of the global malaria cases and 23 per cent (WMR 2020) of global malaria deaths. “In the years of intensive and dedicated programme implementation in Nigeria, indicators have shown a positive trend. Use of Insecticide-treated nets among Under-5 children increased from 43.4 per cent (2015) to 52 per cent (2018), while pregnant women increased use from 49 per cent (2015) to 58 per cent (2018).  Fever testing of Under-5 children increased from 5 per cent in 2010 to 11 per cent in 2013, 13 per cent in 2015 and 14 per cent in 2018; but is still too low. “As part of efforts to achieve universal health coverage and household ownership of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) in Nigeria, 17,267,410 ITNs were distributed in six states, using single-phase door-to-door and double phase door-to-door strategies, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the New Net Project (NNP) study commenced in four local government areas in two states, to help accelerate the scale-up of the next generation ITNs, thereby mitigating the increasing resistance to pyrethroid-only nets. “These measures resulted in reduction of malaria prevalence from 42 per cent in 2010 to 27 per cent 2015 and 23 per cent in 2018. We expect that when results of the 2021 Malaria Indicator Survey to be conducted later this year are out, a further downward trend will be seen. We shall continue to work hard to ensure less than 10 per cent parasite prevalence and reduce malaria mortality to less than 50 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2025, the target set out by the National Malaria Strategic Plan of 2021 to 2025.”
