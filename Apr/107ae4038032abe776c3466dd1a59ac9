Two persons have been killed in renewed boundary dispute between Ezilo and Iyionu communities in Íshíelu local government area of Ebonyi state. Governor David Umahi confirmed this on Tuesday after a security council meeting at the old Government House in Abakaliki. He expressed dismay at the role played by the councillor representing the area in the crisis. According to him, the government committee working on the land dispute was on the verge of resolving the dispute having declared the disputed land as buffer zone. “But the Councillor took some foreign investors to the land and this led to shootings during which two persons died,” he said The Governor ordered the arrest of the councillor. Umahi said all herdsmen in the state had left the state before the recent herdsmen attack. He urged them not to come back for now as there is still tension in the state. Umahi also frowned at the recent resumption of crisis in Effium, which he blamed on publications in some conventional and social media by one Pascal Oluchukwu. Details shortly…
