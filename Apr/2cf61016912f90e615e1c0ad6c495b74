Cross-dresser Okuneye Idris Olanrewaju, popularly called Bobrisky has explained why she is not participating in the ongoing Muslim fast. She said her monthly cycle flow has prevented her from being part of the yearly Ramadan. According to her: “People have been asking me y I’m not fasting, well have been on my period lately!!!! As you all know women fasting are usually not complete.” Social media users have reacted to her claim. oloribecca wrote: “Please I need space to faint.” ogehbaby_ tweeted: “Omg!!!! mummy hope is not too painful.” wf_annabelle said: “bob will not kill me in this Lagos.” @Di6ixxNuel said: “Ahhhh!
