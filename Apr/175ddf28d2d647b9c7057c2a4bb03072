Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig. General Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), says they are pressing on with offensive action against illicit drugs’ production laboratories and farms because of the threat they pose to Nigeria’s national security. Marwa stated this in his presentation on the National Drug Control Master Plan at a side event at the Commission on Narcotic Drugs conference taking place in Vienna, Austria. Director, Media and Advocacy, NDLEA Headquarters, Abuja, Femi Babafemi, made this known in a statement in Abuja on Friday. According to the statement, Marwa said, “Nigeria was traditionally considered a transit country for drug trafficking. Now the problem is much bigger as different categories of drugs are produced, consumed and trafficked in the country. Drugs trafficked include cannabis, cocaine, heroin and psychotropic substances including methamphetamine and tramadol. “Cannabis is cultivated in different parts of the country and there is evidence of methamphetamine producing laboratories. NDLEA has destroyed thousands of hectares of cannabis cultivated land as well as 18 methamphetamine manufacturing laboratories.” He said a situation where the drug use prevalence in Nigeria is 14.4 % is unacceptable and as such every necessary step must be taken to reverse the trend.
