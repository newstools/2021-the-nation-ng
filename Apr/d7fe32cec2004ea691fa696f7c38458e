 Filmmaker and a leading figure in the faith-based movie genre, Biodun Stephen has opened up on her new film, ‘Breaded Life,’ calling it a sequel to her box office hit, ‘Picture Perfect.’ Stephen, in a chat, confirmed that the comedy is a spin-off of her 2016 romantic comedy, ‘Picture Perfect’. “After Picture Perfect, people wanted a sequel but I was afraid and asking, will it be as good? So I wrote BreadedLife as a sequel that will feature some characters from Picture Perfect.” On Saturday, the movie premiered at iMax Cinema, Lagos to a select audience including Toyin Abraham, Timini Egbuson, MC Lively, Lateef Adedimeji, movie critics, and enthusiasts. Breaded Life, an inspirational thriller that evokes a mixed feeling of laughter, pity, and tension, is set to hit cinemas across Nigeria on April 16. Stephen further said, “If you are attuned with Agege Bread or have heard tales of the popular Agege Bread, then the movie fills your mouth with a satirical depiction of breaded life in that hood. The plot has several twists that drag the audience’s emotions high, with much comic relief to calm the nerves.” With a stellar cast that includes MC Lively, Bisola Aiyeola, Timini Egbuson, Bimbo Ademoye, Bolanle Ninalowo, Adedimeji Lateef, Tina Mba, Amuda Eko, Funny Bone, Jide Kosoko, Lizzy Jay, Nkechi Blessing Sunday, Tomiwa Sage and Karen Spikes, ‘Breaded Life’ is co-produced by Tara Ajibulu, Kayode Sowade, and Biodun Stephen. The film, written and directed by Biodun Stephen, tells the story of an irresponsible young man who wakes to find no one can recognize him except a local bread seller.
