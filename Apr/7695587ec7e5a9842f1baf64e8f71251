Chelsea midfielder Jorginho has told ESPN Brasil that former manager Frank Lampard “wasn’t ready” for the managerial job because he “skipped a few steps.” Lampard took charge at Stamford Bridge in 2019 to replace Maurizio Sarri and led the club to a top four finish and an FA Cup final during his debut campaign. It was viewed as a successful season after Chelsea had lost star player Eden Hazard to Real Madrid and were unable to sign players due to a FIFA transfer ban.  Chelsea spent £220 million last summer but Lampard failed to get the best out of signings Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, which resulted in his sacking in January. Jorginho only played the full 90 minutes on four occasions under Lampard this season and said the club’s all-time record goalscorer needed more experience in management before taking over at Chelsea. “Look, I’ll be really sincere here on Lampard. I believe, given he was a legend at the club, he skipped some steps necessary for learning before moving to a big club,” Jorginho told ESPN Brasil’s Resenha.
