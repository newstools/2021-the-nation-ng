The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) on Tuesday began an indefinite strike over poor funding. The union said its action followed the failure of the Federal Government to address the sorry state of polytechnics and monotechnics and the expiration of the ultimatum it issued in March 2020. Announcing the industrial action at a media briefing yesterday in Abuja, ASUP President Anderson Ezeibe said academic activities had been shut shown in all polytechnics and allied institutions nationwide with effect from 12 a.m on Tuesday. Despite an emergency meeting yesterday with Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, the ASUP President insisted that the strike would continue. Ezeibe said the decision to withdraw services was reached at the union’s 99th National Executive Council (NEC) in Katsina State a fortnight ago. According to him, the union’s demands were communicated to the Federal ministries of Education, Labour and Employment as well as the governors without any positive response. Ezeibe listed the lecturers’ grievances to include non-implementation of 2014 NEEDS Report and non-release of revitalisation fund to the sector despite assurances since 2017. Others, he said, are alleged victimisation of union officials, non-establishment of a commission to bridge regulatory gaps in the sector, non-implementation of the approved 65 years as the retirement age by some state governments, claims of purported tax liabilities, and opaque operations in the deployment of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS).
