Niger Delta Minister Senator Godswill Akpabio has said he has no preferred governorship candidate from Uyo senatorial district for the 2023 election in Akwa Ibom state. Akpabio, who stated this at the weekend during the inauguration of executives of Uyo Senatorial District chapter of Akwa Ibom Democratic Forum (ADF), dispelled fears that he plans to impose a governorship candidate on the party and the state.

Akpabio is from Akwa Ibom North West (or Ikot Ekpene senatorial District). In the last few months, the former Governor has been busy creating a political pressure group known as Akwa Ibom Democratic Forum in the state, triggering impressions the group is his special purpose vehicle through which his anointed candidate would emerge. ‘‘My goal is to work with like-minded associates in Uyo Senatorial District (USD) and nominate a suitable candidate that would win the election. I have no particular person in mind, and I cannot repeat the mistake I made in 2015. ”Akwa Ibom people of various political persuasions do agree that we need a dependable leadership in 2023. ‘’In that case, I will work with all of you to identify and support any candidate that will develop our state…’’, he said. He added: ‘’Uyo Senatorial District is capable of bringing up good a good candidate that would be acceptable to the rest of the state. ADF will work with Uyo in this regard’’, he said. Former two-time military administrator of Ogun and Rivers states, Group Captam Sam Ewang retd confirmed that Akpabio will not impose any candidate on Uyo.
