Henry Onyekuru will not sign a permanent contract with Turkish giants Galatasaray and so he will return to AS Monaco at season’s end. Onyekuru has enjoyed his third loan spell at ‘Gala’ and the Istanbul giants have an option to sign him for 4.3 million Euros thereafter. But according to Sabah, Galatasaray will not trigger this buy-out clause and as such the forward will head back in June to parent club Monaco, where he has so far failed to crack it. The Turkish club, according to various reports, say he has not done enough to earn a permanent deal and would rather put their cash on Gedson Fernandes and Halil Dervisoglu, who have shone lately. They have opted to renegotiate the  five million Euros fee for Halil from English Championship club Brentford, while they are prepared to pay more as loan fee for Gedson.
