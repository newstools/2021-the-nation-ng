IT is looking more and more likely that Paul Onuachu will depart Racing Genk in the summer transfer window. According to Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, Racing Genk would be forced into selling the prolific striker if they receive a bid in the region of 25 million euros. And if that happens, the Super Eagle would be the most expensive sale by the Limburgers, surpassing the fee they received for the likes of Sander Berge (€23m), Wilfred Ndidi (€18m), Thibaut Courtois (€8.95m), Christian Benteke (€8.8m) and Kevin De Bruyne (€8m).
