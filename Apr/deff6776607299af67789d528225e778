The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, has said Nigeria is in serious jeopardy without restructuring. Aare Adams spoke in Lagos at the launching of “Roundtable discussion on economy and restructuring in Nigeria” by National Pilot Books, a subsidiary of National Pilot Newspapers. He said he is reluctant to speak about restructuring “because the prevailing view of our people, particularly those in the Diaspora, is that we have graduated beyond the restructuring we have been clamouring for since 1991 through Alao Aka-Bashorun to self-determination”. He added: “If Nigeria is not restructured within the next three years, I suspect the future of this country would be in jeopardy. “If we must restructure, it is better for us to borrow the contents of the Independence Constitution of 1960 and the Republican Constitution that our forefathers wrote in 1963, which gives room for federating units to be semi-autonomous, which gives room for regionalism, and which gives room for every federating unit to develop at its own pace. “Nigeria has six federating units that were adopted at the constitutional conference organised by the Abacha regime in 1995 or 1996. The six zones can be made the federating units or regions. That is the minimum demand of the Yoruba nation.” Adams said the Yoruba nation is prepared for negotiation because all politics are local and that there is no way Nigerians can achieve the unity of the country without taking cognizance of the interests of its constituent parts.
