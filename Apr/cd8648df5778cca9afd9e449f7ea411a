 Lugard,’ a new film featuring Gabriel Afolayan, Mr. Macaroni, and Kehinde Bankole is scheduled for an August 2021 release. The 3 Knights Film Production in conjunction with B5Films and Monomania Entertainment project tells the intriguing story of an intelligent new entry University student who was initiated into cultism due to his intimidating brainpower. After his first assignment which led to the death of a rival confraternity leader, Lugard’s life is being hunted. The film also features Adeniyi Johnson, Hafiz ‘Saka’ Oyetoro, Omowunmi Dada, Zack Orji, Norbert Young, Laduba Quadri Qidad, Kalu Ikeagwu, and Tunji Adeyemo.  The action-packed film is directed by Tunde Olaoye and written by Laduba Quadri Qidad and Segun Akejeje. Speaking on the movie, the executive producer, Hakeem Olageshin said, “When I speak about Lugard the movie, it gives me so much joy to see the beautiful piece of art my team and I put together. Cultism and Confraternity still remains a big issue in this part of the world as the original reason why they were created have been completely altered for violence and other humiliating selfish interest that exactly inspired this intriguing story. I would really love everyone to storm the cinemas on the 27th of August because LUGARD the movie is a must-see for everyone.”
