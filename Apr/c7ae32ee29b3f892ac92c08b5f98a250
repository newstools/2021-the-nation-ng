The three top rated teams at the NWFL Premiership Super Six; Edo Queens, Bayelsa Queens and Rivers Angels, will today at the Dipo Dina International Stadium, Ijebu-Ode be presented with the opportunity to redeem themselves and again play their teams back into contention. Unless they redeem their aspirations in today’s Match Day Three, they will be out of contention for the league title and ticket for the WAFU B qualifiers for the CAF Women Champions League. The first match of the day at 10am, will be the ‘Battle of the Creeks’ between multiple champions and the league leaders at the end of the first round Bayelsa Queens and 2018 champion, and highly rated Rivers Angels. The result of the second game of the Match Day 3, between Edo Queens of Benin and FC Robo of Lagos, would be mixed fortunes. It’s a must-win for Edo Queens, after losing two straight games and having zero points The last match of the day which kicks off at 4pm, between Sunshine Queens and Delta Queens will be very crucial, as the result will either make or mar the chances of any of the queens.
