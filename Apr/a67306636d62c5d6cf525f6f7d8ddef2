Sheffield United chairman, Prince Musaad Bin Khalid Al Saud, has resigned from his position. Prince Musaad became the Premier League’s youngest chairman in September 2019 when appointed by his father-in-law and club owner Prince Abdullah at the age of 26. He leaves his post with the Blades bottom of the Premier League table having collected only 14 points from 31 matches this season. They are 18 points adrift of safety. In a statement by the club, Prince Abdullah said: “On behalf of the board of directors, I offer our thanks to Prince Musaad for his efforts, he has made a valuable contribution to the development of the football club.”
