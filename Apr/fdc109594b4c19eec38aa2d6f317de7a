Terem Moffi will not be eligible to succeed compatriot Victor Osimhen as the Best African Player in the French Ligue 1 this season despite his goal scoring exploits and scintillating form. The 21-year-old, who has already notched 14 league goals, a goal more than Osimhen achieved at Lille last season, will not be nominated for the Marc Vivien Foe Award as he is yet to be capped by the Super Eagles. To win this award, a player has to have been capped at international level and also have played a minimum of 20 games in a season. Moffi, who was playing in lowly Lithuania two seasons ago, has already featured 28 times for the Le Merlus and has made scoring against France’s traditional big clubs his specialty; three goals against Monaco, two against Marseille and one against PSG. While Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has taken note of Moffi’s exploits, he was only named on standby for last month’s AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho. However, the former KV Kortrijk of Belgium star remains unfazed and revealed he wants to remain with the Brittany-based club should the club win its race to stay in Ligue 1. “I am having fun in Lorient and I want to stay here,” he told the Ouest-France regional daily after his hat trick in a 4-1 win over Bordeaux on Sunday.
