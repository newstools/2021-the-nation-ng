Kwara State government has charged teachers in the state to abstain from all dresses that are capable of demoralising the public as they are perceived as role models. Chairman of the state Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) Mallam Taueed Bello said this while addressing a group of teachers in Ilorin, the state capital. Mallam Bello warned teachers in the state against indecent dressing, advising them to adhere strictly to the dress code of the civil service. He added that teachers as character moulders are expected to always show good example to the students. “You have to be role models to your students and shun immodest dressing. Teachers as character moulders should always show good example to their students. You should form the habit of dressing decently in the course of discharging your constitutional duties”, the TESCOM boss said. He stressed the need for teachers to be steadfast and committed to their duties and shun indolence with a view to restoring the lost glory of education in the state. He also sought for their support and cooperation in order to ensure the success of the present administration in the education sector.
