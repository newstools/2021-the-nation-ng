Foremost service support provider specialising in end-to-end information technology (IT) services within enterprise organisations, Hutchlam Services Limited, has stressed the need to give technology support for kids to guarantee a bright future. Its Managing Partner, Mr. Mesahidu Elamah, who spoke when the firm paid  a visit to Living Fountain Orphanage in Lekki, Lagos, the children are the future of the country, adding that it is, therefore, imperative that they be supported. He said: “Our children are the future of our great nation and we recognise  the need to nurture and support the next generation and what better time than now in the spirit of the Easter festivities to reach out and share our love for these precious little children. From our entire staff and management, we want to wish them a happy Easter and it is our hope that our gifts will put a smile on their faces as they celebrate this Easter.” Ms. Tonia Uchenna urged more corporates and individuals to emulate Hutchlam Services by lending support to orphanages. “I am pleased about this laudable initiative from Hutchlam Services, I want to implore other corporates and indeed individuals who have the capacity to support orphanages across the length and breadth of Nigeria to do so,”she said.
