Pupils of two secondary schools in the Old Garage area of Osogbo, the Osun State capital, clashed on Tuesday, with three of them arrested. Students of Osogbo Grammar School and Government Technical College Osogbo attacked each other with clubs and stones. An eyewitness said, “Those students caused a scene as they attacked each other. Policemen attempted to arrest them but were repelled with stones and sticks. The Amotekun corps also tried to restore peace but the students were hell-bent on attacking each other. “They later unleashed mayhem at Old Garage area and some men of the Hunters Group of Nigeria arrested three of them and handed them to the police.” Special Adviser to the Governor on Education Jamiu Olawumi confirmed that three of the students were arrested.
