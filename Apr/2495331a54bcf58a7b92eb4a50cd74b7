The AISEN 2021 public speaking presentation had a total of 38 schools competing in the KS4 and KS3 categories with Okenedun and Babatunde both presenting a very thorough and interesting paper. According to the Schools’ Director of Studies, Dr. Yinka Oduwole, these achievements come at the right time with the release of EDUSKO’s 2021 ranking of best schools in Nigeria, where Rainbow College is ranked 5th on the list. The EDUSKO ranking is based on students’ performance in National and International examinations as well as recent awards and recognitions, quality & accomplishments of alumni, school leadership and management. Coming at COVID-19 time, when the classroom learning system was greatly distorted, Rainbow College was quick to spring into action with its borderless classroom initiative, which got its students in top form with an outstanding 100% A1-C6 pass in minimum five subjects, including English and Mathematics, as well as 81% distinction in other subjects in the 2020 WAEC examinations. “Although COVID-19 stopped many things, it didn’t stop our learning and teaching. We have deployed loads of interactive resources to enthuse and extend the learning of our children and young people to participate in a range of progressive and creative ‘out of classroom’ learning experiences, which our well-trained and expert teachers continue to provide remotely throughout this period and beyond,” Oduwole said. Rainbow College operates both day and boarding schools in Surulere, Lagos and Marba, Ogun State.
