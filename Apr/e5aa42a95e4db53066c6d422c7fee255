Worried by the absence of the fun and fanfare that characterise Children’s Day celebrations in many Lagos State schools on May 27 of every year, Sterling Homes is perfecting plans to revive that tradition in a local council development authority (LCDA) of the state. Kunle Adeyemi, the company’s CEO, told journalists that the gesture was part of the firm’s corporate social responsibility (CSR). “We are taking off this year and we are starting with 27 primary Schools in Odi-Olowo/Ojuwoye LCDA of the state.  We want to revive this tradition by giving back joy and value to the children,” Adeyemi said. “It is our  plan to celebrate this year’s Children’s Day in grand style, involving all 27 primary schools in the community,” he said, recalling how the Day in his time was a day of celebration for children as they looked forward to the March Past and other fun-filled activities. When Adeyemi visited the Odi-Olowo/Ojuwoye LCDA Chairman, Razaq Olusola Ajala, to discuss his intention, Ajala thanked the CEO for choosing his community, expressing excitement about the initiative. The company’s decision to organise the Children’s Day celebration is coming on the heels of unveiling its new brand identity which, according to the CEO, is one of the many steps to their next level of excellence-driven service and product delivery. He said the company hopes to reverse the housing deficit in Nigeria.
