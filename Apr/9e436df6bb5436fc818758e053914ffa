The media girl made this known via her Instagram Stories on Thursday, April 15, 2020.⁣ Kadiri called out the organisers of Eko Star Film & TV awards for not recognising her at the just concluded award ceremony honouring women in Nollywood. The media personality wrote: “For the actress (atink it was Ruth Kadiri because there are so many ‘actresses’ now) who didn’t get recognised this year. Remember that last year there was no platform to even be recognised so instead of being bitter, be better now there is a platform and maybe next year will be your year or maybe not,. “Let’s give Mo Abudu her flowers while she is alive abeg. Every platform this woman has, she uses to celebrate women constantly. Celebrate with others and maybe they will celebrate with you.”⁣
