Popular Islamic scholar, Sheikh Muhyideen Ajani Bello, yesterday said Oyo State has gone back to the era of hooliganism. According to him, nothing has changed for good in the state after Ajimobi left office as the governor. Sheikh Bello said this during the 1st Annual Ishaq Abiola Ajimobi Memorial Ramadan Lecture at Ishaq Abiola Ajimobi Central Mosque, Oke-Ado, Ibadan, the Oyo state capital. According to him, the former governor of Oyo State, has died, but the legacy he left behind cannot be forgotten by the people of the state. Sheikh Bello noted that Ajimobi tried his best while alive touching many lives, adding that people of the state particularly Muslims will miss the ex-governor. He said: “Insecurity has returned to the state, people can no longer move freely, we have gone back to the era of hooliganism where people in the state can no longer sleep with their two eyes again.” Chairman of the event, Alhaji, Mutiu Oladejo a.k.a. Onimalu said that people in the state missed positive impact of the late Ajimobi, saying that the legacy left behind by the late governor cannot be over emphasise. He, however, called on Muslims across the state to come together and support themselves, and stops looking for their mistakes. “Ajimobi has done his best while alive which people in the state can never forget his footprint,” he said.
