The trio of Blessing Oborududu, Aminat Adeniyi and Adijat Idris has qualified for Tokyo Olympic Games at the ongoing Africa/Oceania Olympic Qualifying tournament in Tunisia. Finalists in all the events automatically qualify for Tokyo Olympic Games. Oborududu, who competed in the women’s 68kg of freestyle, was unbeaten to emerge as the overall champion in her category. Despite losing one of her matches, Adeniyi finished second in the 62kg to pick a ticket while Idris finished second in the 50kg to also berth in Tokyo. However, the fourth Nigerian, Bose Samuel, failed in her bid despite picking a bronze in the women’s 53kg. She failed to make it to the final where she would have secured an automatic ticket to the Olympic Games. Four women will compete in the wrestling event for Nigeria at the Olympics after Odunayo Adekuoroye qualified after finishing on the podium at the 2019 World Championship. Five Nigeria men will on Sunday, April 4 compete in the men’s freestyle for places at Tokyo Olympic Games.
