Bayelsa State Government has said it will re-launch its security outfit code-named Operation Doo Akpo, to complement the efforts of other security agencies and maintain law and order. Deputy Governor Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo made this known on Wednesday at a meeting with monarchs from Yenagoa Local Government, held at the Government House, Yenagoa. Ewhrudjakpo, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Doubara Atasi, restated the need for traditional rulers to be vigilant and take charge of security in their domains. Reminding them of banditry and destruction of lives and property in other parts of the country, he assured the monarchs that the government was working to beef up security. The Chairman of Yenagoa Traditional Rulers Council, King Funpere Akah, lamented that the state government had taken over almost all the sources of revenue to the local governments. He appealed to the current administration to return Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) producing facilities legally owned by the Yenagoa Council and pledged the commitment of the monarchs to work with the government to enhance peace and development.
