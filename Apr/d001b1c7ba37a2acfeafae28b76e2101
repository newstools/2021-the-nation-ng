Two men said to be notorious robbers at the Tombia Market in Yenagoa Local Government Government Area of Bayelsa State have been arrested. They were arrested on Tuesday by members of the Vigilante Service. The suspects Kingsley Maxwell, 20, and James Ebi, 23, were apprehended shortly after robbing one Gold Ebi at the market, it was said. Ebi said she was in the market when the two robbers accosted her and snatched her bag. “Immediately, I raised the alarm. That alerted the men of the Bayelsa State Vigilante Service who were around the market at the time. I saw them chase and apprehend the thieves,” she said. Traders and pedestrians said the suspects had been terrorising the markets on a daily basis, even in broad daylight. A source, James Oyinkuro, confirmed that one of the suspects robbed his Point of Sale (POS) shop a few weeks ago. Several traders acknowledged that the two men were dreaded criminals who operated within the Tombia Roundabout regularly. Speaking to reporters shortly after the arrest, the Chairman of the State Vigilante Service, Doubiye Alagba warned criminals in the Tombia Roundabout area and other parts of the state to turn a new leaf or face the full wrath of the law.
