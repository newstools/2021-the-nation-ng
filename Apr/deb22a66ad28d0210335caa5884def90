A trending post by Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has sparked outrage on social media. The agency over weekend shared a post containing a short message to Nigerians via its Twitter handle. “Hey Guys, you may need to think deeply over that bogus offer of a better life abroad. You may end up in modern day slavery. Not all that glitters is gold,” the post reads. Reacting to the post, many took out their frustration on the agency over the unavailability of passport booklets. Some others berated the agency for not engaging the services of a professional graphic designer before putting up the post. Emmanuel Michael reacted: “Instead of focusing on the issuance of passport booklets, you are getting involved in matters that are not meant for you. Please focus.” Oguntayo Seun said: “Please go and make Passport Production and Collection seamless first before providing advice as “Big Brother”. Timilehin Morighanfen tweeted: “Slavery abroad is better than having a BSc and MSc without a job here in Nigeria. “You will return to Nigeria and buy a duplex on the Island, Abuja and build one in your village. Secured future await your children. If you doubt it, let me move first.” Ganiu Oloruntade said: “Nigeria is a satire; one with seemingly endless theatrics that trigger cacophonies of laughter.” Aishbil said: “Are we not indirectly subjected to the same modern slavery here at home? Worst still, it is done in an insecure and poverty stricken enviroment.”
