Suspected political thugs on Saturday disrupted the North-West Zonal Congress of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) at Kaduna International Trade Fairground. It was not clear what caused the chaotic situation but there were insinuations supporters of key contenders were responsible for the unfortunate development that led to the destruction of ballot boxes and chairs. The major contenders for the position of National Vice Chairman Northwest are Sen. Bello Hayatudeen Gwarzo, Aminu Wali and a candidate of former Kano Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso. A source alleged supporters loyal to Senator Kwankwaso were responsible for the chaotic situation. But The Nation couldn’t independently confirm this. The source hinted the thugs had already taken over the venue before the commencement of the congress and “when they foresaw the possibility of their leader losing out, they became aggressive and turned things upside down”.
