Access Bank Plc is a good stock to buy as it has potential to sustain overall growth and profitability in the period ahead. Analysts at United Capital Plc, a publicly quoted investment banking group, at the end of comprehensive analysis of full-year earnings report of Access Bank for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the outlook for the bank, placed buy rating on the first tier bank. Analysts stated that Access Bank has shown resilience in a tough environment and the structure and diversity of its operations should sustain top-line and bottom-line growths in the current business year. “We expect Access Bank to sustain top and bottom-line expansion in 2021. While non-interest income growth should taper going forward, as the economy stabilises, we imagine that rebounding asset yields, supported by massive balance sheet size and gains from expansion activities, should spur interest income growth,” United Capital stated. According to analysts, the well-diversified nature of the loan book of the bank is expected to sustain asset quality and thus keep non-performing loans and cost of risk within prudential limits. With these, analysts stated that they expected pre and post tax profits to remain broadly stable in 2021, after the bank grew pre-tax profit by 13 per cent from N111.9 billion in 2019 to N125.9 billion in 2020. Analysts said while there were concerns about the retracement in the yield environment which has resulted in a significant spike in risk-free rate assumption and reduced the appetite for riskier assets such as equities, Access Bank’s shares remain a good buy with possibility of double-digit capital appreciation of about 14 per cent. Analysts noted that with its string of acquisitions and expansion across the African continent, including Cameroon, Kenya, Zambia and South Africa, the management of the bank plans to leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement to expand its footprint to 20 countries across Africa. “As such, in addition to the already concluded acquisitions, plans are currently in place to enter Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Angola, Namibia and Ethiopia. A sum of $60 million was paid to acquire south Africa’s Grobank, a major milestone in the bank’s foray into the south African market and a critical factor in driving intra-African trade by widening its trade finance operations,” United Capital stated. According to the equities research report, on the proposed reorganisation of the bank into a holding company structure, the management of the bank plans to also accomplish an expansion plan outside Africa by setting up representative offices in China, India and Lebanon, using its London operation as an anchor for growth. The Access Bank Group will be organised into Nigeria, Rest of Africa and international, Payment Business, Consumer Lending and Agency Banking and Insurance Brokerage. “The overall objective of the structure will be to create new revenue lines at minimal risk, diversify earnings, and support international expansion,” the report stated.
