Foreigners working in Nigeria can voluntarily participate in the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). The Nation found that the foreigners are, however, not mandated by law to participate in the scheme. Similarly, Nigerians working abroad are not mandated by law to participate in the CPS but may voluntarily do so. Any one who resigns from an organisation in Nigeria and takes up appointment outside the country, the National Pension Commission says, is entitled to make arrangements with the new employer to continue remitting his pension contributions into his or her RSA in Nigeria. But if the person chooses to discontinue with the scheme in Nigeria or the new employer has an entirely different pension arrangement, he or she may access his RSA upon retirement or attaining 50, the commission noted. Meanwhile, employees in the public service of the Federation, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), states, local governments and private sector organisations with three or more employees are mandated to be covered by the CPS by their employers. Also, employees of organisations withÂ  fewer than three employees as well as self-employed persons can voluntarily take part in the CPS under the Micro Pension Plan (MPP). Those exempted from the scheme are judicial officers, members of the Armed Forces, the Intelligence and Secret Services of the Federation; retirees under any pension scheme existing before June 30, 2004; and employees who had three or less years to retire as at June 30, 2004.
