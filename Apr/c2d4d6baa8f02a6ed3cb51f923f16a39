Qatar will host the draw for the FIFA Arab Cup 2021 at Katara Opera House in Doha today at 9 PM local time. The tournament will be contested by 23 Arab nations from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The draw will be attended by a limited number of officials, in line with Qatar’s COVID-19 protocols. The FIFA Arab Cup will be held at the end of 2021 and is seen as a vital opportunity to test operations and facilities exactly a year before Qatar hosts the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East and Arab world. The finals of both events are set to take place on 18 December – Qatar’s National Day. Matches will take place at six Qatar 2022 tournament venues, some of which have hosted top-level football in recent months, while others are in the final stages of construction. The 23 nations participating in the FIFA Arab Cup 2021: Qatar (host nation), Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Meanwhile, the qualifying matches for the tournament have been decided. Of the 23 nations involved, the 14 lowest-ranked teams according to the April edition of the FIFA/Coca-Cola World Rankings will participate in single-leg play-offs ahead of the tournament, which will be held later this year. The tournament will consist of a group stage and knockout rounds. The 16 teams will be split into four groups of four, with the top two from each progressing to the quarter-finals. Matches will be played at six FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ tournament venues. Today’s draw will be made by four FIFA legends: Wael Gomaa (Egypt), Nawaf Al Temyat (Saudi Arabia), Haytham Mustafa (Sudan) and Younus Mahmood (Iraq), along with FIFA’s Director of Competitions, Manolo Zubiria.
