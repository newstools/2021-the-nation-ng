 Two sisters and entertainers, Diva and Posh Owoniyi have set a standard for children contortionists. 12 and 9-year-old Diva and Posh, who are singers, models, and actors, have been able to explore their rare talent with support from family. Speaking on how her mum had supported her dream, Diva said: “My mum told me that I was born with hypermobile bones and could twist my body to strange positions at the early stage of two. The same applies to my younger sister, Posh. Mum saw talent in us and decided to embrace it”. To raise awareness for Contortion in Nigeria, especially amongst Nigerian children, Diva and Posh organized a challenge tagged ‘Nigerian Children Contortionists and Flexibility Challenge’, geared towards discovering more children like them. “A lot of parents restricted their children from participating in the challenge, with excuses and claims that Diva and Posh are not normal children, some even insinuated sorcery. But, in the end, we were able to discover 8 Nigerian children contortionists who also won gift prizes.” says, Diva and Posh’s mum, Chantal Owoniyi. The duo disclosed how they have been able to navigate between school and rehearsal. Poshexplained that the pandemic has had a positive impact on their lives because it gave them enough time to practice and get better during the lockdown. Reassuring parents that contortion is safe and causes no damage to the female reproductive system, Diva and Posh appealed to Nigerian parents to not bury their children’s talents, no matter how rare it may seem but help nurture them to be the best.
