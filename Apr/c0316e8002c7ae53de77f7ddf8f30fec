 The occasion was the 47th birthday of powerful and highly celebrated gospel singer, Osinachi Kalu Egbu, better known as Sinach. The venue was the Skylounge of Eko Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos. And the biggest attraction was praise and worship. No doubt, friends and family members who made it to Sinach’s birthday bash had a swell time on Wednesday. The sheer excitement on their faces and enthusiasm to take photos with the celebrant sold them out. Apart from the food and drinks, Joe Praise, Frank Edwards, Chioma Jesus, Sammy Okposo and Buchi  entertained the guests.
