The Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, has ordered the posting of Christopher Owolabi as new Commissioner of Police (CP) of Anambra Police Command. The deployment of the new CP, Baba said, is part of the ongoing efforts at re-ordering, overhauling and strengthening the security and policing architecture in Anambra, South-East and South-South regions. The development, according to a highly-placed source in the Police Force, is connected to the unending insecurity situation in the South-East and South-South which has led to the killing of many people. The Force Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba, in a statement on Friday said the redeployment is ultimately designed to improve the operational efficiency of the commands and enhance public safety and security. CP Chris Owolabi takes over from CP Monday Bala Kuryas, who has been redeployed to the Anti-Fraud Section of the Force Headquarters Annex, Lagos. Mba said: “In a similar vein, the IGP has ordered the posting of other strategic and tactical commanders within the zones. “A total of two Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs), fourteen (14) Assistant Commissioners of Police and other mid-level officers were affected”. The IGP charged the new Commissioner of Police in Anambra State to take adequate measures in consolidating and improving on the gains of his predecessor. Baba, in the statement, advised the new CP to rejig the security apparatus of the State, harness the full potential of the command, its workforce, assets and stakeholders to advance the collective safety of all citizens. The IGP also enjoined residents in South-East and South-South zones to cooperate with the Police and other security agencies to enable them succeed in the responsibilities of safeguarding them and the commonwealth of the nation.
