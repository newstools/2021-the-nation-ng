The Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, on Saturday, said he had received with deep sorrow the news of the passing of a close ally, friend and associate, Prince Sam Obi, “whose stewardship to Delta State and Nigeria over many years had been with great distinction.” Senator Omo-Agege in a statement in Abuja said: “I am profoundly shocked by the sudden death of Prince Sam Obi, former Speaker of Delta State House of Assembly and former Acting Governor of Delta State, a man who possessed one of the highest qualities of professional integrity throughout the course of his legislative career.” According to the Deputy President of the Senate, “Prince Sam Obi was a very dedicated, hardworking and committed friend and legislator for whom I have the deepest respect and admiration.” The Delta Central lawmaker said: “The passion with which Prince Sam Obi did his job accounted for his political success in life, making it possible for him to attain the pinnacle of excellence in his political career as Speaker of the State’s Assembly and later as Acting Governor of Delta State.” He described the late former Speaker and former Acting Governor as ”a man of very solid character, extra-ordinary administrator and a politician par excellence, who stood firmly for what he believed in.” The Deputy President of the Senate said he joined the family of late Prince Sam Obi in mourning the sad loss. He called for prayers for the state and the entire Obi family as they accept the will of the Almighty God, who determines the fate of everyone.
