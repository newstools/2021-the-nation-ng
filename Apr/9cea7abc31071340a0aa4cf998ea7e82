Paul Onuachu has been crowned the Goal King of Belgium after he banged 29 goals for Genk in the regular season, but the stats also show he is the best striker in Belgium, reports ScoreNigeria.com Onuachu has netted 29 goals in 33 league games, a goal shy of the record set by Wesley Sonck. He averaged 0.96 goal every 90 minutes, which translates to a goal per game. This makes Onuachu the sharpest striker in the Jupiler Pro League. After him, Kevin Denkey (Cercle Brugge, 0.73), Bas Dost (Club Brugge, 0.71), Thomas Henry (OH Leuven, 0.65) and Zinho Gano (KV Kortrijk, 0.64) follow at a respectable distance. He also proved to be the most efficient striker in Belgium this season â€“ 31%. In this regard he is ahead of Zinho Gano (KV Kortrijk, 30%), Loris Brogno (Beerschot, 30%) and Bas Dost (Club Brugge, 29%). On the other hand, with that ratio, Onuachu belongs to the Top 10 centre-forwards in the Top 5 leagues of Europe. These remarkable numbers mean the man Genk splashed out six million Euros to sign two years ago will now go for a jackpot.
