Former housemate of the Big Brother Naija show, Alex Asogwa, has said that her celebrity status makes her feel caged and rebellious. The reality show star said this during a Question and Answer session with her fans on her Instagram stories. “Caged, rebellious but strong-willed as I love my freedom and peace and I will protect it by doing me the right way,” she responded when asked how she feels being a celebrity. Alex further  advised some of her fans on relationships and matters of the heart when probed. A fan asked if it is right to marry while broke and she said “I believe everyone should strive to stand alone. A would-be-husband that’s very rich should check that you put in your best to not be broke and help you stand on your own even before marriage since he is rich. Never make up your mind or settle to depend on anyone.” She also said a relationship that doesn’t add up should not be allowed to graduate into marriage to avoid future regret.
