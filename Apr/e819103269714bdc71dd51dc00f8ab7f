Three persons have been killed in a clash between rival cult groups in Anambra State. The clash happened Wednesday afternoon at different locations in Awka, the state capital. One youth was killed in Umubele, while the other two were killed in Okpuno in Awka South council area. An eyewitness told The Nation that four young men alighted from a tricycle and opened fire on the boys at Okpuno. The incident at Umubele, according to a source, happened like a movie, sending residents scampering for safety. The source said, “Nobody is safe in Awka nowadays. These boys kill themselves on a daily basis, but the worst part of it is that policemen are helpless.” Police spokesman Ikenga Tochukwu confirmed the killings. He said, “It is an incident that involved suspected attack by rival cult groups. The victims were rushed to the hospital and confirmed dead by a medical doctor on arrival. “Meanwhile, the combined team of anti-cult operatives and divisional police personnel led by the DPO B Division Awka is right at the scene” An investigation was ongoing, Ikenga said.
