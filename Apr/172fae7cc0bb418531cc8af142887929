 The Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria, Patrick Akinwuntan has advocated the use of artificial intelligence to predict security threats and proffer solutions. Akinwuntan who made this assertion at a webinar themed, “Cyber threat Landscape: Financial services, 2021 and beyond.”organised by Information Security Society of Africa, Nigeria (ISSAN) on Tuesday, said as cyber-attacks continue to grow in intensity and frequency, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a game changer, stressing that the manual and semi-automated techniques of monitoring and responding to systems issues of the past are grossly inadequate to take care of the risk of the future. He regretted the renewed cyber attacks on businesses globally occasioned by new technology and Covid 19 pandemic, “Technology has evolved and has changed the way we operate. Covid 19 only further accelerated the adoption of technology. Artificial intelligence, automation, internet have all created the opportunities for business to unlock more values, but cyber threats have also increased both in complexity and volume,” adding that “The new normal of working from home has further exposed institutions to cyber-attacks and data breaches. Endpoints for remote access must be secured or else institutions are exposed to attack by mismanaged endpoint. There is also the aspect of insider threat and exposure of password.”  Further, Akinwuntan identified other threats faced by financial institutions and organisations across the world to include cloud security threats and supply chain attack, stressing that a breach on one vendor could have ripple effects on the organizations.
