A man who allegedly beat his wife to death following a breakfast misunderstanding has been taken into police custody in Niger State. Lawal Danladi, 20, reportedly fell out with his wife after she presented him a bowl of pap. The suspect told police that he did not like how his wife Zulai prepared the morning meal, and beat her because of it. He also said he did not expect his wife to die from the beating. “I never knew she would die,” he said. “It was just a misunderstanding over a mere pap and I did not know that when she fainted she would not wake up. I should never have beaten her. I regret my action.” Police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said the suspect admitted beating his wife until she fell into a coma, adding that she was confirmed dead when she was rushed to hospital.
