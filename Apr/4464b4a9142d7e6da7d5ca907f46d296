Rivers Security Council has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on all the 23 local government areas of the state with effect from Thursday following security scares. Governor Nyesom Wike, in a statewide broadcast, said the decision was taken after an exhaustive deliberation by the council at the Government House, Port Harcourt. The Governor recalled on 28th April 2021, the council, in consideration of the recent murderous attacks on security personnel in Ikwerre and Abua/Odual Local Government Areas, imposed a night-time curfew on all state land borders. The Governor, in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, said after a review of the present security situation, there were possibilities of further deadly attacks on hard and soft targets across the state. He said it became imperative for the state government to take further necessary measures to secure the state and safeguard lives and property. He said: “Accordingly, the State Security Council has, today, after exhaustive deliberation, decided and advised that a state wide curfew on human and vehicular movements be imposed as part of additional measures to prevent the faceless criminals from unleashing their deadly actions. “Consequently, a night curfew is hereby imposed on the entire 23 Local Government Areas of the State prohibiting any human and or vehicular movement within or any part of the State from 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. from today 29th April 2021 until further notice.” Wike emphasised the government took the decision with a singular intention to secure the state and guarantee the protection of lives and property. The Governor urged everyone in the state to be vigilant and promptly report every suspicious movement in their neighbourhood to the security agencies for immediate actions.
