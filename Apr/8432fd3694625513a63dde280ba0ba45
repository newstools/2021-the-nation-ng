The 1981 set of Loyola College Ibadan, will celebrate 40 years of leaving school this year. In a press release issued in Lagos, Chairman of the 76/81 Set, Mr. Lookman Ismail, expressed gratitude to God for preserving the majority of the old boys, as well as the school – though he regretted the loss of a few of their classmates over the years. Ismail also lamented the dwindling fortunes of education in the country since the 70s when they were in school and called upon the government to partner with the private sector and old students to restore the glory of iconic institutions around the country. “It is really sad that many government and private institutions around the country are no more the reference points they used to be. And all this is because we have not yet prioritised education in Nigeria. “In some countries, teachers are paid better than bankers and education takes the lion share in federal budgetary allocations, we really need to reset our values in Nigeria,” he said. The Association called on the government to return the school to its original owner, the catholic church, which is able to run the schools well. “Loyola College Ibadan is one of the schools that should be returned to the Catholic Church, which founded the school in 1956 and laid a solid foundation for its excellence in academics, sports and discipline, “ he said. Events lined up for the anniversary include seminars, reunion dinner and the revamping of the school’s sports complex Ismail announced that the date of commencement of anniversary activities would be made public soon.
