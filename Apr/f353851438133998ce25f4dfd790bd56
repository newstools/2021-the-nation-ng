Motorists have been subjected to hardship as scarcity of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise known as petrol crept into Kaduna. The Nation observed many filling stations within the state capital were under lock and keys. The few ones selling within the metropolis, most of which belong to the major petroleum marketers, witnessed long queues. Within one kilometre radius of NEPA roundabout, only Mobil filling station on Independence way was selling fuel. Though, some filling stations in the outskirts of Kaduna metropolis were dispensing, a motorist, Mr. Benjamin Sunday, said some of the stations outside the city were selling above the approved pump price. Sunday said: “I suffered today before I could get to buy just N5,000 fuel. I was to travel to Katsina but I could not make the journey eventually because I could not get fuel on time. “On my from Zaria yesterday, I saw some filling stations dispensing fuel, so I wanted to buy but I was discouraged when I saw that they were selling at up to N175 naira per litre. “So, today, I decided to try Kachia road instead of joining queue in the town. I discovered they were also selling above the price. “So, I refused to buy because I am not even sure that, at that N172 to N175, I was getting at the right measurement. “So, I eventually came back to the town to join the queue where I spent hours before getting to buy just N5,000 fuel. Eventually, I could not make my journey because of the time I wasted looking for fuel.” Our correspondent observed the filling stations selling PMS within the Kaduna metropolis had not less than a kilometer queue.
