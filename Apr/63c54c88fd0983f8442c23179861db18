A firm Richlife Properties  has deployed crowd funding to help Nigerians have access to decent housing across Lagos and Ogun states, with plans to spread to the Southwest. Its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Bankole Babatunde, made this known at the weekend, during the unveiling of the firm’s product in Lagos called ‘Real Homes’and its first brand Ambassador, a Yoruba thespian, Bukunmi Oluwasina. He said Oluwasina was chosen  based on her social media followers of about 2.3 million fans. “Our new product requires crowd pulling and we realise that it has up to 2.3 million followers who are actually our target audience, especially the majority of Nigerians  who cannot own  land or houses of their own. ‘’She is free of scandals, her integrity is legitimate and we feel she is just right person for us,” Babatunde explained. On how the home scheme works, Bankole said: “It only requires a subscriber to deposit N60,000 for subscription of between 18 and 24 months’ repayment plan. You will be a proud owner of a two-bedroom apartment in any part of Nigeria that we have presence. It is a kind of crowd funding that we need the large number of our brand ambassador’s social media followers to sustain it.” According to him, the product is geared towards making housing affordable and accessible to millions of Nigerians who can neither afford to buy land nor house.
