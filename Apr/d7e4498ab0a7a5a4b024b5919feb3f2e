Rangers manager Steven Gerrard says he is “frustrated and angry” at social media companies about continued online abuse and hopes the club’s boycott will help bring about changes. On Thursday, Rangers announced a player and management team social media boycott in response to online abuse and discrimination. The club said they were concerned with the daily racist abuse their players have to endure, with captain James Tavernier telling Sky Sports News before the Old Firm game on March 21 every black player at the club has been abused on social media this season. Sky Bet Championship clubs Swansea City and Birmingham City also announced on Thursday they are boycotting social media for one week following a spate of “abhorrent” racial abuse on platforms. In his press conference ahead of Sunday’s Scottish Premiership fixture against Hibs, Gerrard said: “It’s been spoken about for long enough now, and it doesn’t seem like Instagram or Twitter or the social media outlets are taking any notice and they’re not listening. “I think the only way they will take note is if it goes above them. And probably the only people to do that are probably the governments.
