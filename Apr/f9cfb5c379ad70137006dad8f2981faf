The main opposition party All Progressive Congress (APC) in Bauchi state said It has rejected food items donated to it as palliatives Governor Bala Mohammed to cushion the effects of Ramadan. Our correspondent gathered the food items, which were conveyed to the party secretariat last Wednesday, include rice, maize, sugar ,spaghetti, sorghum and sugar. Mohammed’s benevolence was however turned down as the party insisted it is against its tradition to accept such from a Governor, who belongs to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). APC Publicity Secretary, Adamu Aliyu Jallah who confirmed the development to THE NATION said: ” We the working committee of the APC chapter rejected it because the problem is that if we collect this items there will be a different definition to it. “Secondly, last Ramadan, they did not bring it so why now? Besides there are workers who are yet to be paid their salaries. “They should give It to them, even if we are given 100 trailers of rice,it will still be rejected so it’s not about the quantity they brought it as Ramadan welfare to us.” He added ” They brought the leftovers of the COVID-19 palliative to our party secretariat around 1:00pm in the afternoon on Wednesday as Ramadan palliatives and those who brought it said it’s from Bauchi Governor but it’s against the tradition of our party. “We can’t collect anything from a rival party, therefore there is no reason for them to give us anything.” Bauchi PDP chairman, Alhaji Hamza Koshe Akuyam, said he was yet to ascertain why the food items were rejected when contacted.
