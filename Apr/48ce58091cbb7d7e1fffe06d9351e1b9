 William Troost-Ekong said promotion to the Premier League is up their as one of the absolute highs of a career that has included top-flight Italian football as well as the World Cup, the Olympics and the African Cup of Nations. “It’s amazing. I can’t really put words to it now,” said the Nigerian, speaking in the moments after Watford sealed promotion with a 1-0 win over Millwall. “It’s one of the best days in my life and in my career so far. We worked so hard for it and now we’ve done it, so I’m really pleased for all the boys.” Troost-Ekong sacrificed life in Serie A with Udinese for a chance of Premier League football, and the defender said it’s thanks to a combined effort from top to bottom that that dream has become reality. “Credit to everyone from the backroom staff, to the media staff, to the manager, to all the physios, to the owner, to everyone. It’s amazing and it’s been a team effort,” he said.  “A lot of the time when you have a relegation it’s difficult to pick yourselves up. Everyone at the club did amazing to give us the best chance and now we’re here, so we’re all really happy.” He added: “It’s crazy in there [the changing room]! I had to step out for a minute just to catch my breath. There’s a lot of partying and I think deservedly so. So much hard work has gone into this, so this is the pinnacle.” He added: “I think we have to enjoy it because you don’t get moments like this very often. At the start of the season everybody said we wanted to do it, but it’s one thing saying it and another thing actually doing it.” Coming from a family of Watford fans, Troost-Ekong made time during the celebrations for a FaceTime call with his loved ones. “I had a moment [with them] on the pitch. My phone’s been going crazy but that’s normal, I’m just trying to enjoy the moment,” he said. “My family home is bouncing and everyone’s having a massive party, so I can’t wait to get home and join in with that too.”
