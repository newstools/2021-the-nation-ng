Thierry Henry, Alan Shearer have been named as the first players inducted into the official Premier League Hall of Fame in recognition of a combined 435 goals and seven Golden Boot awards. Arsenal’s all-time top scorer Henry won two Premier League titles under Arsene Wenger and was part of the “Invincibles” team that went unbeaten throughout the 2003⁄04 title-winning campaign. France’s record goal scorer and 1998 World Cup winner scored more than 20 Premier League goals in five consecutive seasons between 2001/02 and 2005/06. “To be inducted alongside Alan Shearer as the two first inductees into the Premier League Hall of Fame is more than special,” said Henry. Alan Shearer scored 260 Premier League goals for Blackburn and Newcastle “When I was young, I was just trying to make sure I could get a pair of boots and now we’re talking about the Hall of Fame.” Shearer, who won the title with Blackburn in 1995, is the Premier League’s record goal scorer, netting 260 goals in 14 seasons for Blackburn and Newcastle.
