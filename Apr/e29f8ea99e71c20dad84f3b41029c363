Transformative change approach has been described as key in curbing Violence Against Women and girls.(VAWG). Speaking at a One-Day Training for CSOs to strengthen coordination mechanisms of stakeholders organised by Spotlight Initiative and held at Sheraton hotel, Ikeja, Lagos, the Executive Director, Women for Peace & Gender Equality Initiatives (WOPEGGE) Mojisola Akinsanya, said  it is one of the sustainable solutions in ending gender based violence. According to her this approach cannot be one sided rather all strata beginning with individuals must be ready to end VAWG. “These collective approach entails how women can form coalitions among themselves, sensitising policy makers, political class, security sector, religious institutions, communities,  thereby creating a strong and innovative approach to end gender based violence” said Akinsanya. Speaking further, “It is also important to catch the boy and the girl child young by training them on emotional empathy, self esteem, abstinence, among others, through their curriculum. The menace has been on going for years, but we need a sustainable solutions to end it, hence the reason we came up with transformative approach.
