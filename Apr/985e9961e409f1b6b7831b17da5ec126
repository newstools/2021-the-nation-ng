Kelechi Iheanacho is just one goal away from reaching a new personal goal scoring record in a single Premier League season. Iheanacho has eight goals in the English top-flight this season, which is the same number he managed in the 2015/2016 campaign. However, with seven matches left for Leicester City this season, the Nigerian international is well on course to set a new personal best this season. He could well break the record he set in the 2015/2016 season if he scores in Leicester’s clash against West Brom tonight. His previous best scoring season was in the 2015/2016 season, which saw him score 14 times in all competitions for Manchester City. Meanwhile, Sam Allardyce believes West Brom must stop one of the Premier League’s best strike partnerships in Jamie Vardy and Kelechi Iheanacho to keep their survival hopes alive. Vardy and Iheanacho have scored 29 goals between them this season as Leicester have climbed to third place in the Premier League and reached their first FA Cup final since 1969. Iheanacho scored his 15th  goal of the season as Southampton were 1-0 beaten in Sunday’s semi-final, with the in-form Nigeria striker set up by the seemingly-ageless Vardy. “We’ve got to look after maybe the best pairing in the Premier League at the moment,” West Brom boss Allardyce said ahead of Albion’s trip to Leicester today.  Iheanacho and Vardy are probably two of the most dangerous forwards in the Premier League. Part of our task is to try and keep them from scoring a goal and making sure we give ourselves a chance of winning the game.
