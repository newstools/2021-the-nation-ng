Of the 1884 inmates who escaped during a jailbreak in Imo State on April 5, some 122 have found their way back to the correctional centre, while 1762 have yet to return. Prison sources told The Nation on Sunday that inmates involved in murder, kidnap and armed robbery cases were still at large. “Only few with genuine cases have returned. You know anybody with a bad case such as armed robbery or kidnapping will find it difficult to return. Inmates jailed whose sentences had gone far are among those who have returned so far,” the source said. Meanwhile, it was gathered that there may likely be a shakeup at the Owerri Custodial service centre following the near completion of the investigation carried out by NCS, Abuja to ascertain the immediate and remote causes of the jailbreak.
