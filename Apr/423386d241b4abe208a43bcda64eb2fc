Rivers State Commissioner of Sports, Boma Iyaye, says Team Rivers’ ambition is to better last Festival’s performance. Speaking after the opening ceremony on Tuesday, Iyaye who came to cheer the team to victory praised Edo State for a befitting opening ceremony. “First I want to commend the government of Edo State for a wonderful job, it was an awesome event considering several postponements of the festival. I think they did a very good job,” he said. “Our ambition is to win, but at the end of the day we will be able to ascertain if that is possible or not.” Team Rivers placed second at the 19th National Sports Festival behind Delta State with 69 gold, 58 silver and 67 bronze medals, while Edo came third with 47 gold, 41 silver and 53 bronze medals. The Commissioner remained optimistic that the state will add to her medals and be in a good position while lamenting the absence of fans due to the restrictions occasioned by the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 Pandemic.
