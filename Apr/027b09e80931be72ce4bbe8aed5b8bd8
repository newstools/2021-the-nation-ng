The Nigeria Interreligious Council (NIREC), under the joint leadership of President, Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Samson Ayokule and the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, has urged Christians and Muslims embrace peace and tolerance. According to a statement issued on Wednesday by NIREC’s Executive Secretary, Prof. Cornelius Omonokhua, on behalf of the two religious bodies not to expect gain without some levels of pain. Christians last week completed the Lenten season. Muslims this week commenced the Ramadan fast. The CAN President and Sultan of Sokoto reminded their followers that pain was a stepping stone to growth. They pleaded with Nigerians to show more understanding and forgive one another as, according to them, nothing good comes easy even for nations. The statement reads: “Lent and Ramadan are holy seasons of fasting, abstinence, almsgiving, works of mercy and forgiveness. In the spirit of these sacred seasons, let us pray for the courage to forgive each other and one another. “The message from fasting, abstinence and alms-giving is no pain, no gain. Pain is a stepping stone to growth. May these seasons empower Nigeria to grow from grass to grace.”
