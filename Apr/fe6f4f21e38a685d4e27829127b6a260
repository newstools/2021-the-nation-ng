Simeon Nwankwo continued his rich vein of form in front of goal when he smashed home his 16th goal in the Italian Serie A. ‘Simy’ tucked away a penalty in the 68th minute for Crotone to draw level with visitors Udinese. It was his seventh penalty goal of the season. However, Crotone again lost 2-1 and they remain rooted to the basement of the Italian top flight with a mere 15 points from 31 matches. A quick return to the Italian lower league looks likely for them after another round of matches.
