The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Lagos State Council, has disassociated itself from the fracas that occurred at Iyana-Iba, outskirts of Lagos on Monday. Its Secretary, Comrade Seyi Bankole, said officials of the union at Iyana-Iba were summoned and they made it known to the state leadership that they were not involved in the crisis. The Nation learnt that two persons were feared killed and many injured in the crisis. Hoodlums were seen damaging vehicles and other properties in the crisis that lasted several hours. Bankole appealed to Lagosians and media to always verify the information before ascribing any transportation crisis to the NURTW. According to him, there are other transport unions operating in the state. “Our members were not involved in the melee. We have warned our officials at different levels not to involve in the fracas. Anyone caught would be sanctioned and handed over to the police. What happened on Monday was between other transport unions. It’s unfortunate that people ascribe any transportation matter to the NURTW not knowing that there are other unions in the transportation sector aside NUTTW,” he said.
