World number one freestyle wrestler in 57 kg, Odunayo Adekuroye, has set her sights firmly on winning gold for Nigeria at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics this summer in Tokyo, Japan. Adekuroye, who won her sixth consecutive African championship crown in February last year, added that her preparations towards making history are on course in Tokyo, using the ongoing 20th National Sports Festival as part of her final events before the Games starts in July. “I am going to Tokyo with the sole aim of winning the gold,” Adekuroye said. “The Sports Festival is part of my preparations for the Olympics and I would like to thank the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare for ensuring we have the festival despite several postponements occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,” she added. The multiple medalists also hailed Daniel Igali, the chairman of Nigeria Wrestling Federation for his immense contributions to the development of Wrestling in Nigeria. “Our chairman has been a God-sent and his presence and contribution have been very impactful,” She said. “Wrestling has become a major sport Nigerians are looking at for medals at the Olympics and we shall, by the grace of God make history by winning medals at the Tokyo Olympics.”
