Cristiano Ronaldo spared Juventus’ blushes and gave boss Andrea Pirlo a reprieve with a late equaliser as the Derby della Mole with Torino finished 2-2. Federico Chiesa broke the deadlock in the 13th-minute, racing onto an Alvaro Morata flick-on and finishing between the legs of Salvatore Sirigu, as the Old Lady started brightly. However, Torino – who may have had a penalty for Matthijs de Ligt’s challenge on Andrea Belotti – grabbed a deserved equaliser on 27 minutes through Antonio Sanabria, who pounced after a goalkeeping error from Wojciech Szczesny, as an entertaining first-half ended 1-1. And just 13 seconds into the second period, Juventus found themselves trailing in the game after Dejan Kulusevski gave up possession straight from kick-off. Sanabria took full advantage for his brace, firing past Szczesny, who despite getting a hand to the shot couldn’t keep it out. But Ronaldo came to the rescue with a headed equaliser in the 79th-minute, which was given by VAR after the goal was initially chalked off for offside. Juventus hammered on the door in search of a winner in the dying stages, with Rodrigo Bentancur striking the post, but ultimately, they had to settle for a point.
