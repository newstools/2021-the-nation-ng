Police in Bayelsa State have arrested a 35-year-old woman, Mrs Priye Richman, for allegedly inflicting life-threatening injuries with razor blades on her teenage daughter, Tokoye, over alleged theft of N1,500. Police apprehended Mrs Richman in Okutukutu, Yenagoa council area of the state. The suspect, who sells locally-made bread, popularly known as ‘Madiga’, allegedly tied her daughter and slashed every part of her body with razor blades. It was gathered that the victim was operated on by doctors at the Police hospital located behind the ‘A’ Division Police Station. It was also gathered that Tokoye, a 13-year-old girl, was brought in by the members of the girl-child advocacy groups made up of the DO Foundation, Izon Ladies Association (ILA) and Gender Response Initiative Team (GRIT) with multiple lacerations. Over 15 stiches were reportedly carried out on the injuries. Narrating her ordeal, the victim said: “My mother came back around 12 pm on Sunday, after church, and accused me of stealing her N1,500. I told her I didn’t see the money. She did not believe and started beating me. She tied me with ropes and slashed all parts of my body with razor blades. She later rubbed pepper and kerosene on the injuries.” She said it was a neighbour who pushed down the door, rescued her and called the girl-child advocacy groups who took charge and arrested her mother and handed her to the police. Police spokesman Asinim Butswat confirmed the development.
