The NWFL Premiership Super Six would presumably  end in a photo finish with four teams namely  Rivers Angels, Delta Queens, Sunshine Queens and FC Robo, having  equal chances of emerging champions on Sunday ; and also securing the country’s representative to the WAFU B qualifiers for the CAF Women Champions League this year. All the four clubs must win their last games against themselves at the Dipo Dina International Stadium Ijebu-Ode on Sunday. At the end of the Match Day 4 games at the Dipo Dina International Stadium Ijebu-Ode, the teams from Delta and Rivers emerged the top contenders with eighy points each from  four  matches each has  played so far.  At the end of matches yesterday and going into the final games on Sunday, both Rivers Angels and  Delta Queens have eight points while both Sunshine Queens and FC Robo are on seven points. To win the title on Sunday , Rivers Angels  must beat Sunshine Queens ditto for Delta Queens in their last match against FC Robo. The Bayelsa Queens versus Edo Queens game, will also be a tough cracker as the two team will be playing for pride. Bayelsa Queens have 2points going into the last game, while Edo Queens have zero points from four matches.
