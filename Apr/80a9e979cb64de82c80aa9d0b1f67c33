The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, has rejoiced with the Chairman of the Police Service Commission (PSC), Alhaji Musiliu Adeola Kunbi Smith, as the elder statesman clocks 75 years. Gbajabiamila, who described Smith as one of the foremost police officers Nigeria has produced, said the former Inspector-General of Police (IGP) has become a role model to many. He said as a Lagosian, Alhaji Musiliu Smith displayed high professionalism throughout his years of public service, which culminated in his appointment as the IGP in May, 1999. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, he said the period in which Smith served as IGP saw the repositioning of the Nigeria Police Force to meet the challenges of that time. Gbajabiamila noted with delight how Smith served committedly as the Chairman of the Skye Bank Board of Directors in 2006 and the Chairman of Lagos State Security Council in 2007. The Speaker urged the current crop of policemen and women to follow the footsteps of the likes of Smith, whom he said made the Nigeria Police proud during his days. Gbajabiamila also expressed satisfaction at the way Alhaji Smith has been handling the affairs of the Police Service Commission since his appointment as the Chairman for almost three years now. “Today is a special day for a foremost elder statesman, Alhaji Musiliu Smith. I congratulate the chairman of the PSC for marking this day in good health. “The people of Lagos State and indeed Nigeria are proud of you. One can only wish you good health and protection from the Almighty Allah,” Gbajabiamila said. Born on April 17, 1946, Musliu Smith was the 10th Inspector General of Police (IGP) between May, 1999 and March, 2002.
