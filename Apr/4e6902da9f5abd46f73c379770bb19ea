Deyemi is an actor. He interprets roles. He acts and is committed to his arts,” Nollywood actress Yvonne Jegede said while lauding her colleague, Deyemi Okanlawon. The encomiums came from Jegede following mixed reactions over Deyemi’s performance in a clip from the upcoming film, Honeymoon Palava. The short clip had Deyemi coming out of the bathroom almost naked. Continuing, the mother of one, who acted alongside Deyemi in the film said, “Arts are real, so acting should be closed to reality. He is acting coming out of the bathroom after a warm bath, do people expect him to come out fully kitted? This is a movie, it is make-believe. I will instead commend him for being a very good actor and a good professional.” Yvonne went on to say that a large portion of the reactions that greeted the clip of Deyemi’s character almost naked is unnecessary. ‘Honeymoon Palava,’ which features Deyemi Okanlawon, Yvonne Jegede, Ufuoma Mcdermott, Prince Jide Kosoko, Lateef Adedimeji, Bimbo Thomas, Nkechi Blessing Sunday, and Bianca Ugowanne, tells the story of a new couple who got caught up in a nightmarish series of events 48 hours after their wedding in a hotel.
