Suspected gunmen have killed a police officer identified as Inspector Musa, burnt the police patrol van and carted away his AK-47 in Ashaka Community, Ndokwa East local government Area of Delta State. It was learnt the gunmen on motorbikes attacked three policemen of Ashaka Division stationed in front of Matar-Dei Grammar School gate around 4:30 am. It was gathered the patrol team leader, Inspector Musa, was killed on the spot while the other two sustained various degrees of injuries. A source, who pleaded anonymity, said he overheard one of the policemen shouting: “They have killed me ooh.” Another source from Ashaka vigilante group said that the attackers were passersby whom he described as criminals targeting police rifles. Efforts to reach the Ashaka Divisional Police officer (DPO) or the Police Public Relations Officer for comments proved abortive.
