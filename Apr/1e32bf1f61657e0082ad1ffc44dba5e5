Tiwa disclosed this in an interview with Allure Magazine where she revealed the difficulties and struggles she faced in embracing herself. She described how difficult it was for her to fit in with her white friends when she was a teenager. She said she combined creams with lemon in an attempt to bleach her skin, but her mother discovered the mixture while cleaning her room and was more disappointed in her than she was upset. According to the Afro-beats singer, she revealed she still has patches on her back as a result of her attempt to alter her skin colour. Tiwa Savage made this revelation when she was featured on the cover of this month’s issue of the magazine. The former Mavin Records Label queen also stated she now has a platform and digging more into her responsibility for younger people. According to the mother of one, when she started her career, she wasn’t embracing who she was fully yet because she was just trying to crack into the market. Tiwa added that her two singles were very American and wasn’t very African. But then, as time went on, she just started seeing how powerful her platform was and how mothers would say, “My little girl really looks up to you”.
