Lagos and Edo teams showed their class against the rest of the country to emerge champions in the men and women team event of badminton at the 20th National Sports Festival taking place in Benin City. It was the Edo ladies that claimed the first gold medal in badminton with the Deborah Ukeh Divine led team defeating their Ogun counterpart led by Nigeria’s female number one player, Dorcas Adesokan. It was an easy passage for the Edo team as they overpowered Delta state 2-0 in the semifinal, while Ogun defeated Kwara with the same margin in the second semifinal. However, Delta had to settle for the bronze medal after beating Kwara. Lagos’ duo of Anuolowapo Opeyori and Godwin Olufia showed their class against their Delta counterpart in the men’s team final with a 2-0 win to clinch the second gold medal for the state. They had on Monday defeated FCT Abuja 2-0 in the quarterfinal and went ahead to edge out Rivers in the semi-final. However, Head Coach of Lagos State Badminton Association, Maria Omonehin has said that Lagos is poised to dominate the badminton event in Edo.
