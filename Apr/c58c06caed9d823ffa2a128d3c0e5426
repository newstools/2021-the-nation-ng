The Police have cordoned off the valley where several decapitated and decomposed bodies were discovered on Tuesday in the outskirts of Calabar, capital of Cross River State. Police Commissioner Sikiru Akande also kept mum on the incident. The CP on Wednesday rather expressed displeasure to some journalists over how the reports were approached, insinuating they were written to aggravate feelings of insecurity in the State. Akande had feigned ignorance of the incident the previous day and when told that some Police personal in camouflage have cordoned off the place he retorted that “policemen do not wear camouflage on Tuesdays”. He later visited the scene of the incident but refused to speak about it. Spokesman of the Cross River State Command of the Nigeria Security and Defense Corps, Mr Ereni had confirmed eight decapitated and decomposed bodies were found in the valley. He said the bodies were those of one female and seven men. Some locals suspected the corpses could have been victims of extrajudicial killings but Permanent Secretary office of State Security Adviser, Governor’s Office Alfred Mboto, denied the speculation. The corpses were reportedly discovered by farmers in the area with men in police camouflage seen alongside rescuers dragging out some bodies, including that of a middle-aged woman from the valley. Some Okada riders at the scene claimed it was the second time in two months corpses were discovered in the same area.
