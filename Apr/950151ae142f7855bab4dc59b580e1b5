Vice Chancellor of the Maranatha University, Mgbidi, Oru West Council Area, Imo State, Prof. Ogwu Ogwu, has advocated for an academic curriculum that would mould students intellectually and spiritually in tertiary institutions across the country. This, he said, is the basis of character formation which, if adopted, would stem the rising tide of all forms of immorality ravaging institutions. He promised to visit all the traditional rulers of the area to sensitise them on the issue. Ogwu, a former VC of the Abia State University,  stated this at a thanksgiving service of the varsity which featured a short message with the theme: “The light has come” and corporate prayers by the Presiding Bishop of Praise Centre Church International, Bishop Stafford Nwaogu. He noted that as a faith-based institution, his administration would do its best to move it to greater heights in the face of older academic establishments. Proprietor and member, Board of Trustees (BOT) of the institution, Pastor Grace Ngubo, explained that the  university  was poised to provide basic academic programmes that would improve  skills and abilities of students. She regretted that many youths acquire education without morality and the fear of God, and warned that the future would be bleak if this is left unchecked. “Ours is to produce graduates imbued with the fear of God and who will be internationally acceptable to compete favourably with their counterparts all over the world,” she said. The chancellor and chairman, BOT of the institution, Rev. Chukwuemeka Ngubo, announced an immediate full four-year scholarships for the first three indigenes of the area to be admitted into the institution.
