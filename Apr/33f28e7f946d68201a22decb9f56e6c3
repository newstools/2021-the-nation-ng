A group, Public and Private Development Center (PPDC) Abuja, has expressed satisfaction over the positive impacts its monitoring interventions were making in various communities across the country. The Program Officer, Nonye Akubuo, stated this in Awka, Anambra state during a stakeholder roundtable/engagement on improving service delivery in the state. She said the group in collaboration with local partners had not only compelled government institutions to sit up to their responsibilities but succeeded in closing existing gaps within the procurement processes. She said: “We’re trying to strengthen community actions for improved service delivery. So many projects are littered around and we’re trying to ensure there’s value for money as well as judicious spending in the procurement processes. “Our desire is for the common man in the rural communities to have access to quality health care, basic education, good roads, water, and other basic infrastructures. “We don’t just monitor, we have an open contracting portal, one of which we deployed to Anambra state. Procurement data are generated from the portal to monitor the projects. “We are glad our impact is being felt across the country through our various engagements including radio programmes as well as toll-free lines through which we get feedback from the localities. “We’re excited that government is sitting up to its responsibilities as abandoned projects are being revived while several others are being implemented. We also take up with the lawmakers especially on constituency projects.” Chairman, Anambra State Civil Society Network, Prince Chris Azor regretted the increasing level of corruption across the country which he blamed on lacuna in quality service delivery. He appreciated the PPDC for providing the state with a portal of international standards on e-procurement for accountability and transparency of government programmes.
