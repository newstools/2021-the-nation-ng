Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Tuesday swore in Chukwuma Frank Ibezim as the senator representing Imo North Senatorial District. The Clerk to the Senate, Ibrahim El-Ladan, administered the oath of office and allegiance on Ibezim. “With this oath-taking, the Imo North Senatorial District is fully represented,” Lawan said. The Supreme Court had last Friday set aside the disqualification of Ibezim as the authentic candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the December 5, 2020 Imo North Senatorial bye-election. Justice Emmanuel Agim had in a unanimous judgment held that the suit, which led to Ibezim’s disqualification for allegedly supplying false information to secure nomination, was statute-barred at the time it was instituted. The suit was filed by Asomugha Elebeke, one of the aspirants, who had expressed interest to contest the party’s primary for the bye-election.
