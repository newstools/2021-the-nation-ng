HAVING postponed his debut solo album three times, Mr P has finally opened up on why it took so long before the album was finally released. The former member of the defunct group ‘P’Square,’ released his first-ever solo album, The Prodigal on April 1. The album was heralded with a virtual concert that had Tiwa Savage, Teni, Wande Coal, Tamar Braxton featuring on it. During a media tour, Mr P revealed that unforeseen circumstances made him postpone the album release three times. “I wanted to release the album on my birthday last year but before I could announce, myself and my family caught COVID-19 so we had to stop,” he said. “The second time I was going to release the album, Endsars came, and not only that but my DJ, who was there with me from day one, DJ Switch, went on exile, and releasing an album in such a situation wouldn’t be nice. I’m not comfortable releasing an album when she’s on the run so I postponed it to January 2021 and all of a sudden I lost my father-in-law again. When that happened I just decided to give enough time. “One good thing is the wait was worth it. The last time I felt this way was almost twenty years ago.” Shedding light on the choice of the album title, Mr P said The Prodigal means something entirely different from its regular meaning. He noted that he is only trying to modify the meaning of Prodigal. “People misquoted me because of the album title. The Prodigal is different from the prodigal son. I am trying to redefine it, it is more like someone independent and successful.”
