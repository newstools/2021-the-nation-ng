Kidney failure occurs when your kidneys stop working and can no longer do their job. Your kidneys filter waste and extra fluid out of your blood so they can be removed from your body through urine. If you think you might have kidney disease, it’s important to see your doctor for evaluation. Getting an early diagnosis and treatment can help slow the progression to kidney failure. 1. High blood pressure and diabetes are the most common causes of kidney failure. Many of the prevention tips are related to managing these two conditions. Diabetes increases your risk for heart disease and kidney failure. That’s just one reason to manage your blood sugar. High blood pressure can increase your risk for heart disease as well as kidney failure. Obesity can increase your risk for conditions associated with kidney failure, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. A heart-healthy diet — one low in sugar and cholesterol and high in fiber, whole grains, and fruits and vegetables — helps prevent weight gain. Eating too much of salt is associated with high blood pressure. Dehydration reduces blood flow to your kidneys, which can damage them. Ask your doctor how much water you should drink per day. Alcohol increases your blood pressure. The extra calories in it can make you gain weight, too. Smoking reduces blood flow to your kidneys. It damages kidney function in people with or without kidney disease. In high doses, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, reduce the amount of blood flow to your kidneys, which can harm them. Reducing stress and anxiety can lower your blood pressure, which is good for your kidneys. Exercises such as swimming, walking, and running, can help reduce stress, manage diabetes and high blood pressure, and maintain a healthy weight.
