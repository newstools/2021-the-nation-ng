MUSIC artist and UNICEF Nigeria Ambassador Cobhams Asuquo have called on Nigerians to have confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and ensure children receive their routine immunisations to prevent deadly diseases. The call was made as the world celebrated World Health Day. Cobhams joined Angelique Kidjo, Calema, Magic System, and Safiath in sensitizing fans and the general public on the need to be vaccinated. According to Cobhams Asuquo, all hands must be on deck in the fight against COVID-19. “Vaccines have been saving the lives of Nigerians and children for many years – and we have to make sure they continue to. Thanks to vaccines, I know that my children will not have to suffer from polio, measles, or smallpox. Thanks to vaccines, I know that I will not end up in the hospital with COVID-19 – leaving my family on their own. That is because vaccines work. They save lives. “As Nigerians and as Africans, we have gone through too much to let this virus hold us back and endanger our futures that we are fighting so hard to make better. We need to do whatever we can to safeguard our future,” said Cobhams. In the same vein, Benin-born singer and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Angelique Kidjo, said: “I am here to tell you that vaccines save lives. As a child, I was vaccinated and I will get immunised against COVID-19 when the vaccine becomes available to me”. The artists united with UNICEF to promote confidence in COVID-19 vaccines one month after the start of the historic roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in several West and Central African countries. The important call came in response to record levels of vaccine misinformation sweeping the region, risking efforts to control the global pandemic.
