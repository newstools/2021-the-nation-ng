Former Speaker of Delta State House of Assembly, Victor Ochei has expressed deep grief over the demise of former speaker and acting Governor Sam Obi. In a statement, Ochei who is the Executive Director, Maritime Labour and Cabotage Services at NIMASA, observed  that, though  Obi’s passage came as a rude shock, it underscores the inevitability of death as a mortal obligation. He said unpalatable development has robbed Delta State, Nigeria and humankind of a seasoned legislator who represented the Ika Northeast constituency, pragmatic administrator as an acting governor of the state and an accomplished statesman. According to him: “As a fellow debutant legislator  at the Delta state legislature 2003 through 2015, Rt Hon Obi was literally a round character of immense and infectious personality- humble, peaceful, compassionate, kind,  decisive; all alluring attributes that made him a source of inspiration in diverse endeavours. While praying for the repose Obi’s soul, he  urged the immediate family, acolytes and contemporaries of the late law maker and pastor to find solace in the fact that during his earthly sojourn, he exhibited  utmost commitment to the Lord’s vineyard in his capacity as founder and pastor of the Asaba based Oracle of God Ministry.
