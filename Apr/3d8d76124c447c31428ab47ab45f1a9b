From Mino Raiola paying a visit to his old friend, Joan Laporta, to the latest development on Messi’s renewal as reported by Eurosport, today was an eventual day in Barcelona. Reportedly, the Argentine has handed in his list of demands to renew his Barca contract. It’s a known fact that Leo will be a free agent on June 1, 2020. However, no club has contacted him regarding his future. In recent days, the Barca captain is looking more settled and happy. This indicates that there are chances that he might renew his contract, something which nobody could have imagined after the burofax scandal.  The Argentine’s prime concern during the Bartomeu administration was the lack of a plan. So, this time around, he wants a commitment from Joan Laporta to build a squad that can win it all. He understands the precarious financial condition of the club but insists on at least one marquee signing. It has been reported previously that after some cleaning up, Barca can complete a marquee signing.
