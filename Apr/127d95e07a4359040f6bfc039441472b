The Federal Government has received another batch of 418 returnees from Saudi Arabia. This brings to 1,071 the number of Nigerians evacuated from the Holy Land within the last three days. It does not include the about 1,000 Nigerians evacuated in January 2021. Leading the inter-governmental agencies to receive the returnees, Amb. Bolaji Akinremi, Director, Consular and Legal Department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said 255 and 398 returnees arrived Nigeria on Monday and Tuesday respectively. Akinremi said the reintegration exercise was made possible through the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, to create a smooth rehabilitation process for the returnees. According to him, the rapid testing method for Covid-19 detection was carried out while the returnees were profiled into states and gender. As against previous arrangement where each of them will stay in the camp for seven to 14 days , he said the maximum number on camp is three days before they are released to join their families. He assured the returnees that the accommodation at the camp has the basic amenities which include a 24-hour medical service to look into the welfare of the returnees before they join their families.
