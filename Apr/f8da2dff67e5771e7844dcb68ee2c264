Mavins’ record boss and music producer, Don Jazzy has revealed reasons for remaining single after being in the public eye for over a decade. In an Instagram post, the former co-owner of defunct Mo’Hits records explained how music had deprived him of settling down to enjoy marital bliss.  “Music became priority instead of my family,” Don Jazzy remarked. Explaining how his love and passion for making music ended his two-year marriage, Don Jazzy expressed guilt and regret for failing to keep his marriage and leaving his ex-wife, whom he referred to as a wonderful soul he loved. “For so long everyone keeps asking me when am I getting married? Well the truth is almost 18 years ago I was 20 and I got married to my best friend Michelle @yarnstaswitch and it was beautiful. I loved love and I loved marriage. Michelle is soooo beautiful inside and outside with such a soft heart. But then me being so young and full of dreams I went and fucked it up cos I was giving all my time to my Music. We got divorced when I was 22 and it hurt. I am still very much in love with my music and I wouldn’t want to marry another and fuck it up again. So I’m taking my time. Why am I just saying this now?” The hit creator also hinted at why he decided to open up on his failed marriage and how his love for music had deprived him of love. “I really like to keep my relationships private actually. Past or present. But I was watching the bounce interview with Ebuka which is almost like a tell-all interview, and I felt bad skipping this huge part of my life. So yeah make una no vex o.”
