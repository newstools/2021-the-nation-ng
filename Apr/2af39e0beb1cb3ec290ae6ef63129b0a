 Three construction workers abducted last Tuesday in Ondo State have been released. The three men work in the construction firm handling the 16km Ikaram-Akunu-Akoko Highway. Work on the road has slowed down since last week as other workers were scared of resuming work.  The abducted workers were freed on Saturday night, police said, but it was not confirmed if any ransom was paid. A source said they were taken to an undisclosed hospital for medical checkup. Police spokesman ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro confirmed the release of the workers.
