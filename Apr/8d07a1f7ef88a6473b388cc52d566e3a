The Consumer Protection Council (CPC) on Sunday confiscated fake and expired goods valued over N1 billion in Kano State. The agency said it arrested 13 suspects and secured nine arrest warrants to trail those on the run but have left their fake and or expired goods in their warehouses. Acting Managing Director of the Council, Baffa Babba Dan’agundi, who briefed reporters on Sunday, said most of the seizures were made at Sabongari and Singer markets. He added that the fake products were confiscated within the last three months. It was gathered those arrested were pleading for plea bargain, which Dan’agundi said is allowed in law. “However, such offenders have to agree to forfeit the goods confiscated from them and as well pay the fine imposed by the court before they would be allowed to go,” he said. He explained the fake items, including drugs, confiscated from the nine suspects on the run, cannot be burnt until they are apprehended and charged to court. He expressed delight the relocation of luxury buses out of Sabon Gari area to the outskirt of the state capital city has drastically reduced the inflow of fake and expired goods.
