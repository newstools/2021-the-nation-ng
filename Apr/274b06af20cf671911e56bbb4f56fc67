Latest report from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has revealed that COVID-19 testing across states in the past week (March 22nd to 28th, 2021) decreased significantly, as 15 states tested a total of 578 samples in one week. More worrisome is the fact that each of the states tested less than 100 samples. Similarly, new cases of COVID-19 have also dropped from 1,080 two weeks ago, to 856 last week, with 18 deaths recorded in the same week. States like Lagos, FCT, Rivers, and Kaduna tested 10,765; 6,831; 3456; and 2,892 samples respectively in one week. Kogi, Kebbi, Ondo, Adamawa and Sokoto tested the least COVID-19 samples – 1, 3, 11, 13 and 13 respectively. According to the NCDC, as of March 28, 2021, “In week 12, the number of new confirmed cases decreased to 856 from 1,080 reported in week 11. These were reported in 29 states and FCT. The number of discharged cases decreased to 2,409 from 2,500 in week 11. These were reported in 23 states and FCT. “The number of reported deaths in the last one week in 5 states and FCT was 18.

But, the number of active COVID-19 cases in the country stands at 9,202, with confirmation of 50 new additional cases on April 3, the NCDC has said.
