Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has advocated for tolerance and religious harmony as a catalyst for peace, security and good governance in Nigeria. Lalong spoke on Thursday at the installation and reception of Pallium by the new Catholic Archbishop of Jos Most. Revd Dr Matthew Ishaya Audu held at the Divine Mercy Cathedral, Lamingo Jos. While congratulating the Archbishop, the Governor said within one year of assuming duties, His Grace Most. Rev Matthew Audu has demonstrated that his calling is divine and that he is totally committed to ensuring that the will of God is implemented in Plateau State and the world at large through the Church. The Governor said: “While it is the duty of religious leaders to speak the truth to power and the public, you should also beware of, and shun rhetoric that promotes hate, division, and distrust among the people. “You should guard against politicians and other interests that are always desperate to exploit the pulpit for their selfish reasons.” Apostolic Nuncio to Nigeria Most Revd Anthonio Fillipazzi said the presentation of the Pallium to the Archbishop is a significant event that confers authority on the Archbishop to discharge his duties in line with the doctrine of the Catholic Church. He called for prayers for Archbishop Audu. Gbong Gwom Jos, Da Jacob Gyang Buba also congratulated the Archbishop and promised the support of the traditional institution to the Church and the government. Archbishop Audu thanked God for bestowing on him this assignment which he intends to do his best to discharge. He thanked His Holiness Pope Francis for the installation.
