Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has said Christian Pulisic will be a “huge weapon” for the club if he overcomes the physical and confidence issues affecting his form. The United States international has struggled for game-time during an injury-affected campaign, starting just four matches since Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard as head coach in late January. Pulisic has suffered with lingering hamstring problems ever since sustaining the original injury in last year’s FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal. He was substituted in last weekend’s 5-2 defeat to West Brom at half-time — after scoring in the first half — after feeling he was at risk of aggravating the issue if he played on. Pulisic is under contract at Stamford Bridge until 2024 but has been linked with a move away if he continues to be a peripheral figure in west London.
