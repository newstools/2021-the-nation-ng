Kaduna chapter of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has subjected all its local government chairmanship aspirants to written examination and oral interview. The examination and interview, which lasted for hours at state capital on Wednesday, were superintended by 17-man panel including four Professors, several PhD holders and lawyers. This is the first time in history of Kaduna State such exercise would be conducted to screen political party aspirants. When The Nation visited Stonehedge Hotel, venue of the examination and screening, over 100 aspirants were seen going through the process. One of the aspirants said the exercise was thorough as they were made to make photocopies of their credentials for the panelists, who took time to scrutinise them and ask probing questions. It was also gathered the aspirants were told to write biographical essay on their lives, schools attended, work experiences, places lived or visited within Kaduna state, Nigeria and abroad. The essence of the exercise, The Nation gathered, was to weed out those with questionable credentials and deficiencies that have the tendencies of exposing the party to post-election litigations. The Nation gathered all the incumbent local government chairmen are seeking reelection except chairman of Kachia Local Government Area.
