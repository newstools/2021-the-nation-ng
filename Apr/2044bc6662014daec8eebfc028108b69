ARSENAL defender David Luiz has been ruled out of Saturday’s Premier League clash with Liverpool. The Brazilian started each of the Gunners’ last four league games prior to the international break, as well as both legs of each of the club’s Europa League knockout ties. A club statement said: “David has experienced discomfort in his right knee and is being further assessed. “David will not be available for Saturday’s match.” The Brazilian’s absence leaves Mikel Arteta to choose between Gabriel, Pablo Mari and Rob Holding for his starters at centre-back. The latter picked up a thigh problem while on international duty with England U21s, while Saka was prevented from joining up with Gareth Southgate’s senior squad by a hamstring injury. “Bukayo will be assessed ahead of Saturday’s match regarding his availability,” the statement said.
