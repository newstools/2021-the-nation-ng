Two suspected robbers have been killed by a mob in Aba, Abia State’s commercial city. The lynch mob said the men had been terrorising the Ngwa Road area of Aba South Local Government Area of the state. Residents told our correspondent that the suspects were on a robbery operation in the Obohia area of the city when they were lynched. It was learnt that the residents resorted to self-help after calls to police yielded no fruit. A source said the suspected robbery pair robbed a man going to the bank with proceeds of a thrift. A third member of the gang was said to have fled on seeing his alleged partner apprehended. “The armed robbers attacked the son of a woman that collects thrift (akawo or Isusu) on Obohia Road who was apparently going to the bank to deposit the money that they collected for the day,” a resident told the reporter, the source said. “It was when they collected the money that the boy raised the alarm. People who saw them collecting the bag chased after them and caught one of them. “While he was being beaten, the other one came to rescue his colleague, but was caught also.”
