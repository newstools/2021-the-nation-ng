The American Petroleum Institute (API) and the African Energy Chamber (AEC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on capacity building initiatives and standardisation to enhance safety, environmental protection and sustainability in African countries producing natural gas and oil. “API is pleased to collaborate with the AEC to expand use of our world-class standards and programmes to help enhance the safety, transparency and sustainability of natural gas and oil operations across the African continent,” API Segment Standards and Services Vice President Alexa Burr said, adding: “This is our first partnership with an African based organisation, and we look forward to supporting AEC’s efforts to drive industry-wide technical knowledge.”The number of petroleum producing countries in Africa has increased substantially, coinciding with a movement across the continent to enact robust, equitable and imminently more transparent policies. This continent-wide pursuit to increase the technical capacity of local organisations is of paramount importance in these natural gas and oil economies. It will be vital for public and private representatives of African host economies to work with the international petroleum industry and help ensure the developmental needs of the local markets are met while maintaining policies that allow for oil sector investment in these economies and accelerating the adoption of industry practices that enhance safety and environmental protection. ”Our association with API is a milestone for the work we do, and we are confident we will see American ingenuity – a key component of the partnership between African producing nations and IOCs – at its best,” US-Africa committee Chair of the AEC Jude Kearney said.
