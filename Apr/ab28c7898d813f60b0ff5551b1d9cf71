The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has announced plans to train 250 cadets to man its various platforms in the Lagos-Bayelsa coastal corridor. The agency’s Director-General, Dr. Bashir Jamoh, made this known to reporters in Port Harcourt. Jamoh, who was represented by his Special Assistant on Communications and Strategy, Ubong Essien, at a news conference, said the exercise was part of the current drive to develop local capacity for improved operations. “So, the 250 cadets are about to be sent for training as part of our commitment to develop manpower to man our many platforms that are coming on stream soon. “We felt that we must develop our hands locally, which will have ripple effects on the nation’s economy,” he said. Jamoh said he was working hard to ensure the full implementation of his three-point agenda of boosting maritime security, safety and shipping development. He said the new Deep Blue Project (DBP), which would be launched in the coming weeks, would rid the nation’s maritime environment of illegalities. “The DBP is the nation’s Integrated Surveillance and Security Architecture that will sanitise our maritime industry. “NIMASA is investing in air assets through the acquisition of three special mission helicopters; two special mission aircraft and four unmanned air vehicles. “On maritime assets, the agency is also investing in two massive well-equipped special mission vessels that will patrol the high seas. “The vessels have capacity to deploy about 17 fast-moving interceptor boats – which are designed for interdiction purposes should there be any crises requiring a swift response.”
