 A 30-year-old ritual killer suspect, Tajudeen Monsuru, has said he used proceeds from human parts to drink beer and hang out with friends. Monsuru and three other suspects, Garuba Lukman (31years), Hamsat Akeem (25years) and Yusuf Awayewasere (37yearrs) were on Tuesday paraded in connection with murder and conspiracy at the Osun State Police Command, Osogbo. The Nation reports that Monsuru was arrested for the alleged killing of his girlfriend for ritual in Iwo on December 8 last year. While being paraded, Monsuru said: “I killed people and sold their parts to those that needed them. I killed my girlfriend, Mutiat Alani and other people. I strangled people and dismembered their bodies for those who needed them. I used the proceeds to buy beer and hang out with friends.” Police Commissioner Wale Olokode said: “On November 11 last year, a case of a missing person was reported at two divisions and transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID). “Detectives swung into action immediately. Through intelligence-led investigation, detectives arrested four suspects, who confessed to have kidnapped and killed the victims, Akanbi Adeolu, Alani Mutiyat, Akinloye Ibrahim and many others. One of the suspects, Awayewasere Yusuf, confessed to have bought the human parts and sold to some suspects still at large.” He said the decomposing parts had been exhumed and recovered as exhibits, adding that efforts are on to arrest other suspects. A 23-year-old expectant housewife, Mariam Musa, has been paraded for allegedly poisoning her stepson. Mariam, the first wife, said: “I poisoned my stepson because my husband showed love to my mate, (the second wife), as she had a male child. My husband does not give me attention since I can’t give birth to a male child. I am four-month pregnant. Jealousy made me kill the three-year-old boy.”
