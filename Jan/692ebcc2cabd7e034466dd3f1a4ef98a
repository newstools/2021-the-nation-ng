 THERE is fear in Ekiti State over alleged plot by the House of Assembly to sack some of its workforce under the guise of staff audit. The list of affected workers, according to a source in the Assembly complex, had been compiled. The source, who did not disclose the exact number of workers to be sacked, said the House of Assembly Service Commission had decided to embark on the staff audit to legalise the alleged disengagement plan. The organised labour has condemned the alleged plan by the House of Assembly to sack some workers under the guise of staff audit. The labour, in a letter signed by the secretaries of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Taiwo Akinyemi; Trade Union Congress (TUC), Lawrence Kuloogun; and Joint Negotiating Council, Gbenga Olowoyo, said the unions would resist attempt to sack workers under the facade of staff audit. In a letter dated 11th January, 2021 and addressed to the Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Funminiyi Afuye, it warned that sacking any worker at this point would strain the smooth and robust relationship between the labour and the administration of Governor  Kayode Fayemi. The letter titled: ‘Staff Audit in Ekiti State House of Assembly Service Commission, Need for Caution’, expressed disgust over the alleged audit it described as not being in tandem with the spirit of trust between the labour and the government. The letter said: “It is very essential to inform you that the attention of the state leadership of the organised labour has been drawn to the activities of the House of Assembly Service Commission through a letter dated 9th January, 2021, by Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PSSAN), in respect of staff audit report, which is now before the House of Assembly Service Commission. “As a matter of necessity, the leadership of the organised labour fumes over any action under the guise of staff audit to disrupt industrial peace in the workplace among public servants in Ekiti State.
