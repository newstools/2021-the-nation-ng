 SUBSCRIBERS seeking to link their National Identification Numbers (NINs) with their telephone numbers got a shocker yesterday National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) yesterday. They were told to come back on March 22. The extension granted by the Federal Government for them to sychronise their lines will expire on February 9. Stakeholders in the telecommunication industry have asked the Federal Government to further extend the timeline of blocking people’s Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards. Desperate Nigerians, who besieged the Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos Office of the NIMC went back home disappointed after they were given a March 22 date for enrolment. At the NIMC Office entrance, prospective enrollees were requested to register their names which were subsequently transferred to a notebook. They were asked to come on March 22 for data capturing. Efforts to get the reaction of NIMC were futile as neither the two mobile phone lines of its spokesman, Kayode Adegoke went through. Text message sent to him failed to elicit reaction too. Some of the youths at the centre said they needed to get their NINs so they could write the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) to gain admission into higher institutions, while others said they needed it to renew their expired driver’s licence and international passports.
