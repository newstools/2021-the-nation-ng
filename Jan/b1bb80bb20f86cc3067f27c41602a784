 Music star, Mr Eazi and actress cum designer, Temi Otedola, have opened up on their romance four years after it began in London, United Kingdom. In a new podcast, ‘How Far with Mr Eazi and Temi,’ the pair revealed some of the intimate details of their relationship to fans and listeners. Temi, who made her acting debut in Kunle Afolayan’s Citation, said her elder sister, DJ Cuppy, had told her that she would continue to work with Mr Eazi should their love affair fail. “I can never forget the only thing she (Dj Cuppy) said,” Temi began. “Those first weeks we were dating, she had obviously introduced us and she was there and she was still cultivating a working relationship with you (Mr Eazi). And so, she calls me and said ‘so you guys are dating officially and I said, yes, I like him and she said, all I am going to say is that if things don’t work well with you both, I am going to maintain my work relationship with him (Mr Eazi)’ and she was straight up about it.” The actress and fashion designer also revealed how she had set up a dinner date in a fancy restaurant to introduce Mr Eazi as her lover to her billionaire dad, Femi Otedola. Mr Eazi took the baton as he narrated the experience of meeting Otedola. “I remember meeting your (Temi) dad, I think my hair was pink or purple and to be honest, I only had tracksuits and we were going somewhere to have dinner so I remember I got like pants and a shirt and I had this Gucci shoes and I probably never wore them after that day. I thought it was like a big deal and I think that was one of the few times I respected dress codes in restaurants and not just piss people off because I wanted it to be cool. I think I was there a little bit late and your (Temi) dad mentioned something like that saying I am the superstar.” Mr Eazi and Temi have been together for 48 months and they are being positioned as an emerging power couple on the Nigerian entertainment scene.
