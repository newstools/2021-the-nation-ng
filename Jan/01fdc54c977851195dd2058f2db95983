An Ikeja High Court on Wednesday acquitted a lawyer, Yetunde Sousa, accused of stealing N50.2Million from Dominos Stores and Ozone Cinemas. Delivering judgment, Justice Raliat Adebiyi held: “the state failed to establish a prima facie against the defendant as there was no nexus linking the defendant to the allegations”. Acquitting Sousa, Adebiyi held that Sousa only acted in her professional capacities in the lease of the property in question. NAN reports that the Lagos State Government charged Sousa with theft. The state alleged that Sousa committed the offence between May and December 2011 at the Dominos Stores, Alagomeji, Lagos. The offence, the state added, contravened the provisions of Section 390(9) of the Criminal Code Laws Cap C17, Vol. 2 of Lagos State 2003. The lead state prosecutor, Mrs Rotimi Odutola alleged that the N50.2Million which belonged to the supermarket and cinema was given to her by Mr Michael Murray-Bruce. The allegedly stolen funds was for the renewal of the lease of a property situated at No. 1 Habour Road, Apapa, Lagos which belonged to NFS Food and Cold Storage Ltd. During the course of trial, three witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution and three witnesses including the defendant also testified for the defence. (NAN)
