 SUPER Eagles forward Victor Osimhen has revealed that he did not host the controversial birthday party, adding that he knew nothing about the party, according to reports. The Napoli star had taken part in a surprise birthday party without wearing a protective mask and the Partenopei have fined the 22-year-old after he tested positive for coronavirus upon his return to Naples after the Christmas holiday. He later apologised to the club and the fans with Napoli stating the most expensive African footballer would be fined for his actions. “Before I went to Nigeria, I told my sister that I wouldn’t celebrate my birthday,” he reportedly said.“I was not in the right mood because of my injury. “On that particular day, I had been asleep for about six hours. When I woke up, my sister asked me to go downstairs. “If you check what I put on, I was wearing the training jersey. I wouldn’t wear that for my birthday party.  I wouldn’t dress so casual. “I could celebrate my birthday in other ways too, but I wasn’t in a good mood. I went downstairs and they were playing music, gospel. “I was down there for about 10 minutes before my older brother called me back upstairs. I didn’t throw a party.”
