Harry Kane and Son Heung-min equalled the Premier League record for most goal combinations in a season as they inspired the hosts’ victory. Kane, who opened the scoring from the penalty spot, teed up the South Korean’s 100th goal for the club as the pair combined for a 13th time this term, matching the tally set by Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton at Blackburn in 1994-95. They have been the story of the season for Spurs and are just four short of equalling the total record of 36 set by Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard while at Chelsea.  Their unison here was timely as their contribution ended a four-game winless run in the Premier League, with Toby Alderweireld adding a third shortly after the break, though Matt Doherty was sent off at the death for two yellow cards. It was the first time Spurs scored three goals in a league game since they drew 3-3 with West Ham in October as the shackles finally came off after a month of sitting on leads. Marcelo Bielsa’s men had their moments, and peppered the Spurs goal with 16 shots, but they lacked the quality to ever look like scoring and their two-game winning run is over.
