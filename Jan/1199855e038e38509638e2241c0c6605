Bayer Leverkusen take on Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga today , with the visitors able to move level on points with their forthcoming opponents in the table with a victory. That prospect will have been made all the more difficult by Leverkusen’s morale boosting 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, though. Indeed, after four league games without a victory, Peter Bosz’s side looked like the team prior to the winter break once more on their way to a deserved win against their Champions League qualification rivals. Moussa Diaby in particular was in inspired form throughout the 90 minutes, firing Leverkusen into the lead with a decisive finish in the first half before setting up teenage sensation Florian Wirtz for the winner 10 minutes from time after a sensational counter-attack. Dortmund had rallied a little after the break, levelling proceedings via Julian Brandt’s fine curling finish, but even Edin Terzic and his players would have to admit that the better team on the day earned themselves a vital three points. Bosz must ensure that his players build on such an impressive performance and win, though, with another unbeaten run perhaps required if they are to sustain their place in the top four, and certainly to retain any lingering hopes of a challenging Bayern Munich for the title. Wolfsburg, meanwhile, got back to winning ways themselves on Tuesday with a commanding 2-0 win away to Mainz 05. After a dour first half, Bartosz Bialek and Wout Weghorst struck twice within 15 minutes of each other to take the game away from the struggling hosts, who failed to muster a single shot on target across the entire 90 minutes.
