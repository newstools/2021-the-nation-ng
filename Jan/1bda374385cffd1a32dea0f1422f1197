 THE Ebonyi State Government on Saturday directed schools across the state to resume for the continuation of the first term of the 2020 /2021 academic session on January 18. Education Commissioner, Onyebuchi Chima, said in Abakaliki that “resumption of academic activities in Ebonyi schools has been shifted to Monday, Jan. 18, as against the initial resumption date of Jan. 4.” “The postponement is due to the need to take precautions against the impending second wave of COVID-19 and in compliance to the directives of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 pandemic,’’ Chima said. Tertiary institutions in the state will resume academic activities tomorrow on condition of strict observance of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) COVID-19 protocols. The commissioner said Governor David Umahi explained that the decision to allow tertiary institutions to reopen was to ensure the return of students to full academic activities, especially as the Academic Staff Union of Universities had suspended its nine months industrial action. The government had directed schools to vacate for the Christmas holiday on Dec. 18, 2020, after it reopened schools in October, with the lifting of lockdown due to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
