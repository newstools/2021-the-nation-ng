 ABOUT 40 workers of the Louis Carter Industries Limited, Nnewi, Anambra State, have become jobless following the fire that razed a section of the company last weekend. Property worth about N500 million was reportedly gutted by fire. The firm deals in motorcycle spare parts. General Manager Ndubisi Okoli, during an on-the-spot assessment of the situation, said the affected workers had been hanging around the factory. He lamented that the incident had thrown the company into confusion. He said: “We’ve sent a Save-Our-Soul message to the Federal and state governments to enable us reinstate over 40 workers rendered jobless because of the fire that razed a section of the company. “Since the incident, some of the workers come in the morning and hang around to see what the company has to tell them. It is pathetic indeed and we cannot easily redeploy them to other sections where there are already workers. “They are eager to work but their section has been burnt by fire. Most of them are married youths with young families. Do we allow them return to the society and cause havoc?” According to Okoli, the multi-product manufacturer of versatile plastic products and auto components had been contributing meaningfully to the state economy and the nation generally. “The saving grace will be immediate  intervention from the governments to re-acquire some equipment and rebuild the burnt section to enable the company continue in its contribution to economic development and job creation,” he added.
