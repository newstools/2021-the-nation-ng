Jurgen Klopp is making personal pleas to Kylian Mbappe and his team in order to persuade the PSG forward to join Liverpool, according to Canal+. Mbappe, whose deal in Paris expires in 2022, has long been linked with the Premier League champions. The French broadcaster say the Reds manager is now personally involved in getting the deal done, with Mbappe said to be tempted by the prospect of being the undisputed star of the show at Anfield. Meanwhile Manchester United winger Facundo Pellistri is set to join Deportivo Alaves for the remainder of the season on loan, Goal can confirm. The 19-year-old winger signed for United on the final day of the summer transfer window but, with competition high in the first team and a lack of minutes available, he will join the Liga side until the end of the season to aid his development. Also, Paris Saint-Germain are looking to agree a deal that will allow them to keep Dele Alli beyond the end of an initial loan deal, reports Eurosport. The Ligue 1 giants are confident that they can lure the England international midfielder away from Tottenham, with the potential there for a permanent agreement to be pushed through in the summer.
