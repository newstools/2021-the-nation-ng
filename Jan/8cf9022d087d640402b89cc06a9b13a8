Students of the Cross River State College of Health Technology (CHT) have begged Governor Ben Ayade to pay their lecturers to ward off an imminent strike. A letter by President of the Students Union Government (SUG) Chima Kedemiti reads: “We join the teaching and non-teaching staff of the college in requesting that you please restore the industrial harmony in our college by interfacing with the various unions on campus to find lasting solution to issues relating to strike. “These demands have become pertinent to protect our citadel of intellectual justice. We believe the governor would not allow us embark on protest during this time of COVID-19 before our prayers are granted.” Findings show that the government has refused to pay workers of the staff of college their November and December 2020 salary over the disputed salary structure, known as Consolidated Tertiary Educational Institutions Salary Structure (CONTEDISS). CONTEDISS, which was approved by the Federal Government for all tertiary institutions, was domesticated in the state in 2013. The College of Health Technology started benefiting from it in September 2018, until November 2019 when the government reversed the payment structure to the initial 70 per cent CONTISS-2 which became outdated on July 1, 2009. Special Adviser to the Governor on Labour Matters Comrade Effiong Umoh said his office was intervening in the case. The 45 magistrates whose salaries have not been paid for 24 months have continued their protest at the Governor’s Office. The protest is in its third day. One of them however collapsed on the second day but he was resuscitated.
