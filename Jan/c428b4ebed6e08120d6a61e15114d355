Rangers took a seismic leap towards the Scottish Premiership title as 10-man Celtic’s defence crumbled further in a dramatic Old Firm derby at Ibrox. A Nir Bitton red card and a Callum McGregor own goal within eight second-half minutes inflicted a potentially decisive blow to Neil Lennon’s hopes of his side clinching an unprecedented 10 titles in a row. Celtic dominated the early proceedings, but now sit 19 points behind their peerless rivals going into the second half of the campaign. Steven Gerrard’s Premiership leaders – who have yet to lose a league game this season – have played three matches more, but are now in a formidable position as their campaign goes into the new year.  The prelude to this one was compelling. Rangers on their best start to a domestic campaign since 1928, while Celtic – on a resurgent turn of form – clinging on to their 10-in-a-row hopes by their fingertips. Yet on a day of great sporting consequence in Glasgow, there was more than a tinge of irrelevance to what was about to take place on the pitch. Driven by Callum McGregor – captain for the day with Scott Brown dropped to the bench after starting the past 30 Old Firm games – Celtic looked insatiable as they marauded forward at will. In their way stood an inspired Allan McGregor, who denied Odsonne Edouard early on and Leigh Griffiths soon after. Yet, it was his incredible one-handed save on to a post to deny the latter once more that made you think this was not going to be Celtic’s day.
