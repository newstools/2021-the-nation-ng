The Federal Government on Wednesday deployed 300 female soldiers to boost security on the Kaduna-Abuja highway. There have been several cases of kidnapping and killings in the area. Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai hosted the first batch of the troops, who are members of the Nigerian Army Women Corps (NAWC), at their Kakau base on the highway. The role of the women soldiers is to complement existing operations on the highway and its environs.  El-Rufai expressed optimism that with the deployment of the female soldiers, the insecurity on the highways would soon be over. The governor, who thanked the Army for deploying the troops, assured them of his administration’s support. “The problem of Abuja-Kaduna road will be over with these female soldiers because what a man can do a woman can do better. We believe in the capability of women in this state,” he said.
