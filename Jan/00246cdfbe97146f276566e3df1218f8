 Some  77 days after playing his last game in the Italian Serie A, Victor Osimhen played for 25minutes yesterday in Napoli’s 2-1 away loss to Verona. Osimhen was last in action for Napoli on November 8 in their 1-0 away win over Bologna before  he joined with Nigeria for the 2021 AFCON Qualifiers against Sierra Leone where he sustained a shoulder injury on November 13 in Super Eagles 4-4 draw at home  against the Leone Star of Sierra Leone  in Benin City. While still recuperating from the injury, Osimhen was tested positive to COVID-19 on January 1 while he was cleared of the virus on Friday January 22. Yesterday, he  came on in  the 65th  minute to replace Andrea Petagna but he could not save his team from going down to Verona in the tie. Osimhen  reportedly has a very light brace to stabilize his shoulder after dislocation. “Having suffered neurological damage, the Nigerian has a rubber instrument in his hand, a sort of sponge that he squeezes to improve the sensitivity of the limb,” noted Sky Sports. Despite the loss, Hirving Lozano’s goal against Hellas Verona after roughly nine seconds is the fastest in the history of Napoli. Federico Dimarco completely missed the ball allowing the Mexican winger to score after just 8.9 seconds in the first half. The former PSV’s goal is fastest one in the history of the Azzurri. The previous record belonged to Giovanni Venditto who scored the winner in a Napoli-Fiorentina in January 1942 after barely 20 seconds. Milan striker Rafael Leao had netted the quickest goal in the history of Serie A against Sassuolo earlier in December overtaking former Udinese star Paolo Poggi. Lozano is now behind the ex-striker with the third fastest goal ever scored in the history of the League.
