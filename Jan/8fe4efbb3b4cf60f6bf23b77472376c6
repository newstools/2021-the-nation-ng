A Magistrates’ Court in Ota, Ogun State, has ordered that two friends, who allegedly raped a 19-year-old girl, be remanded at a correctional centre. The police charged Oluwadamilare Oyeniyi, 30 and Okoriji Emmanuel, 30, with two counts of conspiracy and rape. Magistrate Mr. Shotunde Shotayo, who did not take the plea of Oyeniyi and Emmanuel, ordered the police to return the case file to the Ogun State Director of Public Prosecutions for legal advice. He adjourned the matter till March 5. The state counsel, Mr. Oluwole Ayede, had told the court that Oyeniyi and Emmanuel committed the offence on December 12 last year at their home in Ota. He alleged that Oyeniyi and Emmanuel conspired and raped the victim. Ayede also alleged that Oyeniyi and Emmanuel were caught making a video recording of their crime. The offence, he said, contravened sections 358 and 516 of Vol.1 Criminal Code Vol.1, Laws of Ogun State, 2006.
