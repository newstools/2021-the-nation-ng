Pablo Machin has been fired as the coach as Alaves, the Basque club confirmed on Tuesday, making him the fourth La Liga manager to lose his job this season. “Deportivo Alaves and Pablo Machin will go their separate ways,” a statement reads. “The club and the coach have brought an end to the contract that has linked the club since last August.” Alaves are without a win in three league games and back-to-back defeats against Atletico Madrid and Cadiz have left them 16th in the table, two points above the drop zone. Machin, 45, was appointed in Vitoria on Aug. 5 as the replacement for Juan Ramón López Muñiz. Since taking over, the former Girona and Espanyol coach has won four games, drawn six and lost eight in La Liga. However, Alaves have progressed through two rounds in the Copa del Rey. “The club wants to thank Pablo Machin and Jordi Balcells for their dedication since taking over and wish them the best for the future,” a statement added. Alaves also confirmed that Javier Cabello will take temporary charge of the first team as they look for a new coach. Machin becomes the fourth coach to be sacked in Spain’s top flight this season following the dismissals of Óscar García Junyent (RC Celta), Gaizka Garitano (Athletic Club) and Míchel (SD Huesca)
