 One of the high profile personalities that COVID-19 took away last year was Buruji Kashamu and it created a huge vacuum in Ogun State. Dolapo Balogun has been tipped by some observers to become the new Buruji of Ijebuland. “Buruji” literally means “wealth” in Yorubaland and Balogun possesses all the ‘Buruji’ qualities. At a wedding held recently at Queens Park in Victoria Island, Lagos, where some wealthy young men gathered, Balogun renewed his marital vows with his wife of 10 years. It was also an opportunity for the automobile dealer to display why he is fondly called the “Buruji” of our time by friends and associates. While doing what he knows how to do best, Fuji maestro, King Wasiu Ayinde Marshal endorsed Balogun. He sang: “Se e ti gbo, Buruji Tuntun ti wa ni Ijebu. Dolapo Balogun, Apawpaw, Owo wa, ipo wa, oni eyan.”  In English, it means: “We now have a new Buruji in Ijebu and he is wealthy too.” Dolapo has a lot in common with late Senator Kashamu. He is a PDP member and an Ijebu man. He is also a godson of late Buruji; he met him in 2014.
