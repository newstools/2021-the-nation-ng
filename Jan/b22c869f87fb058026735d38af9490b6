Controversial celebrity blogger Tunde Ednut had his Instagram account suspended for the second time on Wednesday. This suspension is coming three days after he attained one million followers on the platform. The Nation had reported on December 22, 2020, his account (@tundeednut), which had nearly 2.6 million followers, was suspended ‘indefinitely’ over claims that it violated the app’s terms and conditions. On January 10, he rejoined the platform with another handle (@kingtundeednut) and in less than three days raked in over 1 million followers due to the overwhelming support from some Nigerian celebrities and entertainers. Before his account got suspended, as at the early hours of Wednesday, when he gathered a million followers, he did a N1million ‘giveaway’. The Nation learnt that Ednut’s second suspension came on the back of claims he had put out a series of posts, which allegedly bordered on degrading and body-shaming women, cyberbullying fellow celebrities and engaging in spamming activities that went against Instagram’s policies. Instagram in its ‘account disable policy’ stated: “We disable accounts that have a certain percentage of violating content. We are now rolling out a new policy where, in addition to removing accounts with a certain percentage of violating content, we will also remove accounts with a certain number of violations within a window of time. “Similarly, to how policies are enforced on Facebook, this change will allow us to enforce our policies more consistently and hold people accountable for what they post on Instagram.”
