Two gun trucks belonging to the Boko Haram terrorists have been destroyed, as the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole bombarded the insurgents on the Wamdeo-Chul axis in southern part of Borno State. Terrorists were killed in the attack. Coordinator Defence Media Operations Maj.-Gen. John Enenche said in a statement: “The Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole has destroyed two Boko Haram Terrorists’ (BHTs’) gun trucks and eliminated some of their fighters on the Wamdeo-Chul axis in southern part of Borno State. “This was achieved as the Air Task Force scrambled Nigerian Air Force (NAF) helicopter gunships to provide close air support as troops repelled the terrorists, who attempted to breach the two locations.” The statement added: “Upon sighting the NAF helicopter gunships, the terrorists mounted on gun trucks and motorcycles, and attempted to beat a hasty retreat while firing at the attacked aircraft. “However, they were hit by the helicopters’ barrage of rocket and cannon fire, which resulted in the immobilisation of two of the gun trucks, one of which was seen engulfed in flames. “ “Several of the terrorists were also neutralised in the attack, while a few others were mopped-up as the helicopters continued to strafe the fleeing insurgents.”
