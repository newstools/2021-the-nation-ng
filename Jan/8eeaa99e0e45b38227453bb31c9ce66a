The Federal Government has asked schools to resume on January 18, 2021 after “due consultation” with stakeholders. The decision was reached after a meeting with stakeholders, including Governors, Commissioners of Education, Proprietors and heads of institutions, staff unions and students. The Director, Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Education, Ben Goong, in a statement on Thursday, said the consensus at the meeting was that the resumption date of 18th January should remain, while parents and respective institutions ensure full compliance with COVID-19 protocols. The meeting however insisted on the compulsory wearing of facemasks by all students, teachers and workers in all schools. Other measures arrived at during the meeting included compulsory temperature checks and hand washing facilities at strategic locations in all schools, ensuring constant supply of water and sanitizers and enforcement of maintenance of social distancing and suspension of large gatherings such as assembly and visiting days. The meeting called for avoidance of overcrowding, including limitations in class sizes and hostel occupancy; availability of functional health clinics with facilities for isolation and transportation of suspected cases to medical facilities; adherence to all other non-pharmaceutical protocols, restrictions and containment measures as may be prescribed/ approved by the PTF from time to time. “These measures which are to ensure safe reopening of schools for academic activities will be subject to constant review as we urge teachers, school administrators and other stakeholders to ensure strict compliance,” the statement added.
