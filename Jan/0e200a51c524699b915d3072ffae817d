 A CHIEF Magistrates’ Court in Osogbo, Osun State, on Tuesday ordered that a 32-year-old fake prophet, Olajide Omolere, who allegedly obtained N1.1 million from a woman to solve her “spiritual problems”, be remanded at  Ilesa Correctional Centre. The police charged Omolere with three counts of conspiracy, theft and fraud. Magistrate Mary Awodele ordered that the defendant be remanded due to the magnitude of the offence. Awodele, who refused to admit the defendant to bail, based on the oral bail application of the defence counsel, Mr. A. A. Adepoju, ordered him to file a formal bail application. She adjourned the matter till February 9. Police counsel ASP Idoko John had told the court that the defendant committed the offence between last November and December. He said the defendant conspired with orders at large and defrauded a businessman, Fatai Sadiku, of N 1,1 million. Idoko alleged that the defendant collected the money to perform a “spiritual cleansing” for Sadiku’s business to grow. The offence, he said, contravened sections 422, 419, 516 and 390 (9) of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol.11, Laws of Osun, 2002.
