Arsenal’s abysmal display against Crystal Palace this week showed the Gunners exactly what they’re missing by leaving Mesut Ozil on the side-lines. Though the north Londoners are functional as a unit, there’s very little spark this season, particularly from the attacking players. One can only speculate as to exactly why Mikel Arteta has continued to ignore any form of discourse with the player, but it appears that the impasse may soon be over. Turkish club, Fenerbahce, are known to be interested in acquiring Ozil’s services, and if he can come to an arrangement with the north Londoners which is also beneficial to Fenerbahce, the deal could finally get over the line. Certainly the Super Lig side’s sporting director, Emre, is very hopeful a deal can be concluded soon. “Mesut Ozil has been one of the most special players in the world for his position in the last 20 years,” he is quoted as saying to Turkish media, cited by Sky Sports. “If this transfer takes place, it will be a first. I regard it as a very positive move for both our community and our president, but I don’t think it will be easy. We have our own plans. And Mesut has a contract with his club.”
