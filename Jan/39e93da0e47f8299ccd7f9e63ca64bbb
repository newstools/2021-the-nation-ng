  Napoli Coach Gennaro Gattuso has  yet given up on the actual return date for injured  Victor Osimhen. Speaking after his side’s thrilling 6-0 hammering of Fiorentina 6-0  in a Serie A  match at the Maradona Stadium yesterday, Gattuso admitted he was unsure of the exact  return date for the Nigeria international. Acknowledging the contribution of players that  have since replaced Osimhen in Napoli’s  attack, Gattuso rued the absence of his Africa’s costliest player. “We are complete. Petagna has taken a blow to the calf and we hope it is nothing serious. Fernando is a player who will stay with us, we see the last days,” he explained. “But at the moment he does not move because we do not know when Victor Osimhen is back. “Mertens is not he’s still at his best and his ankle doesn’t give him peace. We’re not in great shape on the attackers at the moment, but we’ll find a solution. I think Petagna will succeed, we’ll see. Fernando will help us.” Meanwhile, ahead of this week’s Italian Super Cup against Juventus, Gattuso said: “Trophies are always important. We play against a mentally-minded team, their history tells us. “ For nine years they have won in Italy, they have made Champions League finals and we know they can have something more than us, but we will play it with great respect for Juve.”
