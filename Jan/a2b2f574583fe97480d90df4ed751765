 The Port Terminal Multiservices Limited (PTML) Command of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has declared N189.35 billion as revenie for 2020. The command also handled 151, 938 metric tonnes of export cargoes with Free on Board value of N117.34 billion in 2020. Customs Area Controller of the command,  Festus Okun, said the collected figure is N 30.01 billion higher than N159.34 billion that was collected in 2019, which represents 19 per cent increase. Okun said the command’s collection was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and ENDSARS protests which inhibited free movements of persons and cargoes. He added that about 80 percent of cargoes processed at the PTML port were vehicles while other cargo types accounted for twenty percent. “For us as a command, 2020 was a successful year considering our accomplishments in the discharge of our service core mandates of revenue generation, facilitation of legitimate trade, anti-smuggling activities and national security. “This was in spite of the challenges faced during the year due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and the worldwide economic meltdown” “During the year under review, the command made its first seizure in about six years. The seizure comprised six by 20ft. containers of Idole lightening soap and lotion with duty paid value of N287.01 million.’’
