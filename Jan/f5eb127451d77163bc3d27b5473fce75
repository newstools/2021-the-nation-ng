 Real Madrid bid to defend their trophy as they contest the Spanish Super Cup this week live on StarTimes’ World Football and Premium Sports channels. They will face Messi’s Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad in a competition that features a four-team line-up for the second time. Following the successful staging of the ‘new-look’ Supercopa de España last season, this year’s competition again features four teams. Real Madrid and Barcelona – as first and second in the La Liga respectively – as well as the two finalists from last season’s Copa Del Rey, Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao, qualified for the mini-competition, which will be played this week over three stadiums in Andalusia. Today, Real Sociedad will face FC Barcelona at 9pm; while Real Madrid will battle Athletic Club tomorrow at 9pm. The winners will meet on Sunday at 9 pm to decide the new Spanish Super Cup Champion. Real Madrid are the defending champions, having won the competition in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia last year – the first time the tournament was held with four clubs. Other exciting football competitions to look out for on StarTimes this week include the German Bundesliga, Coppa Italia, Copa Del Rey from Saturday and CAF CHAN 2020 also starting on Saturday.
