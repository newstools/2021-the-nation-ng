Conspiracy theorists are at work again. This time, they are intensifying efforts to stop us from taking the Coronavirus vaccines. According to them, some forces want to reduce the worldâ€™s population, especially Africans. One of their usual victims is billionaire Bill Gates, who they have mentioned again. But, let us get some facts straight: Statistics from the World Health Organisation (WHO) showed that there were 80 million cases of COVID-19, including no less than 2 million deaths globally. In Nigeria, more people have either contracted or died of the virus in the last few weeks. In Ogun State alone, no less than 33 people have died of the virus. The state has had some 3,000 confirmed cases. In Lagos, the confirmed cases have surged to close to 30,000. It has killed over 231 people. For the country, there has been a significant increase of up to 47 percent in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. With the vaccines, this year should be our year of hope. As a Third World nation, we contributed nothing to the development of vaccines. Only our sons in the Diaspora did, and that cannot count as our contribution, so we will not have equal access to the vaccines. When we access the vaccines, we should take advantage of it and not allow frauds on the pulpits and some other clowns masquerading as authorities to deceive us into running away from vaccination.
