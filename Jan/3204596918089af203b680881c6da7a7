 Ekiti State Police Command has said a Joint Security Team comprising police, Army and Nigerian Civil Defence Corps on Thursday foiled an attempt to kidnap three schoolchildren in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. The Police spokesman, Sunday Abutu, in a statement in Ado-Ekiti on Friday, said the alleged kidnapper identified as Mrs. Tawa Kazeem, attempted to abduct three schoolchildren along Bank Road, Ado-Ekiti. Abutu said the Joint patrol set up by the government acted swiftly following a tip off by some residents, foiled the kidnap operation and rescued the pupils. “On Thursday, about 2.20pm, some residents around INEC Office, Bank Road, Ado-Ekiti raised an alarm that a strange woman, one Mrs Tawa Kazeem, attempted to abduct three school children along Bank Road, Ado-Ekiti. “Upon the receipt of the information from a good Samaritan, a team of joint patrol, comprising the police, army and other security agencies put in place by the Ekiti State Governor was dispatched to the scene immediately. The team was able to rescue the children and apprehend the suspect. “The children narrated that the woman pleaded with them to help her carry her bag containing some items to an unknown destination. “The children said that they refused initially, but after a few moments of conversing with the woman, they became unconscious and started following the woman with her bag. “It took the quick intervention of some mechanics around who noticed their suspicious movement to stop them. “When asked about the children, she claimed that the children belonged to her. But the scenario changed immediately when the children countered her that she was not their mother. “During interrogation by the personnel of the Anti-Kidnapping unit, the woman could not satisfactorily state her mission and reason for trying to lead the school children to an unknown destination,” he said. Abutu said the suspect would be charged to court at the conclusion of the investigation.
