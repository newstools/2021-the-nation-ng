A CLERIC, Sam Olu Alo of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Grace of Mercy Prayer Mountain, Adamimogo Outreach, Lagos, has advised Nigerians to obey every protocol or guideline against the COVID-19 pandemic. Alo, who dismissed the insinuations from some quarters that government might been deceiving the nation about the spread of a second wave of the pandemic as amounting to pitiable  ignorance, warned the people to desist from such deception and diligently take precautionary steps as given by government against the pandemic. The cleric gave the advice while speaking with reporters during his church’s 2021 edition of a yearly programme, tagged: “Grace To Recover”. He warned Nigerians not allow the second wave of COVID-19 to devastate the nation’s economy further, stressing that reports from the western world about the resurgence of the pandemic were frightening. His words: “I will strongly advise that our people should take the issue of personal hygiene seriously. It is not yet time for us to think that we have won the battle against COVID-19. Let us continue to observe all regulations on social distancing. Let everyone use his or her facemasks and wash our hands regularly. “I have observed that a lot of people have abandoned safety precautions. This is not good enough; people should not see observing safety protocols as punishment from government, but for the good of our collective well-being. “Our economy is already in recession. So, going into another lockdown might be unbearable for the citizens.”
