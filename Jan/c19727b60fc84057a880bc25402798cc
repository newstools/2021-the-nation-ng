The youth wing of the apex Igbo sociocultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, worldwide, says there’s no crisis in the body in any way. The group told reporters Friday in Awka, Anambra State that the election that brought Prof George Obiozor as the president General was peaceful, free and fair in all ramifications. In a statement by the youth group, led by Ambassador Arthur Obiora, which was made available to reporters, said those drumming the embers of discord should go and find another thing to do. According to Ohanaeze youth group, “the attention of the leadership of Ohaneze Ndigbo Youth Wing Worldwide has been drawn to a statement made by the suspended National Publicity secretary of the organization, Chief Osmond Nkeoma discrediting the election that produced Prof George Obiozo led executive. “And we wish to dissociate the Youth Wing from such a callous and unfortunate statement. “We were part and parcel of the entire process of the election and make bold to state that it was peaceful, free and fair. “We wish to use this medium to once again congratulate Prof George Obiozor on his well deserved victory as the president of Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide and call on all Ndigbo to rally round him and support his administration to enable us benefit from his vast knowledge and experience. ” We pray that God will grant him wisdom like Solomon as he takes Ndigbo to the promised land,” Obiora wrote
