There is fire on the mountain following the sudden demise of popular billionaire, Bolu Akin-Olugbade, former military administrator of Imo and Lagos States, Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu (rtd); Lagos State Deputy Governor’s brother, Dr. Haroun Hamzat and Planet One Hotel owner, Shaka Momoh. Their passing has sent a shock wave to their well-heeled friends. What makes this more dreadful is that all these deaths were reportedly caused by COVID-19 complications. Although last year, the virus took the lives of socialites like Senator Buruji Kashamu and former Governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, things returned to normal and everyone thought the pandemic was under control. But then, suddenly, the second wave sweeps in and high society is bearing the brunt. Mayegun Wasiu Ayinde Marshal was even quick to warn guests at a recent Lagos party of the danger of COVID-19 and the need to take social distancing seriously. Although it was in his usual Yoruba dialect, he sang: “Don’t put the king of Fuji in trouble. I am here to talk about Coro. It is not a child’s at all. Please give me social distance. It is not child’s play.” Due to the fear of coronavirus, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, had to postpone his 50th coronation anniversary indefinitely. This is a landmark celebration for the royal father and all plans had been concluded to push the boat out for him. Yearly, Chief Rasak Okoya hosts high society to a lavish party for his birthday anniversary. But days ago as he turned 81, the celebration was limited to family members due to the pandemic. A source who refused to give names due to the sensitivity of the matter told Social Circuit that some other top society figures were in different isolation centres, while more are now concerned about their health. The source added that it would take God’s grace for some to survive the pandemic.
