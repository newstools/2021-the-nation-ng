Ford, after losing an appeal to United States’ federal safety regulators last week, now must spend US$610 million to replace faulty Takata airbags in three million cars and trucks in the U.S. and Canada. The recalled vehicles are from model years 2006 through 2012 and include some of Ford’s best sellers of that era, such as the Fusion sedan, Edge sport-utility vehicle, and Ranger pickup. The automaker attempted to avoid the airbag recall, asserting the particular Takata inflators in its models weren’t as lethal as those that have been linked to more than a dozen deaths in the U.S. because they could propel shrapnel at drivers and passengers. In its filing Thursday, Ford said its own study of its airbags found “the risks identified were so remote that they were inconsequential to safety.” The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rejected Ford’s petition on January 19. “We believe our extensive data demonstrated that a safety recall was not warranted for these driver-side airbags. However, we respect NHTSA’s decision and will issue a recall.,” Ford said in a statement. ”
