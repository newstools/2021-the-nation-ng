 Porsche has replaced the 2020 Panamera’s Turbo model with a more powerful Turbo S for the 2021 model year and added a new 4S E-Hybrid model as well. The rest of the Panamera lineup’s prices are unchanged, starting at $88,550 for the base model. Even the Panamera GTS ($130,650), which produces 20 more horsepower from its turbocharged V-8, sees no price increase. However, the base Panamera is still more expensive than other luxury sedans such as the Audi A7, BMW 8-series Gran Coupe, and Mercedes-Benz CLS-class. The 2021 Porsche Panamera prices exclude the addition of the new Turbo S and 4S E-Hybrid models. The 620-hp Turbo S, which replaces the 2020 Panamera Turbo, starts at $179,050, and the new 4S E-Hybrid starts at $114,650. The 4S can now be had as a plug-in E-Hybrid, which, along with the rest of the E-Hybrid lineup (Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and Turbo S E-Hybrid), gets a larger 17.9-kWh battery pack, up 3.8 kWh from the previous models. The new 4S E-Hybrid starts at $114,650 and is powered by a twin-turbo V-6 in conjunction with an electric motor and the new battery pack and makes 552 horsepower. It’s also available as longer-wheelbase Executive ($125,950) and Sport Turismo wagon ($118,650) models, like other Panameras excluding the base model and the GTS, which only has standard and Sport Turismo offerings. For the 2021 model year, Porsche dropped the 550-hp Panamera Turbo model in favour of a new, more powerful Turbo S. It starts at $179,050—$24,700 more than the 2020 Panamera Turbo—and is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that produces 620 horsepower and 604 pound-feet of torque. Porsche claims that it’ll reach 60 mph in 2.9 seconds. The new Turbo S is also available as Executive ($189,450) and Sport Turismo ($183,050) models. Porsche has also given the 2021 Panamera a few small visual changes as well including a slightly sportier front end, a full-width LED strip on the taillights, and some new wheels. In addition, wireless Apple CarPlay capability and wireless phone charging are standard on all 2021 Panameras.
