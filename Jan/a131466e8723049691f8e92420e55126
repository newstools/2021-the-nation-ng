  Arsenal continued their Premier League resurgence with a ruthless victory over strugglers West Brom at The Hawthorns. Defender Kieran Tierney’s excellent solo run and curling finish put the Gunners in front in the first half, before the impressive Bukayo Saka rounded off a stunning passing move to make it 2-0. Alexandre Lacazette added the third and fourth goals after the break – smashing in a rebound from Emile Smith Rowe’s shot before he was set up by Tierney. It was Arsenal’s third league victory in a row after they had failed to win their previous seven. West Brom, playing their fourth match under new manager Sam Allardyce, remain second from bottom and six points from safety.  (BBCSports)
