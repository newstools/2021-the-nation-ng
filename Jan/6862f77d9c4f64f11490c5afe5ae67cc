 The management of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto(UDUS) has  reached  an agreement with the landlords of the private apartments on the campus for students to pay 50 per cent of their  rent. Students across the country have been at home for the past 10 months, partly because of the COVID-19 outbreak and the industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). However, the management and Student Union President, Faruku Barade Wamakko, at a meeting last week agreed that students should pay half of the new rent, which is 50 per cent. Barade said he had appealed to landlords not to collect rent for the new session, but they didn’t agree. “The meeting between the  management, students and landlords  of private hostels has come to an end. We  tried all our best and we came to the conclusion that students are to pay 50 per cent of what they used to  pay. “For example, if you have been paying N50,000 house rent before, be ready to pay N25,000 this time round, for the whole session,” he said. He urged  students to abide by the COVID-19 regulations as they were returning to campus to contain the spread of the virus. ” I  urge all students to abide by the COVID-19 safety protocols as they  return to campus and make sure they don’t breach any of them,’’ he said.
