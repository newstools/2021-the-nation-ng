 THE Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPCTRE) has vowed to shutdown the headquarters of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) from January 21, 2021 following the expiration of a 21-day ultimatum issued to the management of the commission. AUPCTRE, which is an affiliate of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), in a strike notice dated December 18, 2020 and addressed to the Registrar-General of CAC frowned at the chief executive for his alleged anti-workers policies in the commission. The union, in the notice signed by its General Secretary Comrade Musa Ekpo, listed some of the grievances of the workers to include lack of career progression, poor welfare and injustice against the staff. Others include denial of earned 2019 promotion arrears, stoppage of all staff loans, among others. Chairman of AUPTCTRE, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Chapter, Comrade Aliyu Maradu, said the union had written letters to both the Board Chairman and Registrar-General to address the situation, but no attention was paid to address the pains of the workers. He said: “Arising from the above and in discharging our responsibility based on responsive and responsible Trade Union, guided by the principles of collective bargaining, due process, public service rules and strict adherence to the union and constitution of Nigeria, the union is hereby giving the management of CAC a  21-day ultimatum starting from Monday 21 December 2020 to address all the issues raised above, in order to douse already tensed industrial relations atmosphere and possibly avert a looming industrial crisis in CAC.” The Branch Chairman of AUPTCTRE in CAC Comrade Ibrahim Makirfi said: “The issue we have with the Registrar-General of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) has to do with the promotion of staff of the commission. “When he came he asked for the support of the union to ensure the goal and mandate of the commission is achieved and the union gave him 100 percent support but as you know there is no motivational factor for workers like promotion, so before he came onboard the management as at then were planning promotion exams but he told us he wants to  suspends the process and reform the system. “We believed him and a committee was put in place including union members and several vacancies where discovered but the Registrar- General unilaterally limited the vacancies and even denied many staff written promotion exams.”
