 The national champion in the women’s Discus, Princess Kara, is looking forward to setting a new personal best as she gets set to make her debut for Central Arizona College in the USA. The 2018 National Festival gold medalist set a Personal Best (PB) of 50.89m at the Okowa COVID-19 Resumption Meet in Asaba last November. Kara, who secured a track scholarship and is studying General Studies, says her recent relocation is for the best even though she misses her family and friends. “They know the goals and the aspirations, so I just have to do what I have to do to get there,” the 20 year-old told makingofchampions.com. “Definitely it will take me time to adjust to a whole new kind of weather, time zone and environment. But surely with time I will get used to everything around me. “I feel great & energized about this opportunity because I know sooner or later I will start throwing good distances that will put me out there in the world. This will impact my career because I will be working with the best of everything. I’m looking forward to doing a PR”.
