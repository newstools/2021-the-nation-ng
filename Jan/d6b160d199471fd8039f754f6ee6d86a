A Federal High Court in Abuja heard on Wednesday how Halima, the wife of a former Minister for Special Duties, Kabiru Taminu Turaki, refunded N75 million to the Federal Government. A former investigator with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Hamma-Adama Bello, said the ex-minister’s wife made the refund when his team probed the alleged diversion of N359 million public funds during Turaki’s tenure. Turaki was the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs between 2013 and 2015 and served as the Supervising Minister for Ministry of Labour between 2014 and 2015 under ex-President Goodluck Jonathan. Bello said his team found how the money was distributed into various accounts linked to individuals closed to the ex-minister, including his wife. Bello testified as a prosecution witness in the trial of the former minister and others. Turaki is being tried on a 16-count money laundering charge with his former Special Assistant, Sampson Okpetu, as well as two firms – Samtee Essentials Limited and Pasco Investment Limited. Led in evidence by lawyer to the prosecution, Mohammed Abubakar, Bello said N45 million was transferred to the minister’s brother, Abdullahi Maigwandu, through his Zenith Bank account. He added that from the amount, Maigwandu transferred N20 million to Halima’s Guarantee Trust Bank account. Bello, who said another N20 million was transferred to O-Pec Nigeria Limited, added that Halima withdrew the remaining N5 million in China by using Maigwandu’s ATM card to buy furniture. According to him, another N30 million was transferred to Abubakar Sani Gude’s Zenith Bank account from the account of the Ministry of Special Duties to Turaki’s wife. The trial judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo adjourned till February 9 for the continuation of trial.
