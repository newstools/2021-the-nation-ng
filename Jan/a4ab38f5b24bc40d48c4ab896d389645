The younger sister of late popular Yoruba actress Mrs. Folake Aremu known as Orisabunmi, Mrs Janet Ademola, is dead. News of Janet’s death was broken and confirmed on Saturday by Gbenga Onisola, her nephew. Janet, who is the last child of the family, died three days after the death of Orisabunmi. Orisabunmi’s immediate elder brother, Steve Onisola, reportedly died on Thursday, barely 24hours after the death of the popular actress. Onisola, the Technical Director of Kwara Falcons Basketball Club, Ilorin, passed on at age 71 after a brief illness.
