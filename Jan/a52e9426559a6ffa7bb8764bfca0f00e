 Tammy Abraham emulated his manager for Chelsea in their 3-1 win over Luton yesterday, becoming the first Englishman since Frank Lampard to net an FA Cup hat-trick for the Blues. Abraham scored twice in the first half and once in the second as the Blues saw off some spirited opposition from the Championship. He was the first Chelsea player to score a hat-trick in the competition since Brazilian playmaker Oscar against MK Dons in 2016, and the first Englishman since Lampard against Macclesfield in January 2007. Promisingly for Chelsea, Lampard’s effort helped his side on their way to the 2007 FA Cup final, where they beat Manchester United 1-0 with an extra-time winner from Didier Drogba.  Lampard was also the last player to score twice in an FA Cup fixture for Chelsea, when both he and Daniel Sturridge did so against Ipswich in 2011. “It’s great to score a hat-trick and win the game so comfortably,” Abraham told BBC Sport. “It is always nice to get a win and play well. Hopefully we will take that confidence on.” Abraham’s goals took him to 11 goals in all competitions this season, making him Chelsea’s top scorer. After bagging 18 last season, he became the first Chelsea youth team product to score 10 or more goals in back-to-back seasons since Michael Fillery in 1982-83.
