Crystal Palace got back to winning ways against Wolves thanks to Eberechi Eze’s second-half strike. The summer signing struck for the third time since his move from QPR to lift spirits at the club after a run of one win in 10 matches across all competitions. It was also Palace’s first triumph over Wolves in five attempts and increased the woes of Nuno Espirito Santo, who has not seen his players taste success in the Premier League for six weeks with this another toothless showing. In wet and windy conditions at Selhurst Park, the long wait for an effort on target ended in the 56th minute when new Wolves signing Willian Jose tested Vicente Guaita in the home goal with a fine strike on the turn following’s Daniel Podence’s cross. Like London buses, four minutes later it was Palace’s turn to hit the target and it saw them open the scoring. After wonderful quick passing on the left, Nathaniel Clyne’s burst forward on the opposite wing was spotted by Zaha and the defender managed to find Jordan Ayew in space. Palace’s no9 passed into Eze, who let the ball roll across him to fool Leander Dendoncker before he unleashed a venomous strike past Rui Patricio from 16 yards. Wolves introduced Adama Traore for the final 27 minutes but the game should have been put to bed soon after. A wonder break gave Palace a two-against-one situation and while Zaha brilliantly checked back onto his left foot, he thundered his effort against the crossbar and it stayed 1-0 to the hosts. Fabio Silva was summoned by the visitors in the 78th minute and fellow forward Jose thought he equalised with a powerful header but Guaita impressively got down low to save and help Palace rise to 13th.
