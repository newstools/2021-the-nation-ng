 Founder of Africa Movie Academy Award, Peace Anyiam-Osigwe, has expressed concern on the lack of structure and understanding of the Nigerian film industry over many decades. In an exclusive chat with The Nation, Anyiam-Osigwe said many practitioners are still underperforming when it comes to the business side of filmmaking. “Basically, we are lacking structures and understanding of the industry itself. A lot of people just think of the creative side of the industry, not the business side of it,” Anyiam-Osigwe said. The film producer who recently emerged as the seventh National President of the Association of Movie Producers’ (AMP) revealed that this void was one of the reasons she decided to take over the movie producers’ guild. “One of the reasons I came out to be the President of the Association of Movie Producers’ is because if the producers can get their house in order and get the banks to understand the financing of this industry, the better for us in a long way, short run.” Anyiam-Osigwe further urged aspiring filmmakers to get into an internship to learn from experts. “First and foremost, get into an internship. Don’t be too much in a hurry to join everything but just learn the process. Even if you get educated in the school run and then get educated on the practical side as well.” On the second wave of COVID-19, she believes the industry is still struggling as many actors and producers were not unable to work due to the government restrictions.
