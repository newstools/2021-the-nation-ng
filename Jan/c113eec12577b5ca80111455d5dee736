 THE Federal Housing Authority (FHA) has handed over a site for the construction of 900 low cost housing units in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, to approved builders. The authority handed over the site to the builders last week after scrutinising documents at a meeting on the site. The estate, Ajoda New Town, will sit on a 60-hectare located on Ibadan-Ife expressway. The Managing Director, FHA, Sen. Gbenga Ashafa, represented by the Southwest Zonal Manager, Mrs. Oluwatoyin Bada, said the project was expected to be completed within 24 months. She urged the development partners to abide by the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of the housing scheme.
