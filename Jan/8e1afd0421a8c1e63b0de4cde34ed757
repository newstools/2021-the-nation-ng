 The Vice Chancellor, Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, Prof  Edward Olanipekun,  has said the institution will be relentless in its drive for human development in the state and nation at large. He said this during the  virtual matriculation  of the institution’s Directorate of Part-Time Programmes for fresh students in various study centres for the 2019/2020 academic session. Olanipekun told the new students to work hard, stressing that the institution was not meant for lazy students. He said: “Since the university was established in 1982, it has continued to justify the dreams of its founding fathers by playing responsible roles in contributing to the human development needs of Nigeria and Ekiti State in particular.” He  further advised  the matriculants to shun cultism, examination malpractices and all other vices that could jeopardise their academic success in the university. He  assured them that they would enjoy the same rights and privileges with the regular students as long as they obey all rules and regulations. The  Registrar, Mr. Akin Arogundade, administered the matriculation oath on the 174 students who participated through the Zoom app in compliance with the COVID-19 protocols.
