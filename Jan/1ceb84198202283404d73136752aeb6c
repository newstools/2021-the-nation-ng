  Quadri Aruna will be aiming for revenge  as RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell host  TSV Bad Königshofen on Tuesday  in a  week 15 of the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL). Still unbeaten in the New Year, TTC Fulda  goes in today’s battle fresh  with the 3-0 defeat suffered away to the visitor on week one of the TTBL last September. Yet TTC would again be relying on Aruna’s form against the star-studded visiting side complete with  experienced German international Bastian Steger. TTC Fulda Coach Qing Yu Meng is in good spirits: “We know that we will see a good team at home. We can win the game.” The visiting team are seventh in the TTBL table, three places ahead of the TTC Fulda  but a confident Aruna told NationSport that they are ready to avenge the first leg loss. “I remember what happened in the match being my first game in the Bundesliga,” recalled Aruna. “ But  things have changed since then as I am getting used to the league now and I hope we can avenge the first leg defeat at home against Königshofen. “It promises to be exciting and we hope we can pull through in the match,” he said. The TTC Fulda is expected to field Aruna alongside Ruwen Filus and Fan Bo Meng as the team is still hopeful of getting their new Asian player Lam Sui Hang who could not travel to Germany following travel ban by the Hong Kong government.
