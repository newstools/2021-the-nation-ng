 EX-PRESIDENTS of the National Association of Kwara State Students (NAKSS) Prince Suleiman Fagbemi and Dr AbdulRahman Yusuf have urged  members of the association to use dialogue in demanding their rights and entitlements from government. They added that protests or demonstrations in asking for bursary and scholarship from government have become outdated. The duo said this in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital at a programme for the reunion of former members of the association. The theme of the event was : Leadership transformation: roles, impact and participation of NAKSS ex-members in Kwara politics and community development. Prince Fagbemi, who was the pioneer national president of NAKSS, said: “Dialogue remains the in thing now for asking for your rights. I therefore, urge the current executives to put it in the minds of members that protests and table banging have become old fashioned. “We are all responsible men and women from respectable homes that should shun thuggery and antisocial behaviours.” Yusuf, who was the guest lecturer, said student unionism had gone beyond fighting the governemnt. He noted that it was about offering useful pieces of advice to government. He also said age was not a barrier in leadership, stressing that tested and trusted people should be in power. He said: “NAKSS should see itself as a game changer for the state. It should always be interfacing with every governemnt in power for the advancement of the state. “Quality education is the antidote to almost all the problems of the state. Ex-NAKSS leaders should establish a foundation that will be addressing this in the state. “Repositioning NAKSS as formidable pressure group and becoming a think-tank for the state is  a necessity.”
