 THE Federal Government on Monday promised to support the reconstruction of Sokoto market with 16,000 main and makeshift shops. The market was destroyed by fire last week. The Federal Government made the pledge through a five-man delegation it sent to the state to sympathise with the government and the residents over the loss. The Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, led the delegation. Other members of the delegation were former governor and  Chairman of the Senate Committee on Defence, Aliyu Wamakko; Ministers Muhammadu Maigari Dingyadi (Police Affairs); Isa Ali Pantami (Communications and Digital Economy), and Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq (Disaster Management and Humanitarian Services). Governor Aminu Tambuwal received the delegation in Sokoto. Gambari said President Muhammadu Buhari expressed concern and showed solidarity with the state government and its people over the damage the fire caused. He described the Sokoto market as an industrial hub to the state and national economies. Gambari said: “President Buhari was touched by the incident and expressed a high level of concern to the people of the state. This is why we are here to convey his message.” Tambuwal, who said the fire razed 60 per cent of the shops, expressed the gratitude of the residents, especially the victims, to the President for the Federal Government’s gesture.
