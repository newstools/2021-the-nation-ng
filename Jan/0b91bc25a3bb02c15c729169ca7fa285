 LAGOS State Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu has ordered Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) to enforce COVID-19 protocols as highlighted by the Presidential Taskforce and Lagos State Government. Odumosu gave this order in a statement issued on Thursday by the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi. The commissioner said officers must enforce the use of face masks regularly at public places like markets and malls as well as ensure that social distancing was adhered to. “Also, the total closure of night clubs, bars, lounges, event centres, social party and street carnivals must be discouraged. “The use of infra-red thermometers to check body temperature, sanitisers and enforcement of the imposed curfew between 12 midnight and 4:00 a.m must be strictly adhered to,” he said. Odumosu ordered Area Commanders and DPOs to also ensure the enforcement of the protocols in their various commands and stations across the state. “COVID-19 is real and we must do everything possible within our reach to halt its spread,” he said. The commissioner warned Area Commanders and DPOs to adequately supervise their men for effective service delivery and kick against incivility, misconduct and indiscipline among the officers. “Drunkenness, excessive or misuse of power, accidental discharge, extortion and other inappropriate behaviours as such, will not be tolerated in any way. “Anyone found wanting will be heavily sanctioned within the ambit of the law,” he said. Odumosu urged the public to be law-abiding, support security agencies for effective policing of the state and stay safe at all times, wishing everyone a Happy New Year ahead.
