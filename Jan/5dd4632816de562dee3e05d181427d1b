 THE police command in Zamfara has arrested four suspects over alleged killing of a Fulani herdsman. At a press conference in Gusau on Sunday, Commissioner of Police Abutu Yaro said the command also recovered 200 rustled cows. He said further that some weapons were equally recovered while the command secured the release of eight persons abducted three weeks ago. “We recovered no fewer than 200 stolen cows, five AK 47 rifles, three vehicles and a large number of ammunition,” he said. “As a result of the ongoing peace engagement in Shinkafi Local Government Area, we have recovered one AK-47 rifle with two magazines and 18 rounds of live ammunition,” he said.
