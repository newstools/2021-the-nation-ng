Harley and Rainbow Specialised Laboratories has been approved as COVID-19 testing centre by the Lagos State Government and NCDC. It offers specialised laboratory tests, including COVID-19 PCR tests to the public, especially people travelling into and out of Nigeria. To cover the stretch of Lagos State, the laboratory is currently in three locations. The firm, which is equipped with fully automated Biosafety Laboratory system for PCR testing with the capability to deliver results within 24 hours, is able to screen with options of walk-in or home sample collection service. According to the firm’s Administrative Manager, Omolabake Amuni, the laboratory has made it one of its mandate to ensure the state and the country attain a COVID-19-free status through its contribution to offering quick and reliable results. “Test results are returned to patients through the company’s online portal and electronic delivery system. The operation is in strict adherence to approved regulations by the NCDC as the results are acceptable nationally and internationally, being one of the few accredited private laboratories in Lagos State for COVID-19 PCR testing,” Amuni said.
