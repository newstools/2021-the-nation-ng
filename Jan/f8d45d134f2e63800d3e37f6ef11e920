 For some time now, interior designer Ehizogie Ogbebor has been in the news. There are even speculations that the beautiful woman may tie the knot with her  lover, Lagos State chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Musiliu Akinsanya,  aka MC Oluomo. Although her two marriages failed, the mother of three has hinted that she has not given up on marriage. According to her, she is in love again and is open to marriage. Not too long ago Ogbebor went public with her relationship with Oluomo amid their romance rumours.  On her Instastory, she put out emoji-laden photos of her spending time with him. Although Oluomo’s face was covered, she is seen giving the NURTW chairman a kiss on the cheek. Also included in Ogbebor’s photo of him was an inscription that read “king” and a love emoji below. The lady also shared footage of her spraying naira notes on Oluomo as he danced at the fifth coronation anniversary of the Oluwo of Iwo held a few weeks ago.
