Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and Thomas Tuchel would have a tempestuous relationship should the German take up the reins at Stamford Bridge, according to our latest vodcast with The Beautiful Game, with Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl floated as a superior option should they replace Frank Lampard. The German was fired by Paris Saint-Germain over the Ligue 1 winter break and replaced by Mauricio Pochettino, while Lampard is coming under increasing pressure, with just two Premier League wins in the last eight matches. Tuchel boasts trophy-winning pedigree, having won the French championship twice, a Coupe de France and a Coupe de la Ligue during his time in Paris, along with a DFB-Pokal from his two-year stint at Borussia Dortmund. But would he be the best option to rejuvenate Chelsea, or would another German, working in England already, be a better option? “I think it’s a tough one because when you look at it, is Tuchel the man to take that final step?” asked Dot from The Beautiful Game podcast. “We saw him get to the Champions League final and ultimately fail at the final hurdle. Chelsea are a team that pride themselves on success: they need to win a trophy every year. Is Tuchel that man to compete with Klopp and Pep Guardiola at the top level? I’m not quite convinced.”
