Three persons were burnt to death while six others sustained critical injuries on Tuesday morning in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, as a petrol tanker fell and exploded into flames. The accident took place on the busy Presidential Boulevard. The tanker driver lost control of the vehicle while descending the Kuto Bridge following a brake failure. On its way down the bridge, the tanker knocked down a commercial motorcyclist, killing him instantly, while others were severely injured as they struggled to get away from the raging blaze. It was learnt  that the tanker also collided with a Lexus SUV. Operatives of the Ogun State Fire Service made frantic efforts to battle the inferno. Spokesman of the state Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Babatunde Akinbiyi, who confirmed  the accident, said three persons, including the truck driver,  were  burnt to death while six others were critically injured. Akinbiyi attributed the accident to brake failure, forcing the tanker to veer into the lane of oncoming vehicles and back to its lane before it fell and burst into flames. Seven vehicles and six motorcycles were burnt in the incident, he said. Governor Dapo Abiodun has banned tankers and other articulated vehicles from plying overhead bridges in the state, just as those who flout the order would be made to pay stiff penalties. Abiodun who gave the order after inspecting the accident scene at Kuto, Abeokuta, said henceforth, tanker drivers would no longer be allow to use the bridges. The governor  recalled  a similar accident at Ota in 2019 where lives were lost and property destroyed,  saying the state would enforce road worthiness to ensure. “Tanker drivers will no longer be allowed to use the bridges. Anything that has trailer behind it, be it trailers, flatbeds and other articulated vehicles of either 33 or 66 tons, are henceforth banned from using the bridges,” he said.
