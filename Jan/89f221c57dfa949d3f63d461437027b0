Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the appointment of new Service Chiefs. Wike, in a statement by his Commissioner for Information and Communications, Pastor Paulinus Nsirim, noted though the appointments came late, the President should be commended for listening to the voices of the people. He challenged the new appointees to see their appointments as an opportunity to re-engineer the nation’s security architecture, which had suffered a tremendous setback in the last five years. “The new Service Chiefs should not politicise security by aligning with politicians. What the country needs now is competence and professionalism that will reduce insecurity to the barest minimum,” he said. Wike noted that Nigerians, who lost confidence in the former Service Chiefs were looking up to the new appointees to make the desired change. He called on all levels of government to give the Service Chiefs the needed support they would require to execute their assignments. “This is an opportunity to serve the nation and I believe that the Service Chiefs will be focused and dedicated,” he said.
