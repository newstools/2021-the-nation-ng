Four policemen were killed and one missing following an ambush by hundreds of bandits on a convoy of officers attached to Police Mobile Force – 9 PMF Squadron, Kano on Friday along the Birnin Gwari – Funtua Highway. Force Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba, who disclosed this in a statement on Sunday, said the policemen were on their way back to their base in Kano after completion of their special duty. Mba said the policemen repelled the attack and inflicted heavy casualties on the bandits after exchange of gunfire. He said contrary to reports in some sections of the media that 18 officers were kidnapped, only 16 officers were attacked in the ambush. He said the officers were personnel attached to Operation Puff Adder and deployed to Niger in the sustained operation to reclaim the public space and tackle incidents of banditry, kidnapping and other violent crimes in the area. The police spokesman said the Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu, commended the officers for displaying uncommon gallantry and repelling the attack.
