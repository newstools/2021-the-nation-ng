The Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) has condemned the increase in electricity tariff. It described it as brutish, inhuman, and an attempt to fuel national crisis. The congress also restated its commitment to true federalism on the basis of regionalism, saying Nigeria cannot make any meaningful progress with the 1999 Constitution ‘which is a democratic albatross’. A statement by the National General Secretary Babajide Tanimoowo, and Publicity Secretary Yinka Oguntimehin, said the call for true federalism is imperative given the present situation in the country. The statement reads: “OPC is concerned about the state of the nation. We are worried about the current political structure. We are also worried about the present state of the economy. We are particularly worried about the security situation. “How do we explain that in the first week of the New Year, the government came up with a sudden increase in electricity tariff? It is sad and brutish. Government can no longer save the situation from degenerating further. “We urge the government to overhaul the security architecture in the country to guarantee security. All the service chiefs have overstayed their tenure. It is evident they have nothing new to offer us considering the nature of the various security challenges confronting the country.” OPC also advised governors of the Southwest states to rededicate themselves to the struggle against insecurity.
