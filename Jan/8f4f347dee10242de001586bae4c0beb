The Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) has urged Nigerians to strive towards fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Chairman of CLO, Anambra State Mr. Vincent Ezekwueme, gave the counsel while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Sunday on areas Nigerians needed to focus on in 2021. Ezekwueme called on Nigerians to use the New Year to collectively resolve more than ever before to stop the escalation of COVID-19. “COVID-19 pandemic remains the greatest threat to humanity, our health and socio-economic wellbeing as individuals and a nation. “However, we can battle it through strict observation of prevention protocols and maintaining optimal hygiene,’’ he said. The CLO boss also called on leaders across the country to work towards tackling challenges facing the country in 2021. “It is existential reality that with a gun you can kill a terrorist; but with education and skill acquisition you can kill terrorism holistically. “I wish to reiterate my earlier appeal for government to formulate education policies that will include head, heart and hand to eliminate poverty of mind and hand, thereby reducing unemployment, restiveness, idleness and crime,’’ he said. Ezekwueme called on Nigerians to make the necessary sacrifices towards getting the country out of recession in 2021. “We must make necessary sacrifices for the common good and interest through patriotic desire for social well-being of others above our selfish interest. “It is pertinent to note that if we can do things right, be content with the blessings of God upon us, think about common good and be selfless; 2021 will usher in much cherished peace, unity, progress and prosperity,” he said.
