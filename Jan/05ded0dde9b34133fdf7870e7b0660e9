 Nollywood actor, Seun Kentebe recently caused a stir on social media after revealing that his mother is yet to accept his wife after seven years of marriage. “7 years in and my Mom still doesn’t like my wife. I’ve accepted my fate. We move,” he tweeted. The tweet, however, generated a lot of reactions as fans took sides. While many lambasted the actor’s mother, few fed him with advice. The ‘93 Days’ actor, who could not withstand the heat, followed up with another tweet, claiming his post was not in any way meant to demonise his mum. “She’s a sweet soul. I’ve realized it’s a firstborn son problem. Some mothers have a hard time letting go of their first sons and that’s the hand I’ve been dealt,” he tweeted further. Continuing, the Bayelsa State-born actor wrote, “Till she comes around, I’ll keep managing the situation. That means acting like a man with two wives; they kuku say our mothers are the first wives.” He further submitted that it will be fine if the odds eventually fall in his favour and if it doesn’t his ship will stay afloat as his relationships with his wife and mother will not wane.
