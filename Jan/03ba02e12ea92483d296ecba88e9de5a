Troops using fighter jets have bombarded bandits in Birnin-Gwari, Giwa, Igabi and Chikun councils of Kaduna State. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan disclosed this in a statement on Thursday evening, saying that the areas covered in the four councils included Kaduna-Birnin Gwari Road, Buruku, Ungwar Yako, Udawa, Polewire, Crossing Point, Gagafada, Kugu, Kampani Doka, Gwaska, Goron Dutse and adjoining settlements. Aruwan said Governor Nasir El-Rufai commended  the troops on the success of the mission. “Bandits were spotted with cattle about 9km north of Gidan Audu, and were duly neutralised. It was the same situation southwest of the same location,” he said. “At the foot of a high ground west of the village, more bandits with cattle were sighted and engaged. Furthermore, armed bandits were sighted at Gagafada attempting to cross from Polewire to Kampanin Doka, and were neutralised by the fighter jet crew. However, four persons were killed in Igabi and Chikun councils by bandits, who attacked the villages in their dozens. Aruwan confirmed this in a statement on Thursday evening, adding that patrols are set to be sustained in the trouble locations.
