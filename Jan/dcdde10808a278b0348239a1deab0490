About eight fire outbreaks have been recorded in Anambra State less than 24-hours after the harmattan started, State Fire Chief Martin Agbili has said. Agbili, in a statement on Sunday, attributed majority of the incidents to carelessness, including indiscriminate bush burning. He listed the affected areas to include Awka, Nnewi, Onitsha, Awka, Ogidi, Nise and Enugwu-Agidi. The fire chief said: “Just yesterday (Saturday), we received and attended to five distress calls, four of which were fire incidents at Awka, Nnewi, Onitsha and Awka, and the last a fallen petrol tanker at Ugwu Nwasike, Ogidi. “As at 5:30pm today (yesterday), we attended to three calls of fire outbreaks at Nise, Enugwu-Agidi and Nnewi. “Fire outbreaks do not just happen, they are caused by people’s mistakes. We need to be fire safety conscious now. We must know that fire kills but you can prevent it.”
