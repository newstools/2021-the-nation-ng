The Muaythai Federation of Nigeria (MFN) has uncovered a visa racketeering ring claiming to be muaythai athletes, in an attempt to get Egyptian visas. NMF president Paul Egonu speaking with the media, said about 30 individuals stormed the Egyptian Embassy in Nigeria claiming to be representatives of MFN going training camp. They allegedly submitted applications for visa by forging the MFN letter head and seal. Egonu said the federation has already written to the Egyptian embassy to notify them of the fraud, adding that none of the names listed for visa application is a member of the federation. “Muaythai in Nigeria operate under the name know as Muaythai Federation of Nigeria (MFN), not Nigeria Muaythai Federation as claimed by this individuals. MFN is a member international Federation of Muaythai Association IFMA, member World Muaythai Council WMC. “It is so unfortunate.  We are going to get to the bottom of it. Somebody needs to be arrested for giving us a bad image abroad. We have a bunch of fraudulent human beings whose job is to impersonate people, do visa racketeering and spoil the names of Nigeria in the world,” Egonu said.
