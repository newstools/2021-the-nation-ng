Zimbabwe’s foreign affairs minister Sibusiso Moyo died on Wednesday, a day after testing positive for the Coronavirus (COVID-19), acting chief secretary to the president and cabinet George Charamba said in a statement. A close family member of Moyo also confirmed the death to Xinhua. “It’s true my brother. COVID-19. He tested positive yesterday,” the family member said. He becomes the third government minister to succumb to COVID-19 since the pandemic hit the country in March 2020. The retired army Lieutenant-General was the face of the military operation that ousted former President Robert Mugabe in Nov. 2019. He went on to be part of current President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration. (Xinhua/NAN)
