The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) Edo State command, Mrs. Bridget Esene, has narrated how the five gunmen that abducted her on way to church in Benin on Sunday sold her in the forest to hardened kidnappers suspected to be herdsmen with a plot to kill her. The middle-aged woman also revealed she saw hell in the hands of the kidnappers, which she would never wish on her enemies before she was rescued around 4 pm on Tuesday by the police and vigilance members. She said: “My abductors were meant to assassinate me. The armed men, numbering five, trailed me to my church at Ikhueniro, Benin City, where they kidnapped me. “I was forced into their car and driven out of the church premises by the gunmen, who later sold me to another set of hardened kidnappers, who are suspected herdsmen. “Upon sighting the kidnappers, I attempted to escape, but I was intercepted at gunpoint by the hoodlums, who later took me into the forest. “Some fully-armed kidnappers were on the ground to receive me in the forest. Having been sold to the suspected herdsmen, I was moved deeper into the forest.” Family members confirmed huge ransom was paid before Esene regained her freedom. They however declined to mention the exact amount of money collected by the criminals. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of Edo Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, a Superintendent of Police (SP), confirmed the spokesperson of NIS in the state was rescued by the police and vigilance members but he was not forthcoming on the payment of ransom.
