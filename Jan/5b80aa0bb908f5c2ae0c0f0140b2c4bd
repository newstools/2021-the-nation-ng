Suspected hoodlums have kidnapped a mother of three, Mrs. Tina Etameta, at Ughelli in Ughelli North Local Government of Delta State. A source said Etameta, 44, was abducted at her shop opposite Agbarha-Otor junction, where she sells provisions. The source said the kidnappers arrived at the shop and shot sporadically into the air before they took the victim away to an unknown destination. The victim’s husband, Mr. Lucky Etemata, who witnessed the incident, said he escaped when the hoodlums were shooting, adding that his wife, who ran into the shop, was later abducted by the hoodlums, who wore masks. Attempt to reach police spokesman DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya failed,  but a senior officer attached to the Ughelli Area Command confirmed the incident. He said the police were on top of the matter.
