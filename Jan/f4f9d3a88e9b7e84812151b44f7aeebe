The Primate of The African Church, His Eminence, Julius Olayinka Osayande Abbe, has urged medical experts and health officials to carefully investigate the covid-19 vaccine before it will be administered in Nigeria. Speaking at The African Church, Bethlehem Cathedral, Ebute-Meta, Lagos, during his visit to the Lagos Central Diocese, the cleric said: “It is advisable for all African countries to be sure that the vaccine that will be administered to us is the same with what is being administered to people in developed countries before anyone receives it.” He assured members of the diocese that God would see Nigeria through the second wave of the pandemic. The primate said despite the fact that God would protect His people, believers should also ensure that they adhere strictly to the measures put in place by the government and maintain good personal hygiene. The bishop, who titled his message, ‘Sing a New Song,’ chose his text from Psalm 96: 1 – 4. He told the congregation that the greatest task anyone could do for God in 2021 is to praise and honour Him at all times. He highlighted three reasons why it is important to praise God in 2021. One, our salvation is assured. Two, God’s glory will become visible in one’s life and lastly for the continuation of all His wonderful works in our lives. Primate Abbe was warmly received by members of the diocese. He was full of appreciation to God and the diocese for their support over the years. In attendance at the service were the Bishop of the diocese, Dr. A. I. Dawodu; Vice Lay President, Dr. Segun Adenekan; Diocesan Secretary, Bro. Wale Soetan; Provost of the Cathedral, The Ven. E. O. Ogunbiyi; and Cathedral People’s Warden, Bro. Dotun Adekoya, among other prominent members.
