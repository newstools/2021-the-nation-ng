Nollywood actress Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde has given a blog, gistlovers, 24 hours to prove insinuation of a tie with a former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The 42-year-old shared a screenshot of the blog’s post on Instagram on Tuesday. She asked her followers to report the blog’s page on Instagram. “I ordinarily don’t do this but after thinking about it thoroughly and seeking advice i have decided to! So this Blog ran this story and people started coming to my page. “I’ve always known there are people who are sick and will tell you stories that have never happened but to publish that on a platform as big as Instagram? You must be held accountable,” she wrote. In another post, she told her fans not to tag her on such post again. “Still waiting for the so called blog to post their proof of their dirty insinuation. You don’t just wake up and randomly write nonsense! You will prove your story and be found,” she wrote.
