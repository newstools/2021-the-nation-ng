 Youths across the country under the auspices of ‘National Youth Conference’ have urged the new service chiefs to immediately hit the ground running in order to salvage the worsening security situation in the country. The youths who welcomed the new service chiefs, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for quickly responding to their demands by sacking the service chiefs and appointing new ones. Convener of the Group,  Dr Kassim Muhammad who is also the Chairman, Federal Special Public Works Programme, Nasarawa State,  stated this on Friday in his office in Lafia while interacting with newsmen on some of the demands made by Nigerian youths during the ENDSARS protests late last year. Kassim said that following the ENDSARS protest, he organised a national youth conference in December last year which brought all the youths across the country together to chat a way forward regarding the future of the youths in the country. According to him, “during the conference which I chaired as a youth, sacking of service chiefs as well as immediate resolution of  the ASUU crisis for our youths to return to their various campuses among so many other demands was reached through a communique. “I’m happy to inform you that President Muhammadu Buhari is a youth friendly president, he has already started the implementation of our resolutions, he has fired the service chiefs and appointed new ones, he has also resolved the ASUU strike and our students are back on campuses.” “ But one key thing he is yet to do which was a key factor that led to the ENDSARS protest is the setting up of a National Commission for Youths, through an executive bill to the National Assembly, we believe strongly that in the days ahead, the president who is a listening leader will send the bill to the national assembly, “ Kassim said.
