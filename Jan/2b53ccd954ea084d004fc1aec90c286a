The National Association of Private School Teachers (NAPST) has appealed to the Federal Government not to close down schools beyond Jan. 18 as a result of the second wave of the COVID-19. Its National President, Mr. Olumhense Akhigbe, made the call yesterday at a news conference on the plight of private school teachers in Abuja. Akhigbe said if ultimately schools would remain closed as a result of the second wave of coronavirus, there was need for government to come to the aid of the teachers. “If schools must be closed, then all private school teachers must as a matter of urgency be paid a monthly stipend for the time being. “This support will go a long way to save our lives, our jobs and the future of millions of Nigerian children in private schools,” he said. According to him, already most schools were supposed to resume on Jan. 4, but by government directive through the PTF, resumption was delayed till Jan. 18.
