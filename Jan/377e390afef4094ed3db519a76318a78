The Managing Director, Nigeria Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA) Prof. Adesoji Adesugba has described the N1.5 billion investment brought into the Kano Free Trade Zone by Sunbelt Free Zone Enterprise as an offshoot of sustained intervention. Adesugba stated this during a visit by the Executive Director and one of the promoters of the enterprise, Alhaji Murtala Jega, in Abuja, noting that Sunbelt, which specialises in the manufacturing of fabrics and textiles was licensed on December 12, 2019 as a firm owned by four investors including three Chinese and a Nigerian. Adesugba explained that the authority and the Ministry had collaborated  in executing President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive on using the scheme to generate employment for the country’s youths. According to him, when operational, Sunbelt can engage 3000 direct and indirect labour, adding that this is a  feat. This is the kind of investment the government is expecting from organisations to sustain the country.
