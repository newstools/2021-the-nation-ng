Manchester United held onto top spot in the Premier League after grinding out a dour 0-0 draw at title rivals Liverpool, while Tanguy Ndombele’s stunning strike sealed Tottenham’s 3-1 win at Sheffield United yesterday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side had the better chances in a strangely subdued clash between two of English football’s bitterest rivals. Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker saved well from Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba in the second half, but neither side deserved to win. United are three points clear of third placed Liverpool and two ahead of second placed Leicester. United are top after the New Year for the first time since Alex Ferguson’s retirement in 2013 thanks to nine wins in a 12-match unbeaten run.
