Full academic activities for the 2019/2020 Academic Session have commenced at the Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta (FUNAAB) with orientation for fresh students. The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Kolawole Salako, admonished the new students to take advantage of their virtual training to learn more about information technology. Salako said: “You need to take advantage of this virtual training because we are in the information technology world and a lot of you know that you cannot do without it. You are a generation already born into the age of information technology and we believe that you shall acclimatise to whatever media we are using to deliver the lectures to you.” The VC, however, warned the freshers not to take advantage of the non-physical presence of their lecturers to abuse the lecture timetables. The Vice-Chancellor stated further that the programmes were meant to prepare the over 4,000 incoming students ahead for the matriculation, stressing that without matriculation, they would not be regarded as bonafide students of the university. He urged them to listen to all that they would be taught during the exercise and also obey the COVID-19 protocols. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academics), Prof. Bolanle Akeredolu-Ale and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Development), Prof. Clement Adeofun, also addressed the students.
