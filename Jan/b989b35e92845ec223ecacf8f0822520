Nigerian players Wilfred Ndidi and Mikel Obi played full time on opposing sides as Leicester advanced into the FA Cup fourth round in comfortable fashion beating Stoke 4-0 at the bet365 Stadium. James Justin put the Foxes in front with a fine strike in the 34th minute, shortly after Sam Vokes had missed a good chance to give the Championship hosts the lead. Marc Albrighton doubled the advantage with a 59th-minute finish, Ayoze Perez made it 3-0 with 11 minutes of normal time to go, and Harvey Barnes added a fourth two minutes later. While Leicester were without Jamie Vardy and James Maddison, who had been nursing injuries, boss Brendan Rodgers named a strong team as that pair being replaced by Perez and Dennis Praet were the only changes from the 2-1 win at Newcastle.  Stoke manager Michael O’Neill made five alterations to his line-up from the 1-0 loss to Bournemouth, with skipper Ryan Shawcross being handed a first start of the season. Mikel had the contest’s first attempt on goal when he sent a shot over the visitors’ bar in the fourth minute. City headed into the game well aware of the Potters’ defensive strengths, and they knew it would take a moment of magic to open the scoring in Staffordshire. After the interval, Marc Albrighton’s first goal since Boxing Day 2018 doubled Leicester’s advantage, before efforts from Ayoze Pérez and Harvey Barnes sealed the triumph.
