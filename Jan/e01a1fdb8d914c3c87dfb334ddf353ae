Police Public Relations Officer of Taraba Command, DSP David Misal, confirmed the incident to The Nation at Jalingo Federal Medical Centre Mortuary. He said the gunmen invaded the deceased’s residence located at the Sabon-Gari area of Jalingo at about 1am on Sunday, shooting sporadically for over 30 minutes before abducting the council boss.
