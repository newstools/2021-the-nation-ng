Tottenham’s Harry Kane could be out for a “few weeks” after injuring both ankles in the Premier League defeat by Liverpool, says his boss Jose Mourinho. Kane, 27, needed treatment on his left ankle after landing awkwardly following a challenge with Jordan Henderson. The England captain also hurt his right ankle in an earlier challenge with Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara. The striker, who has a history of ankle issues, continued before being replaced by Erik Lamela at half-time. “The second injury was worse than the first one,” said Mourinho. “He was coping with one but couldn’t cope with both. “For Harry to leave a game when the team is losing is not a nothing injury. “There are some players you can’t replace. When it happens it happens, but I believe we have to fight against it, we cannot do anything else.” Kane has spent considerable time on the sidelines with a number of serious ankle injuries in recent seasons. The striker was ruled out for two significant spells in the second half of the 2018-19 season, missing seven games when he damaged ligaments in his left ankle in January 2019 and then nine more matches with a lateral ligament injury sustained in April. In 2017-18 he missed a month with a similar injury to the right ankle, and endured separate absences of six and four weeks during the 2016-17 campaign. BBC
