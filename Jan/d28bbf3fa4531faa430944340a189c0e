 Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers believes injuries to Wilfred Ndidi and Jonny Evans are not serious as he praises his side’s response to falling behind at Everton to earn draw Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers was pleased with the way his side reacted to going behind in their 1-1 draw at Everton on Wednesday night. The Toffees took the lead through James Rodriguez on the half-hour mark but Youri Tielemans equalised in the second half to earn a point for the Foxes at Goodison Park. Rodgers was satisfied with his team’s performance and felt with a touch more good fortune they would have left with three points at Everton. The Foxes lost midfielder Wilfred Ndidi to a hamstring injury just before half-time and centre back Jonny Evans had to be substituted in the second half but Rodgers believes neither setback is serious. “It’s just tightened up,” Rodgers said of Ndidi. “He doesn’t think he’s overstretched or tore it. We’ll just have to assess that. We couldn’t risk it. “Evans had blurred vision in one eye after he went up for a header,” he noted.
