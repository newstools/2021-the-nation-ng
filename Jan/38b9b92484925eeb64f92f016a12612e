To further push for the realisation of the presidential ambition of Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello, the Speaker of Kogi State House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole, with some leaders of the House, on Thursday paid a courtesy visit to Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom at Government House Makurdi; the state capital. The Kogi State delegation, which was in Makurdi to consult  with, and seek the support of the leadership of the Benue State House of Assembly for Governor Bello in the 2023 Presidential election, was accompanied to the Benue People’s House by the Speaker, Benue State House of Assembly, Titus Uba and members of the House. Kolawole told the governor, who was represented by his deputy, Benson Abounu  that they were in the state to interface with their colleagues in the House, and seek their support, and that of the people of the North Central geo-political zone for the candidacy of Governor Bello. Governor Ortom welcomed the team to the state and wished them well. He said it was heartwarming that though they belong to different political parties, they still visited him. He stated that the question of who occupies what leadership position rests solely with God.
