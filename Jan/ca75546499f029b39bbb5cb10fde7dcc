Wife of Niger State Governor, Dr Amina Abubakar Bello has set up a safe shelter for victims of gender-based violence. Bello set up the safe shelter through her non-governmental organisation, RAISE Foundation. The safe house, according to the foundation, is meant to safeguard the lives of victims of gender-based violence from their perpetrators and help them to heal. Chief Operating Officer of RAISE Foundation, Mrs Toyin Dawudu made this disclosure during the stakeholders meeting of Women-led Integrated Protection Against Gender-Based Violence (WIPe-GBV)  in the state. She said that a woman cannot heal if she is told to return to the environment where she was being abused, as there is a likelihood that the abuse may continue. “Because of the need to keep victims of gender-based violence safe from their abusers, RAISE Foundation renovated a safe house for the victim. The operations are under the ministry of women affairs. “The safe house came to be because we realized that it is not okay for someone who has been abused and is still being abuser to return to where she has been abused. We noted the need to remove the survivor from the abusive environment as a change of environment is part of the healing process.”
