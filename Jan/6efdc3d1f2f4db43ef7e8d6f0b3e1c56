 LAGOS State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has spoken about what his administration has done to make the state a safe place for residents. He said besides strengthening security, his administration plans to improve efficiency of the security architecture. The governor, who spoke on a live television programme, “Sunday Politics”, anchored by Channels Television, said Lagos would continue to push for domestication of state policing as a strategy to combat crime and beef up security. He stressed the need to employ technology in intelligence gathering, noting that the government was on the verge of rolling out 2,000 security cameras across communities through the Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF). Sanwo-Olu said: “One of the things we can do quickly is to improve the ratio of police to citizens’ number. This has not happened in a number of years. We believe Lagos is under-policed, even as population increases. If we address this imbalance through state policing model, we can see a turnaround in security response. We are ready to have this conversation with the police whenever they are ready.” “In our Smart City project, we are installing 2,000 high-definition security cameras to boost security architecture. We are set and before the end of the year, a lot of cameras will be on our streets. Technology is one of the things we can use to provide security. With the data from the cameras, we can prevent crimes.”
