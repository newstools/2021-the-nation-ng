Instagram 2-0 Tunde’ @AsiwajuLerry said “Tunde Ednut opened a new account and started trolling Wizkid again. He even blocked Macaroni all because he said he should be nice to people. Life comes at you real quick.” @itzbasito said, “Mr Macaroni posted Tunde Ednut and made a video for him when he opened his new account, Tunde Ednut got 500k followers in less than 24 hours, then he deleted Mr Macaroni’s video on his page and blocked him.Now his account has been suspended at 1m followers.” @danieliyam said “Tunde Ednut is having content rights ownership issues. That’s the major reason Instagram is picking on him.”
