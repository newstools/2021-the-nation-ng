 PRESIDENT Muhmmadu Buhari has directed state governments to domesticate the Disability Act to make the establishment of the National Commission for Persons with Disabilities perform its responsibility. The President spoke on Thursday when he hosted members of the newly established commission, led by the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq, at the State House in Abuja. A statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said President Buhari praised some governors for enacting laws on disability and enjoined those who have not, to do the needful. The President expressed joy that the commission was in place, as it was among vital issues he spoke about during his electioneering campaigns. “In December 2014, during my campaign for the President of this country under our great party, I met with the Community of Persons with Special Needs who showed unalloyed loyalty and support for our party and my candidature in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital. “I recall that the most pressing and priority request from the community was the passage of the Disability Bill and the subsequent presidential assent, which I promised them I would do. I am happy to have fulfilled that promise. “I thank the governors of Plateau, Lagos and Nasarawa states for enacting disability laws and establishing Disability Rights Commissions in their states. I am calling on governors of Yobe, Kano and Kogi states, to implement their laws while those states that are yet to do so should take necessary action to enable the Federal Government efforts have the desired impact at the subnational levels,” President Buhari said.
