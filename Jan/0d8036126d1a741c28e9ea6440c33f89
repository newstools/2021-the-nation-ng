BUA Cement Plc has concluded its N115billion Series 1 Fixed Rate Senior Unsecured Bond Issue. It is under its maiden N200billion Bond Issuance Programme. With the development, BUA Cement’s Series 1 Bond becomes the largest ever- corporate bond issued in the Nigerian debt capital markets and signposts growing investor confidence in the county’s second largest cement company. According to the company, an application will be made to dual-list the bonds on the relevant exchanges upon receiving the approvals. BUA Cement’s N100 billion Series 1, seven-year issue priced at 7.5 per cent and was oversubscribed  by N137.82billion just as the company announced that it would only utilise N115billion in line with the guidelines. Chairman, BUA Cement, Abdul Samad Rabiu said: “This is the largest corporate bond offering in the history of Nigeria’s debt capital markets. Last year, we made a strategic decision as a proudly Nigerian company to list BUA Cement on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. This was in line with our core strategy to continue seeking out viable investment and growth opportunities within Nigeria. This bond issuance – a first by BUA Cement, demonstrates our confidence in Nigeria’s debt capital markets as well as continued investor confidence in the BUA Cement business model, our management team, and long-term strategy, all supported by strong credit ratings. We remain committed to unlocking opportunities within the industry for Nigeria.” Chief Executive Officer, BUA Cement, Yusuf Binji, said the success of the first series in the BUA Cement Bond Issuance Programme underscored the strength of the BUA Cement brand. “The transaction, being the largest corporate bond issuance in the history of Nigeria’s debt capital markets, reiterates the strength and acceptance of the BUA Cement brand and the trust placed by stakeholders in the Company’s strong cash generation capacity, credit profile and strategy driven by a well experienced management team. ‘’Diversifying and extending the duration of our funding sources with the inclusion of this bond, at a competitive rate, will further enable us to achieve our strategic objectives and vision.”
