Former Imo Governor Senator Rochas Okorocha has said he is still a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Imo West Senator also asked the public to disregard the speculation he has plans to leave the party. Okorocha, who gave the clarification while addressing the State Working Committee (SWC) members, zonal, LGA and ward executives of his faction of the party in the state at the weekend, stated nobody has stake in APC more than himself. According to him: “I have not left APC. I am still in APC. Nobody has stakes in APC more than me. The worst insults I had in Imo and in the South-East in 2015 was because of APC and President Muhammadu Buhari. “APC was formed by President Buhari, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, myself and few other people. But those on congratulation trip have taken over the party”. Okorocha also revealed Buhari was not aware of the injustice being meted out to the elected APC executives in Imo from the state to the ward levels.
