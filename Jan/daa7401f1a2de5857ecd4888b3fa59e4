Portugal’s largest builder Mota-Engil MOTA.LS has won the contract to build a railway line between Nigeria and neighbouring Niger, Nigeria’s Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi said. The contract, which will link the northern Nigerian city of Kano with Niger’s Maradi, is expected to be worth nearly $2 billion, according to a budget approved by Nigeria’s Federal Executive Council last year. “Today, we signed the contract documents for the commencement of the Kano-Maradi, Kano-Dutse railway project,” Amaechi wrote in a tweet. Mota-Engil had also agreed to build a university as part of the agreement, he added.
