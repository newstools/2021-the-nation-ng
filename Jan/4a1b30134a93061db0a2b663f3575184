 Taiwo Awoniyi is unfazed how he scored his fifth goal in seven Bundesliga games this season last weekend. Awoniyi, with a goal and an assist, was the hero for Union Berlin as they recorded a 2-0 road win against Werder Bremen. Goals from the Liverpool loanee and Sheraldo Becker helped Union Berlin continue their remarkable start to the season by cruising to a comfortable win at the Wohninvest Weserstadion on Saturday. Twelve minutes in, Awoniyi and Becker found themselves in a two-v-two against the Bremen defence and the Nigerian set up his strike partner. Four minutes later, the Liverpool loanee missed a chance to make it 2-0 when he shot over the target, but it wasn’t long before he doubled the advantage as he poked the ball past goalkeeper Pavlenka from Robert Andrich’s pass in the box just before the 30-minute mark. Awoniyi has now scored in his last three league matches, and in his last four away games. “When I saw the ball, I noticed that if I took one more touch the keeper might come out,” Awoniyi, a 2013 U17 World Cup winner, told Bundesliga.com after the game. “Then I just had to kick the ball with my toe and it went in. “I was really happy about that because a goal is a goal no matter how it goes into the net.” After 14 games, Union Berlin are fourth in the provisional standings with 24 points before they host Wolfsburg on January 9.
