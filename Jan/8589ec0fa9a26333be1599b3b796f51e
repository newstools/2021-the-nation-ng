First Interim Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Osun State Governor Bisi Akande has said he preferred Nigerians to pray against COVID-19 pandemic than visiting him during his 82nd birthday celebration. Akande said this in a statement issued yesterday by his media aide, Mr. Adelani Baderinwa, to commemorate his 82nd birthday anniversary. He also enjoined leaders to make Nigeria a leading light globally, where collective interest override personal goal. “My desire is for a healthy nation. So, I prefer to have the prayers for Nigeria as birthday gift than visitations and merry-making. Nigerians should engage in fervent prayers for the quick end to the COVID-19 pandemic on January 16, 2021, on my 82nd birthday,” the APC chieftain said. Akande sympathised with those who lost their loved ones to the dreaded disease, prayed for quick recovery of those undergoing treatment, congratulated those who had been successfully treated and prayed for an end to the pandemic. He urged Nigerians to adhere to safety protocols of handwashing, use of facemask, use of hand sanitiser and maintaining of social distancing. Akande noted that the Chief Imam of Ila-Orangun, Alhaji Salaudeen Àbdulamid, will lead Muslims in a special prayer at the Ila Orangun Central Mosque on Friday. The Christian Association of Nigeria, Ila Local Government Branch, led by Rev. Father Joseph Oxhonogoh, will also conduct special prayers in churches on Sunday.
