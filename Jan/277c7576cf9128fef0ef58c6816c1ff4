 Enyimba pulled a 2-1 victory over Al Merreikh of Sudan in Aba yesterday but the victory was not enough to see the two-time Champions League winners into the group stage of the championship. The People’s Elephants who lost 3-0 away in the first leg, will now drop off to the second tier CAF Confederation Cup following a 2-4 aggregate loss to the Sudanese side. Interestingly, it was the visitors that equally opened scoring as early as the seven minutes in Aba through danger man Saif Terry the danger man of Al Merreikh who grabbed a hat-trick in the first leg.  Victor Mbaoma drew Enyimba level seven minutes and later grabbed his brace of the evening in the 51st minute when he converted a penalty after Samad Kadiri was tripped inside the box. The team captured the event of the day in a short submission on twitter @EnyimbaFC saying: “A win today but not enough to see us through to the group stage.” Enyimba posted their best performance in the Champions about 18 years ago when they won the championship back to back 2003 and 2004. But they now await their next opponents in the Confederation Cup as the draw hold on Friday.
