Former National Chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) Senator Victor Umeh, has implored Nigerians to  show love towards one another and offer selfless service to humanity for the sake of societal growth and development. Umeh, a consummate politician, who actively represented Anambra Central Senatorial District in the 8th Senate for seventeen months, made the call in his New Year Message to Nigerians. The ex-parliamentarian noted that engaging in acts of love and selflessness would go a long way in ensuring peace and unity among the citizens. He said being alive to witness the New Year was only a privilege, and therefore, should be enough reason to roll out the drums for celebration and in thanksgiving to God, adding that many could not make it to see 2021. Umeh said: “It is with great joy that I wish to congratulate everyone who was able to see the year 2020 come to an end and the beginning of a brand new year 2021 which optimistically, will be better and prosperous. “It is obvious that the previous year was not without many untoward situations ranging from the adverse effects of the novel Coronavirus pandemic to economic instabilities as well as the breakdown of law and order during the Endsars protest by Nigerian youths. Indeed, being alive and healthy to see this New Year is a privilege and enough reason to celebrate because many could not make it. He added: “I urge everyone to enter the New Year with positive mindset and optimism for a more peaceful, prosperous and resplendent year ahead. Having said that, we should endeavor to live upright and eschew acts inimical to individual and collective progress. Let’s prioritise acts of love and selfless deeds towards one another and for our society.
