 It is becoming clearer that Odion Ighalo’s loan spell at Old Trafford won’t be extended beyond the end of January. With several speculations about his next club but a return to China doesn’t look certain, while he could be left with a decision between taking one final giant payday and looking to make a mark in a European league. Sporx has indicated that Turkish giants Besiktas are hopeful of bringing him to the club, but finances are an issue and they’ll need to reach some kind of agreement over his wages. The report actually states that Mario Mandzukic was their main target but they couldn’t offer him enough money, so there will be a similar situation with Ighalo where he’ll need to take a pay cut or his Chinese club will need to cover the bulk of his wages. At this point it sounds like they are only looking to take him on a six month loan deal until the end of the season, while they’ll need to wait until the end of January to secure the signing when his loan spell at United ends. Ighalo did have a bright opening at Old Trafford and he scored a couple of nice goals, but he’s barely been used at all this season so it wouldn’t make any sense for United to extend his stay. Besiktas are currently tied at the top of the table with Fenerbahce who’ve just added Mesut Ozil to boost their title bid, so it’s clear that they want to add an attacking force of their own to help them regain the league title.
