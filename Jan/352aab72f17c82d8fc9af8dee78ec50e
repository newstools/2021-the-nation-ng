  Ekiti State House of Assembly Service Commission yesterday sacked 21 workers for offences, including irregular appointment, absenteeism and other allegations that contravened its condition of service. The Chairman, Taiwo Olatunbosun, said in a statement in Ado-Ekiti that the decision was taken in compliance with the report of staff audit undertaken as part of the efforts to reorganise the commission for effective service delivery. He added that the audit, which started last year on assumption of office of the current commission members, engaged the services of auditors over complaints, agitations and petitions from members of staff on allegations of absenteeism, arbitrary promotion and placement of officers above colleagues without regards to scheme of service. The dismissed workers protested against the House of Assembly over their “unjust dismissal” from the service of the House. The protest, led by labour leaders, was held on the premises of the assembly complex, where they chanted derisive songs to castigate the commission over the action. Addressing the dismissed workers, the Secretary of the Ekiti State Joint Negotiating Council, Gbenga Olowoyo, said it was wrong for the commission to have speedily sent the names of the affected workers to the accountant general to stop their salaries, while negotiation lasted.          Said he: “We are here to express our rejection of the summary dismissal of these 21 workers of the House of Assembly. Although the commission denied ever sacking anyone, which was not true. “We learnt from good authority that they have forwarded their names to the accountant general to stop their salaries, while also denied access to the assembly complex despite being employed and put on the payroll for 10 years. “We are not saying the commission cannot audit its workers, but it has to be with human face. We are going to fight to the end. We are not afraid of victimisation. The workers in the civil service will join them in solidarity. We are building career here and we won’t allow any politician to destroy us.” The Secretary of Trade Union Congress (TUC), Lawrence Kuloogun and that of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Taiwo Akinyemi, said the sacking of the workers was not only inhuman, but also embarrassing to the workforce. They said: “This is an injustice harassment and embarrassment of our workers. At Ekiti State University, we buried scores of our workers. The same happened at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital. This was because of sack. But here at the assembly, we are not ready to bury anybody. “The commission must reverse to status quo. They should not distribute any letter any more and they must retrieve the ones already served, for our workers to live good and worthy lives.”.
