 A SUSPECTED kidnapper, who was abducted by another kidnapper, has secured his freedom with a N1.5 million ransom. Mohammed Amodu paid N1.555 million before his captor Buba Babu set him free. Force spokesman CP Frank Mba, who paraded the suspects alongside others in Abuja yesterday, said Babu was notorious for highway kidnapping around Abuja. Babu, he said, was third-in-command of a kidnap syndicate headed by one Buji, who was neutralised by the police alongside the second-in-command. Mba said Babu took leadership of the gang and was notorious for always killing kidnap victims. Babu took Amodu into custody and shot him in the arm when his victim hesitated to pay. Mba said Amodu had boasted he had charms and could not be shot and Babu shot him to show he was serious. The police spokesman said Babu had strong links to a major terror group in northern Nigeria. Amodu was known as “Confirm” and had a reputation for marksmanship in the underworld. “Yet he was kidnapped and held and was released after he paid N1.55 million ,” Mba said. Amodu said he was kidnapped after supplying 90 rounds of live ammuntion to Babu. He said he witnessed an operation where Buba kidnapped 55 persons from a luxurious bus at a time. Also speaking, Buba said he had been kidnapping for three years, adding that as a kingpin he sent his boys for operations along major roads and never operated within the town. He said he broke off from Buji to form his own gang because of unfairness in sharing ransom money.
