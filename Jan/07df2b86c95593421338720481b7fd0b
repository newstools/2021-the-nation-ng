The Dangote Group has completed Nigeria’s longest rigid pavement in Kogi State. It is the first of its kind, according to top engineers. The 43-kilometre Obajana-Kabba road, built by Dangote Industries Limited (DIL), has been described by motorists as the country’s most strategic highway in aiding travelers between the North and the South. Project Director Olatunbosun Kalejaiye said he was excited that the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project was delivered for use by Nigerians. He added that while the rigid pavement had been completed, the company was dressing the shoulders. Site Engineer Samuel Obosi said the dual carriage way will be durable and less susceptible to potholes and repairs, like asphalt road. “Thank God, it is a concrete road. It can withstand any heavy duty vehicle,” Alhaji Lamidi Sikiru, a driver said. A member of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), John Moses, said his taxi business was booming, compared to when the road was in deplorable condition with potholes and was avoided by motorists. A community leader in Apa Bunu Kingdom and spokesperson Sam Omosayil said the road had attracted a lot of businesses to the area. Traditional and community leaders eulogised President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote. The Bajana of Obajana land, King Idowu Senibi, described the project as gigantic and the first of its kind in Nigeria. “Dangote is our son. We would protect his huge investment and gigantic concrete road. I am happy that this is happening in my lifetime and in my kingdom. This is a great opportunity for us and many generations to  come,” he said.
