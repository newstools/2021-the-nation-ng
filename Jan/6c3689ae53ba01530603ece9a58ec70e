The Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) has said that there was no eviction order to herdsmen in Ondo State or any part of the South West region. It said the speech of Ondo Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, was misconstrued in the media and was only directed at government reserve including registration. Chairman of NGF and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, spoke in Akure at a meeting with the national leadership of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN). Dr. Fayemi noted that the statement generated a lot of hoopla which led to what he described as unfortunate development in Oyo State. He said Akeredolu didnâ€™t talk about herdsmen vacating the state but about registration of herdsmen who want to operate within the reserves. The Ekiti Governor said they are after criminals and not fulani herdsmen.
