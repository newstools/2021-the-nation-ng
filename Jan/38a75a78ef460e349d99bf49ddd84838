Governors of the Southeast are putting finishing touches to the Southeast security outfit,  their Chairman, Dave Umahi, has said. He added that  already procured uniforms for the personnel and operational vehicles would be rolled out in a few weeks. According to him, leaders of the zone would soon meet to give the security outfit a name. Umahi, who stated  this  after the state’s  security council meeting in äbårå, Ohaozara Local Government Area yesterday, also claimed that there was an “orchestrated plan” by political elements “ to portray Ebonyi and  its governor in a negative light “ He added that  his security aides and those of his colleagues  were being retrained to “ensure adequate protection of lives and properties within the Southeast.” His words: “Southeast governors have had a series of meetings on security. We are presently circulating samples of uniforms which is going to be common for the entire zone. We also have on display, vehicles that will also be common for the entire Southeast. “We have arranged for the training and retraining of all the security outfits of the governors in the southeast. “In  a few weeks to come, we are going to roll out these uniforms and vehicles to further deepen our efforts in security architecture in the entire Southeast. “The security outfit is going to have one name. The governors and leaders of Southeast will meet and they will come up with the name. The most critical are the vehicles and  uniforms.”
