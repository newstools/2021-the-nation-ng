FC Vizela have confirmed the signing of Nigerian youngster Emmanuel Adeyemo from Tripple 44 Academy. The 18-year-old will remain at the Estadio do Futebol Clube de Vizela until 2024 having penned a four-year deal with the Portuguese second division outfit for an undisclosed fee. Adeyemo had been on the radar of Vizela since embarking on a training tour at Swedish elite division side BK Hacken in 2018. Tripple 44 boss Samuel Olatunji-Okuku confirmed this development to Goal, while explaining why his academy settled for Vizela despite offers from Porto amongst other clubs. “Everything has been settled and Emmanuel Adeyemo is now a player of Portuguese club FC Vizela,” Olatunji-Okuku told Goal. “Vizela spotted him almost the same time FC Porto came calling, however, we concluded that he would join the former where he would get regular playing time that will hasten his development. “Also, they had to wait for almost a year for Emmanuel to get a work permit and that tells you how much they wanted him.” In the same vein, manager Carlos Cunha believes the youngster’s addition will add more bite to his team owing to his “remarkable” qualities. “Emma is no doubt a great addition to this team because of remarkable attributes,” Cunha told Goal. “Aside from his height, he is very strong, mobile and he boasts of an uncommon ability to pass forward no matter. That is one aspect I love about his game “He reads the game very well not forgetting the fact that he is a very hard working lad. I look forward to working with him as well as his new teammates.” With this move, Adeyemo joins former Nigeria U17 and U20 star Musa Yahaya in the squad that boasts of several African players like Hugues Evrard (Cote d’Ivoire), Mohamed Aidara (Cote d’Ivoire), Richard Ofori (Ghana), Ericson Silva (Cape Verde), Koffi Kouao (Cote d’Ivoire), Emmanuel Oti (Ghana) and Emmanuel Cann (Ghana).
