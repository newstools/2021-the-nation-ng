Twitter has given US president-elect Joe Biden his new official presidential account, although he will start it with zero followers. The Biden campaign is unhappy with the move, which marks a change from the previous transition from Barack Obama. The new account, @PresElectBiden, will transform into the official @POTUS (President of the United States) one on inauguration day on 20 January. In its first six hours online it gained nearly 400,000 followers. Mr. Biden’s own account has 24 million followers. His team has also registered new accounts – @FLOTUSBiden for the future first lady, Jill Biden, and for the first time, @SecondGentleman, for Ms Harris’s husband Doug Emhoff. Donald Trump inherited the Potus account’s 13 million or so followers when it moved to him from Mr Obama – but that will not happen this time. Mr Biden’s team was told about the move less than a month ago, and said it meant “the administration will have to start from zero”.
