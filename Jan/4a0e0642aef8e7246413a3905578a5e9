 SACKED chairmen of the 22 local government areas of Rivers State, belonging to the All Progressives Congress (APC) have warned against the conduct of another council elections when a related matter is pending in court. The chairmen were sacked in a judgment by Justice Lambert Akanbi of the Federal High Court in 2015. Chairman of the group Sogbeye Eli, at a news conference yesterday, reiterated the earlier position of the Isaac Ogbogbule-led caretaker committee that the party would not be a part of the February elections. The aggrieved politicians regretted the anti-party activities of some party members, especially Ben Chioma and Igo Aguma of the Senator Magnus Abe-led faction, who are insisting on participating in the polls ‘while the party is challenging the illegal nullification of an election that was valid and held in accordance with the constitution and the electoral act’. Eli described their colleagues as impostors who are working hard to keep the party down. He called on the National caretaker chairman, Mai Mala Buni, to forward a letter to the RSIEC to officially inform them that the APC is not interested in the election and will not participate. They said: “The APC in Rivers State will boycott the proposed council elections because participating in that election means endorsing illegality and also compromising our suit challenging the illegal cancellation of our mandates in the Appeal Court…”
