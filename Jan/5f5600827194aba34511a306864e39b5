The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has advised sick and too old people to henceforth stay away from worship centres. This was part of the guidelines released by CAN to churches following the second wave of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. CAN appealed to Christians to keep adhering to the laydown protocols by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 to curb the spread of the pandemic. A statement issued by CAN’s General Secretary, Joseph Daramola said: “Brethren, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 has announced the emergence of the second wave of the pandemic. We appeal to all our churches to observe all the COVID-19 protocols, which include the following: “There should be no entry without facemasks. All worshippers, including the worship leaders, must wear face masks.  There should be no exceptional cases. “People who are sick or too old should stay at home. There should be temperature screening at every entry point to the church. “Ensure adequate ventilation in halls of worship, open windows, and doors for air to circulate in and out freely and if possible avoid the use of air conditioners. Hand washing facilities and hand sanitisers should be provided at the point of entries and strategic points within the church premises. “Attendance should not exceed 1/3 of the sitting capacity of every church. Churches can make use of their educational facilities and multi-purpose halls to avoid overcrowding in the main church auditorium. “Church auditorium should be clearly marked such that people sit and maintain two metres distance from each other.” CAN said that there should be no form of direct contact and practices such as handshakes as peace signs are discouraged, adding that sanitisers should be made available in all the restrooms.
