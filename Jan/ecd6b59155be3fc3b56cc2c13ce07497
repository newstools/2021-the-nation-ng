 Super Eagles forward Paul Onuachu continues his fine form in the Belgian Jupiler league after scoring for KRC Genk against Kortrijk on Saturday. With the goal, the Nigerian striker has now scored his 19th  league goal of the season from just 18 appearances. Onuachu’s previous best record was when he scored 18 goals in 36 games for Midtjylland during the 2016-17 Danish Superliga campaign. The game ended 2-1 in the favour of the Kortrijk’s, but Genk retained their second position on the league table. Onuachu’s compatriot Cyriel Dessers came off the bench as a 60th-minute substitute. In France, Terem Moffi scored for the third game in a row as Lorient fell to a narrow 2-1 defeat at Bordeaux which featured Samuel Kalu for 61 minutes and saw Josh Maja coming four minutes before the end of regulation time.
