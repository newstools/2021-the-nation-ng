Osun State Commissioner for Health Dr. Rafiu Isamotu has announced that five persons have died from COVID-19-related complications within 24 hours. A statement by Isamotu to reporters said the death of the five persons accounted for 33.3 per cent of the 15 deaths recorded in Nigeria in the last 24 hours. He noted that the new record saw the state’s COVID-19-related deaths galloping to 32 out of the 1,458 confirmed cases since March 2020 when the index case was recorded. “The report of increased fatalities was a warning sign to citizens not to treat COVID-19 with kid-gloves. Osun was one of the least hit by the infection during the first wave. This is despite the state’s timely and effective interception of the Ivory Coast returnees, which we took responsibility for,” Isamotu stated
