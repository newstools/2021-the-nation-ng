 Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has dissolved all standing committees of the House and observers of the politics of the legislative house are left wondering whether the development is a sign of peace or more trouble. The House has been troubled of recent with the Speaker battling some prominent lawmakers. In the process, some principal officers were removed from their positions and promptly replaced by loyalists of the Obasa. Some were also sent on indefinite suspension. Following intervention by the leadership of APC in the state, a truce was reached and those on suspension were recalled. But those who lost their positions were not returned amidst talks that the party has asked the Speaker to find a way of appeasing them. With nothing done in that direction for months, talk of a fresh face-off lingered. It is now left to be seen if the Speaker’s move is an olive branch or a fresh declaration of hostilities. Announcing the dissolution, shortly after the 2021 Appropriation of the House was passed, Obasa said “all the standing committees of the House are hereby dissolved, while all the committee chairmen and members are to function in acting capacity.” Some observers said the Speaker may be out to compensate his erstwhile rivals with juicy committee positions. But others fear he may be out to further displace his critics and position his loyalists. Time will surely reveal whatever is to come.
