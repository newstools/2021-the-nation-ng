 TWO suspects are now in police custody for allegedly issuing fake COVID-19 test results in the name of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), the agency’s Director-General, Prof. Babatunde Salako, said on Friday. Salako broke the news to reporters against the backdrop of allegations of issuance of fake COVID-19 test results by the institute. The Lagos State Government first raised the alarm penultimate Friday over sales of fake COVID-19 test results in the state. The state government said that processes were being put in place to clamp down on both buyers and sellers. Salako said: “On Dec. 29, 2020, TVC Communications aired a news report entitled ‘How officials issue fake COVID-19 result without test in Nigeria’ wherein it alleged sharp practices at our testing site . “As an institute with an unblemished reputation whose vision is promotion of national health and development, it raises a serious concern that our efforts are being sabotaged. “We immediately set up an investigative committee headed by Prof. Stella Smith, to come up with facts on the truism or otherwise of the allegation. “A thorough investigation by the committee revealed that two individuals who were neither staff nor agents of NIMR are behind the issuance of the fake results without testing. “The suspects namely Enoch Basyan and Fazing Binrah were caught in the act while trying to do COVID-19 test for one of our staff who acted as a patient at the front of a bank at Isolo. “The suspects are currently at Aswani Police Station and will face the law.”
