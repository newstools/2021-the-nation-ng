 Mischief-makers are having a field day discussing what they described as the ‘final return’ of former Ogun State Governor, Ibikunle Amosun, to the All Progressives Congress (APC). This started after all seven lawmakers elected under the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) in the state decamped to APC during the plenary on Thursday at the House of Assembly Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. The Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo while reading their letters of defection, stated that the lawmakers in their correspondences, noted that they took the decision after due consultation with their leaders and constituents. The legislators are Amosun Yusuf, Modupe Mujota, Musefiu Lamidi, Ajayi Bolanle, Ganiyu Oyedeji, Ajibola Sikiratu and Ademola Adeniran. It would be recalled that Amosun, then as governor and APC senatorial candidate, ordered the lawmakers and all his allies and supporters to dump APC and join APM, following the failure of his preferred candidate to pick the ruling party’s gubernatorial ticket. They have remained in APM ever since while Amosun stayed in APC. Thus, many see their return as confirmation the former governor is ready to play the politics of the ruling party henceforth. With the defection, the 26 membership house now consists of 22 APC lawmakers, three African Democratic Congress (ADC) and a member from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
