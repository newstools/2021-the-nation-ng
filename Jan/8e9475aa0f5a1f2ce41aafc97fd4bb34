The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Cross River has refuted claims that some members tested positive for coronavirus at the ongoing orientation exercise. In a statement by Assistant Director Press and Public Relations unit Enuma Peter, the NYSC authorities declared emphatically “there is no COVID-19 positive Corps Members in Cross River State NYSC Orientation Camp.” The clarification followed reports alleging 13 Corps members undergoing Orientation Course in the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp in Obubra Local Government Area tested positive for COVID-19 in the state. The statement reads: “At no time was registered Corps Members tested positive as everyone was tested before admittance to the camp. The management of the NYSC would also like to use this opportunity to add that all orientation camp officials and visitors to the camp are also continuously tested by officials of the NCDC while the entire camp community ensures strict compliance to all COVID-19 protocols. “For emphasis, all Corps members undergoing the NYSC Orientation Course in Cross River State tested negative to COVID-19 before they were registered.”
