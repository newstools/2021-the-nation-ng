The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 on Tuesday said the January 18 resumption date for schools remains unchanged. Its National Coordinator, Dr Sani Aliyu, stated this while featuring on a television programme. Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, said on Monday that the resumption was subject to review. A section of the media (not The Nation) misquoted him as saying that school resumption has been postponed indefinitely. But Aliyu clarified that the Minister of Education did not say the date had been changed. He said: “What the minister said was that they were going to review the date; he didn’t say that they were going to change it. “He said they would review the situation and let the nation know. So, for the moment, it is still 18th January until the Ministry of Education comes back either with an alternative date or reconfirms that.” Aliyu said Nigerians will determine the imposition of a fresh lockdown through their compliance or non-compliance with COVID-19 protocols. He said that no decision has been taken on whether a fresh lockdown would be imposed.
