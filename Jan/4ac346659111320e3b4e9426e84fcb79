  POLITICAL bigwigs in Adamawa State who have been officially received as defectors from other parties to the All Progressives Congress (APC) have vowed to play down on their personal ambitions to present a united APC against governing Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The politicians and all followers of political events in Adamawa State are of the view that disunity within the APC caused it the 2019 election in the state. One of the returnees to the APC Abdulaziz Nyako is said to be a major factor. Senator Abdulaziz Nyako, who had left the APC towards the 2019 elections to become the governorship candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC) and who led the ADC to fuse into the APC during the weekend, said he and other prominent politicians coming into the APC resolved to forge a united front against the PDP. “From today, we are full-fledged APC members. We must use this reunion to work and produce credible aspirants to contest elective positions in 2023,” Abdulaziz said. The formal reception for the new APC members which took place at the APC state secretariat in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, was also attended by Senator Ishaku Abbo who officially defected to the APC from the PDP, and former governor Bala Ngillari who also joined the APC from the PDP. Abbo, who had differences with his former party, the PDP and Governor Ahmadu Fintiri even while he was in that party, spoke excitedly of the need to get the PDP out of power in 2023.
