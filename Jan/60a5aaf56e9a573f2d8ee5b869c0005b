 I have never done something like this before,” were the words of Similoluwa Hassan, the lead character of ‘Training Day,’ a short film directed by Tolulope Ajayi. Speaking further during a media parley, Hassan who played the character, Mr Rogers, in the short film narrated: “The subject matter and messages encoded in the film is critical and connects with happenings in our everyday life. The film is more relevant now than it was six months ago as you can relate it to current happenings in Nigeria with a key focus on the recent protests.” The brainchild of Paradigm Initiative also features Tomiwa Tegbe, who played the role of Jude. Speaking about the film, Thobekile Matimbe, the Community Manager at Paradigm Initiative, said: “Digital rights are human rights and they have become increasingly violated in Africa, with rights-limiting legislation, internet shutdowns, and other violations regularly headlining international media reporting. The film was our way to get the 2019 Digital Rights in Africa Report to a wider audience and we are committed to more of such interventions in the future.”
