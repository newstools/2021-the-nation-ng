An official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) has been killed by a motorist in Mile 12, Lagos. LASTMA General Manager Olajide Oduyoye said the deceased, Samson Olawale Akinmade, who was knocked down on Tuesday, died in the early hours of Wednesday. Giving details of the incident, Oduyoye said the driver of a blue-black Opel Space Bus marked AAA 74 GG knocked down Akinmade at Demurin Street Junction, Mile 12 while controlling traffic, leaving him with head and body injuries. The official was immediately rushed to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), where he eventually died around due to severe injury sustained. He said: “This event is particularly sad because this was a young, intelligent and dedicated officer employed in the year 2019, was very committed to his job but has been cut down in his prime by a careless and lawless driver, thereby depriving his family, the government agency, Lagos and Nigeria of a future leader in the making.” Oduyoye said the event occurred while the deceased was directing yellow buses away from the Demurin Street Junction and approached the motorist not to pick passengers.
