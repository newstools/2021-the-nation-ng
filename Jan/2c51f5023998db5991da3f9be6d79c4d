    Football fans on  DStv and GOtv can look forward to loads of action from the 2020-21 Premier League and Serie A seasons, with matches scheduled for 15-18 January. The pick of matches from the Premier League this coming weekend sees Liverpool and Manchester United meet at Anfield. The match will be broadcast live at 5:30pm on SuperSport Premier League (channel 203) exclusive to DStv subscribers. This classic English rivalry is always fiercely contested, but it will have even more importance this season as United have emerged as potential title challengers to Jurgen Klopp’s men. The Red Devils are particularly good away from home with the pace and penetration of their counter attacks proving too much for host teams to handle, though producing a similar showing against the class of a team such as ‘Pool” will be no easy task. This round of Premier League action also features a Friday night London derby between an improving Fulham and a Chelsea side looking to recapture their prime form at 9pm live on SuperSport Premier League; a Saturday-evening battle between two European hopefuls in Aston Villa and Everton at 6:30pm live on SuperSport Grandstand (DStv Channel 201) and SuperSport Premier League (DStv Channel 203). Sunday and Monday will also feature Tottenham Hotspur visiting Sheffield United at 3:00pm on SS Premier League, Manchester City hosting Crystal Palace at 8:15pm live on SuperSport Grandstand, SuperSport Premier League and SuperSport GOtv Football (GOtv Channel 31) while Arsenal will welcome Newcastle United to the Emirates Stadium on Monday at 9pm live on SuperSport Premier League. There are two standout matches from this weekend’s Serie A action, starting with a Friday night clash between Lazio and Roma. The match will air live at 8:45pm on SuperSport Football (DStv channel 205 and GOtv channel 31) and SuperSport GOtv Select 1 (GOtv channel 33). The ‘Derby della Capitale’ or Rome derby is one of the most fervent rivalries in all of Italian football. It has been almost a full year since their last Serie A meeting and fans of both the Giallorossi and Le Aquile will be itching to watch this battle. The other key clash of the round takes place on Sunday night and sees Internazionale host Juventus at San Siro for a game which could be key in the race for the Scudetto. Tune in at 8:45pm on SuperSport Football and SuperSport GOtv Select 1. The round of games in Italy also features Napoli hosting Fiorentina, Atalanta welcoming Genoa to Bergamo, and a closing clash which sees Milan visit the Sardegna Arena on Monday night for a battle with Cagliari.
