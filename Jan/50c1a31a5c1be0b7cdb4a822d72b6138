 Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe has warned new students of the Distance Learning Institute to avoid misconduct and social vices. He noted that the institution would not tolerate such. He spoke at the matriculation of the Distance Learning Institute, on Thursday last week. “We shall not condone any act of indiscipline, misconduct, violence and other vices. “Out of many thousands who have applied to study here, only a few of you were eventually selected. “I, therefore, urge you all to align yourselves to the vision of this university by being focused, disciplined as well as uphold the academic and moral standard of this institution,” he said. Ogundipe noted that COVID-19 had severely affected academic activities on campus, but expressed delight that with virtual learning, things were gradually taking shape. Director of the institute, Prof. Uchenna Udeani, said the university was committed to quality service delivery by being prompt, transparent and accountable in all its affairs. Udeani said the institute had put in place various resources that would enhance their studies. “There are also various academic support programmes that are available for you to excel in your studies. “After the online orientation programme, familiarise yourselves with the Learning Management System (LMS) and what the assessment policy of the institute says. “All of these are available online,” she said. She said this year’s matriculation witnessed changes as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. “We have a few adjustments this year, firstly by ensuring that only 100 out of the 3,500 new students were allowed physically into the hall. Others joined virtually, through our Facebook and YouTube channels,” she said.
