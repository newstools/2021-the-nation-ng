 A FEDERAL High Court in Lagos has nullified a four-year ban imposed on an American 1968 double Olympic champion, Dr Lee Edward Evans, by the Athletes Federation of Nigeria (AFN) in 2014. Justice Ayokunle Faji held that the suspension – imposed while Evans was working as an athletics consultant for the Lagos State Government – was unlawful and inconsistent with natural justice. The judge set aside the report of the AFN’s anti-doping committee fair hearing panel which sat on February 17, 2014, for being speculative, devoid of fair hearing and having been arrived at in a manner unknown to law. Justice Faji also awarded N46,430,000.00 in favour of the former Olympian, being the total money and special damages, which he ought to have earned within the four years that his appointment was unlawfully suspended. The judge also restrained the AFN from further preventing the 73-year-old from practicing his trade or profession in Nigeria. Evans, the first human to run 400m under 45 seconds and whose world track records at the Mexico ‘68 Games stood for 20 years, was punished alongside youth coach Abass Rauf who got a life ban.
