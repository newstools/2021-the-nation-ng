The Nigeria Civil Service Union (NCSU) has called on the President of the National Industrial Court, Justice B.B. Kanyip to review the appointment of a Public Trustee to oversee the affairs of the union. The union’s appeal is based on a judgement of the court in a suit No. NICN/ABJ/31/2016 which appointed Mr. Monday Ubani, as a Public Trustee following the nullification of its January 2018 National Delegates Conference in which the Comrade Lawrence Amaechi-led executive was elected. The Public Trustee was expected to run the affairs of the union and organise an election within three months. But briefing labour correspondents on the development, the Chairman of the Kano Council of NCSU, Comrade Kabiru Inuwa, on Monday said the union had appealed the ruling at the Federal Appeal Court, on appeal No. CA/A/089/2019. “We sincerely feel it is not within judicial proceeding to appoint a trustee to the union when the appeal process is still pending at the Appeal Court. “We are appealing to the president of the National Industrial Court to critically look at the facts of the matter and review this appointment in the interest of justice.”
