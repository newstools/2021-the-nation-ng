Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard, is reported to be on his way out of the club after a spate of bad runs. Lampard, a legend of the club, started the season well but lost so many games that reportedly upset the owner Roman Abramovic. Despite spending £222m on transfers, he hasn’t been able to transform the fortunes of the club, which sits in ninth position on the EPL league. Former Borussia Dortmund and PSG Manager, Thomas Tuchel is reported to have accepted to replace Lampard. The announcement of Lampard’s sack, which has been widely repoted, is expected to be made later on Monday afternoon.
