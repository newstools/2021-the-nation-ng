Kano Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has charged the Federal Government to make laws banning nomadic cattle breeding across the nation. He spoke at the weekend in Daura, Katsina during a chat with journalists. He said the farmers/cattle herders conflicts would not end until a law banning movement of cows from the north to the Middle Belt and the southern parts. According to him, the challenge of cattle rustling, just like that of the farmers/herders constant conflicts, would be greatly addressed when such a law comes into effect. The Governor said Kano had been able to largely curtail banditry and related criminal activities because his administration had built a cattle rearing colony, also known as RUGA. “We are building a Ruga settlement in Samsosua Forest, our border with Katsina and we have succeeded in curtailing the effect of banditry in that area. “So, we are building many houses, we are constructing a dam; we are establishing a cattle artificial insemination centre; we are establishing veterinary clinic and already we have started building houses for herdsmen. “My advocacy is that we should abolish the transportation or trekking of herdsmen from the northern part of Nigeria to the Middle Belt and to the Southern part of Nigeria. “There should be a law that will ban, otherwise we cannot control the conflicts between herdsmen and farmers and cannot control the cattle rustling, which is affecting us greatly,” he said.
