Pep Guardiola admitted he understood Dean Smith’s and Aston Villa’s frustrations following Bernardo Silva’s opener, but said: “We were outstanding and we deserved to win.” Villa were left raging at Jonathan Moss for allowing play to continue after Rodri pickpocketed Tyrone Mings in possession after the Spaniard came back from an offside position. Moss and the Premier League’s VAR officials were happy that the next phase of play had started after Mings brought down the ball following Bernardo’s header in the middle of the park – only for Rodri to run back and put Mings under pressure. Smith, meanwhile, was left fuming given City benefited from Rodri standing in an offside position and the Villa head coach was sent off for his reaction. As for Guardiola, the City chief was asked about the controversial decision. He said: “I didn’t watch the image on TV. I know they complained on the touchline and VAR is there. “There are many long balls, the player is offside and you go backwards, the central defender, you clear the ball and go for the second ball and then you use it to counter attack. “I don’t know exactly what is the rule but VAR is there. If it was offside as it showed then it would have been disallowed but, honestly, I didn’t watch it and I understand their reaction. In general, the way we played we were outstanding and we deserved to win.” Smith, though, blasted the decision. He said: “He’s taken advantage of an offside possession. He’s 10 yards offside, comes back and tackles Tyrone Mings from behind. What’s Tyrone meant to do? Let it go through or stand 10 yards off all of the time in the next few games now? “I don’t understand. At least go over to the screen. It looked a clear offside. When I realised they weren’t even looking at the screen and VAR didn’t mention anything I just told the fourth official that they had juggling balls for Christmas.”
