Chelsea have experienced managerial candidates under consideration as pressure increases on Frank Lampard after bowing to Leicester City. According to The Athletic, Chelsea are looking at experienced options to replace Frank Lampard as manager after a poor run of form in the Premier League. The defeat at the hands of Leicester on Tuesday night was the fifth loss in eight league matches for the Blues. Several managers have been linked with Chelsea with Lampard now staring at the axe at Stamford Bridge as Roman Abramovich contemplating the club’s next move. It remains to be seen whether Lampard will make it through to the next match, which is in the FA Cup against Luton Town this Sunday. Thomas Tuchel, recently sacked from Paris Saint-Germain, is the bookies’ favourite to take over. But Massimiliano Allegri has also been linked with the Italian keen on taking a job in the Premier League after learning English over the past two years.
