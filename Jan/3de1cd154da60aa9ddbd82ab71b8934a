The Venue for outstanding CAF Confederation Cup between high flying Rivers United and South African side Bloemfontein Celtic has now been confirmed. The match which is number 79 in the series will hold at the Stade Charles De Gaulles De Porto Novo, Benin Republic on 23rd January, 2021 at 16.00hrs. Media officer of the Garden City side Mayuku Charles dished out the information on Wednesday even as the new date will be 23rd of January as against 24th earlier reported. Confederation of African Football had mandated Rivers United as hosts to enter in discussion with a neighboring country to fix the venue and time for the clash. Wednesdayâ€™s confirmation is an indication that the Nigerian side who won the first leg 2-0 are working hard to meet the conditions issued by CAF on one hand and also in a hurry to finish the job they have started on the other. The Garden City Boys, considering their recent form look good to emerge from the encounter and will thereafter face compatriots Enyimba in the Confederation Cup playoffs. The tie originally billed for January 6 it will be recalled was put in limbo after Nigerian authorities declined to approve the tie citing the ravaging effecting of returnee Covid-19 second phase. Rivers United who have been in good form recently have earned three wins in three matches in the Nigeria professional league this season and take on Wikki Tourist in their next match later today in Bauchi. The team had earlier informed their teeming fans on pre-training ahead the match which some say will not be devoid of fireworks in view of the fight to the finish approach of both teams.
