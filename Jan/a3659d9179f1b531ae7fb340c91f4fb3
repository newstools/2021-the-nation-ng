 Manchester United rallied past Fulham to go back on top of the Premier League standings with a 2-1 win on Wednesday. The win at Craven Cottage gives United a two-point lead over Leicester City and Manchester City, and six points over Liverpool, who play on Thursday. Fulham caught the visitors off-guard when Ademola Lookman nabbed an early lead for Fulham after latching onto Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa’s throughball.  But United equalised in the 21st minute when Edinson Cavani pounced on the ball parried by Fulham keeper Alphonse Areola after he couldn’t hold onto Bruno Fernandes’ attempt. Paul Pogba gave United the match winner in the 65th minute when he curled in a strike into the top corner.
