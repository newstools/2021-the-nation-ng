The Coordinator, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Anambra State, Mr Kehinde Aremu on Saturday said it was possible to continue normal lives despite the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world. Aremu stated this at the state Orientation Camp during a pilot meeting of the COVID-19 Prevention & Compliance committee with the newly inaugurated COVID-19/ Sanitation Vanguards. He said such a feat was achievable if only Nigerians would abide by the safety protocols laid down by the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC). Aremu who is the Chairman of the COVID-19 Prevention & Compliance committee informed the team that they have been saddled with the responsibility of enlightening the camp community on the prevention as well as enforcing the compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols. While stating the likely challenges they could face in the course of their duties, Aremu reminded the committee of various media the virus could be contracted and how it could be prevented. He said, “It’s possible to continue normal lives despite the prevalence of the virus all around the world if only we abide by the safety protocols laid down by the NCDC. “We must insist on wearing our face masks, sanitising of our hands frequently, cleaning of used surfaces and maintaining respectable social distance, keeping our environment tidy, among other things. The Coordinator further urged the committee to give all necessary support to the Vanguards to help them achieve the stated goals, including efficient sensitisation on the risks of the virus and best strategy towards vigilance.
