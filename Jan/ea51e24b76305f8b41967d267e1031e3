 RETIREES under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) have appealed to the Federal Government to release more funds that can pay the backlog of their accrued rights. The Contributory Pensioners Union of Nigeria made the appeal in a communique made available to reporters by the President, Comrade Mathew Shittu, and Secretary, Elijah Akingbade Shittu, who lauded the National Pension Commission (PenCom), urged the commission to engage the Federal Government to pay the arrears. He frowned at the Federal and state governmentâ€™s intension to borrow from the CPS fund at the expense of their members who were yet to get their retirement benefits. He said it was unfortunate that states that have not joined the pension scheme want to reap where they have not sown. Meanwhile, the Federal Government last week released N11.818 billion for paying accrued rights. The Director-General, PenCom, Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar said the accrued rights represent benefits for employees of Treasury Funded Ministries, Departments & Agencies (MDAs) who worked up to June 2004, when the Pension Reform Act was introduced. She said the commission appreciated the efforts of the Federal Government in ensuring that the accrued rights arrears were cleared.
