 THE Ohanaeze Ndigbo faction led by Chidi Ibeh said on Tuesday it is set to roll out scholarship programmes for orphans, who are indigent students to cushion the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. It also plans to distribute 7,000 face masks and other palliatives in the seven Igbo-speaking states. Ibeh, who stated these in a statement issued in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, noted that the faction would also offset bills of 700 students writing the West African Senior School Certificate (WASSCE) and the National Examinations Council (NECO) Senior School Certificate examinations in the seven states. He noted that they were partnering with a philanthropic organisation to achieve the group’s programmes. According to him, there will be distributions of face marks and other palliatives in major markets and public schools for the protection of kids and teachers from COVID-19 pandemic. Ibeh added that the distribution will begin from February 1.  He assured the people that the new Ohanaeze must meet the challenges of Ndigbo headlong and restore the confidence of Igbo people in Ohanaeze Ndigbo. Ibeh stressed that his members are aware that Igbo are losing faith in Ohanaeze Ndigbo based on its elitist nature. The statement said: “Drastic measures will be put in place for the resuscitation of Igbos faith in Ohanaeze Ndigbo, a lot of indigenous Igbo people in Benue, Kogi, Akwa Ibom and Edo will be identified and given necessary support.”
