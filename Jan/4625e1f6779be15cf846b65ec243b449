Former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Prof. Oyewusi Ibidapo-Obe, is dead. The Nation learnt he died of COVID-19 complications. Ibidapo-Obe’s death came as a shock to the academic community as friends and associates described it as regrettable. Former Executive Secretary, National Universities Commission (NUC) and a Distinguished Professor of the Lagos State University LASU, Prof. Peter Okebukola, said he was with the deceased at the 2020 convocation of the Crawford University, Igbesa last month and he was a picture of good health. “I am not able to come to terms with this news; because the two of us were together two weeks at the Crawford University convocation and he was bubbling with health,” he said. Vice-Chancellor of UNILAG, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, said Ibidapo-Obe retired from the University in 2019 as the longest-serving academic staff after over 40 years. He said the university would play a prominent role in Ibidapo-Obe’s burial. Ibidapo Obe would have turned 72 in July. Prof Ibidapo-Obe was President of the Nigeria Academy of Science.
