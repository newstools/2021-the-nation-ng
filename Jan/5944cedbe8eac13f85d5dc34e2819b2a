President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday expressed sadness on the death of a former Minister of Education under Gen. Sani Abacha’s government, Alhaji Dauda Birma. The former presidential aspirant under the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and Sarkin Gabas of Adamawa died early on Tuesday at his home in Yola, the Adamawa State capital. He was 80. The President described him as a decent politician. Reacting to Birma’s demise in a statement in Abuja by his spokesman Garba Shehu, President Buhari said: “I am deeply touched by the passing of Dauda Birma, one of the finest and most decent politicians of our time. “Birma was a disciplined and respectable politician who gave politics a good image through personal examples. “I must also state here that Dauda Birma was a committed party man that worked passionately and assiduously for the success of our party. “May Allah forgive his shortcomings, reward his good deeds with Paradise and grant his family the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.” The late Birma, who was also the Waziri Garkida, hailed from Garkida, a historical town in Gombi Local Government Area of Adamawa State. One of his friends, Suleiman Yerima, said he was with the deceased on Monday, hours before his death in the early hours of Tuesday. Birma’s son, Musa, said of his father in a Facebook post: “Innalillahi wa inna ilaihin rajiun (from Allah did we come and to Him shall we return), I lost a part of me that can never be replaced. May Allah (SWT) forgive your sins and grant you Janna (Paradise).” A nephew of the late minister, Sanusi Dawi, also expressed his condolences.
