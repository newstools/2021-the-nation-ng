 The management of the Nigeria Women’s Football League (NWFL) has announced the postponement of Week-5 fixtures citing the inability of all 14 clubs to meet the COVID-19 test requirements for players and team officials. The NWFL Media Officer, Dapo Sotuminu, said on Monday that the Secretariat had given effect to the NWFL directives. “The board of the Nigeria Women Football League headed by Aisha Falode, has declared the postponement of Week 5 matches in order to accommodate collation and validation of the COVID-19 test being conducted by the Premiership clubs,” Sotuminu said. In the statement the NWFL Chairperson, Falode said that the NWFL did not want to take risks with any of the clubs as regards the appropriate test. “Going by the fresh wave of increased COVID-19 infections due to the new variants of the deadly disease which have left more people dead in Nigeria than before. “We are currently verifying and validating results sent in by some of the 14 clubs not up to half of the clubs in the league. “We are also going to verify the authenticity of the test centres sent in by the clubs from the Federal Ministry of Health, and the relevant state’s Ministry of Health, going by the reports that some clubs are going to unapproved centres to conduct the test. “Tests from unapproved centres will be rejected after verification and the clubs involved suspended from the league,” she said. The NWFL management added that the postponement of the league by one week was due to the tasking process of collation and validation.
