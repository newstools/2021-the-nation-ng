 THE President of the Nigerian League of Veteran Journalists, (NILVEJ), Chief Oliver Okpala, has advocated for provision of life insurance policies for journalists covering the COVID-19 pandemic across the country. In his New Year message, Okpala stresses the need for the management of various media organisations to float such insurance policies for their staff in line with best global practices. He however, advises journalists to ensure that they comply with the COVID-19 protocols, especially as they are often exposed to hazards, being on the frontline of reporting the ravaging global pandemic. According to Okpala, journalists must discharge their duties without fear or favour in line with the time tested tenets of the profession. He said they must remain upright and forthright because their role in nation building has even become more apparent given the enormous challenges confronting the nation on different fronts. The former Senior Special Adviser to the Anambra State Governor on Media maintains that the society is looking up to the media to give a sense of direction on how critical issues such as the economy, security and health could be handled to put the country on the right footing.
