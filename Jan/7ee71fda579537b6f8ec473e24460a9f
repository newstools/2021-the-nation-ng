A Lesbian, Gay, Transgender and Bisexual (LGTB) rights activist, public speaker, screenwriter and filmmaker, Pamela Adie, has made fun of former presidential aide Doyin Okupe, whose son Bolu, recently revealed he is gay. Okupe, who served during the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan, was a strong advocate of Same Sex Marraige Prohibition Act(SSMPA), which was signed by the then President. The SSMPA imposes a 10-year prison sentence on anyone who registers, operates, or participates in gay clubs, societies, and organizations or supports the activities of such organizations. The bill states that anyone caught in any act of homosexuality will face a jail term of between 10 to 14 years. Okupe, who has since dissociated himself from Bolu’s sexual orientation, declared it a spiritual challenge. But Adie said nemesis had caught up with Okupe. She said it was ironical that the man who was against the LGBT community has his son as part of the very act he prohibited. She also expressed repulsion at the fact he decided to go religious about what she should be considered to be normal. She tweeted: “Son: Dad, I’m gay “Dad: I’m a Christian. This is a spiritual attack! Let’s pray! “Una no dey tire? Na so scam pastors go dey chop una money upandan. “Don’t love and accept your children. Be looking for solution where there’s no problem. “With all his experience and exposure as a medical doctor, Doyin Okupe still believes that his son being gay is a “spiritual attack”. Where does one go from here?”
