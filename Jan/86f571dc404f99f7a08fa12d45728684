Two passengers have been killed and many others missing following an attack on two commercial boats around Dema Abbey Community on Bonny waterways. It was gathered that divers were still searching for the missing victims of the attack that occurred on Tuesday. The pirates were said to have compelled the passengers to jump into the water after seizing the two boats. The two, who were reported dead were said to have drowned while others struggled to swim to the nearby bushes and mangroves. Confirming the incident, the Chairman of Bonny Local Government Area, David Irimagha, said security agencies were later mobilized to respond to distress calls from victims of the attacks. He said the security operatives were pursuing the perpetrators to apprehend them and bring them to justice. Irimagha said: “From the very first call we mobilized the security agencies who equally responded speedily, unfortunately, the timing of the incident became a worrisome challenge.” “Nevertheless security operatives were there to secure the rescued persons and also search for others still inside the water while also chasing the criminals. They later moved the rescued persons to Polokiri Aru-Gbanama, from where they later escorted them to Bonny.” He said the rescue operation was still ongoing while the two corpses were recovered and brought back to Bonny. The council boss commiserated with the bereaved families over the loss of their loved ones, describing their deaths as “unfortunate and premature.” He assured that his administration was doing everything possible to find persons still missing after the attack.
