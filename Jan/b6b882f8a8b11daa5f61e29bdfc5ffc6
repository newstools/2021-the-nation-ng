Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) said Wednesday that it has ramped up efforts to stem the spread of the second wave of COVID-19 strain by ensuring proper screening of persons coming into the country through various control borders. Besides ensuring adherence to COVID â€“ 19 protocols for persons coming into the country, the service has equipped its personnel with personal protective equipment, sanitizers, face masks and shields and other materials to protect its workforce from any form of infection. Assistant Comptroller General (ACG) in charge of Lagos Zonal Office, Doris Braimah who disclosed this in Lagos at the first quarterly meeting for Comptrollers in the zone said the service will continue to sensitize Nigerians on the need to comply with prescribed COVID -19 protocols. She said since the outset of the pandemic the NIS has not relented in equipping its personnel with the right working tools, which he said has resulted in the minimal rate of mortality of its personnel. Braimah said the NIS will continue to abide by the directives issued by the Comptroller General of Immigration (CGI) Muhammad Babandede, on steps needed to scale up preventive measures for immigration personnel, who as frontline officers at various border control posts interface with different persons coming into and out of the country. She further disclosed that additional steps will be taken to beef up measures at the borders as Nigeria is set to open more border points across the country.
