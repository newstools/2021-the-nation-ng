Mesut Ozil has reportedly completed his move to Fenerbahce according to a social media post from a company the player co-owns. One Unity’s Twitter account posted: “We at @OneUnity are proud to announce that Mesut Özil will be moving to @Fenerbahce_EN . More to come.” The 32-year-old German international had been frozen out of Arsenal’s first team squad for the best part of a year under Mikel Arteta, as the club attempted to force him out. Ozil was one of several players who refused to take a pay cut during the coronavirus pandemic, and with his wages of £350,000 a week the London club were keen to get him off their wage books. He had been linked with a move to MLS side DC United but it appears now that he will move to Turkey, a country that he has a strong personal relationship with, having previously posed with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a photo.
