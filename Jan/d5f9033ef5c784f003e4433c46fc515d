 The defeat suffered by TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell against TSV Bad Königshofen in the Week 15 of the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL) may have taken its toll on Quadri Aruna rating as the Nigerian dropped to 16 from top 10 in the players’ rating. Unbeaten since the start of 2021, Aruna suffered defeat in TTC Fulda’s 3-1 home loss to the visiting TSV Bad Königshofen and surprisingly lost 3-0 to German international Kilian Ort in his first individual game on Tuesday A disappointed Aruna told NationSport on Thursday that he was yet to get over the unexpected loss, which he described as unfortunate. He said:  “I think I played very well in the two matches and it was clear for everybody that I was in top form but I cannot just explain what happened to me to have lost the two matches. “I knew it was not going to be an easy match but I was not expecting that I would lose the two matches because I trained well before the encounter. But I take solace in the fact that the team is not going to give up at this time as we are still hoping to move up the league table,” Aruna added. TTC Fulda is 10th  in the 12-team table with five wins and 10 losses while their next league match at home is against league leader Borussia Dusseldorf on Sunday.
