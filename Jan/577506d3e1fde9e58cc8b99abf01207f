 Institute of Education (IoE), Kwara State University, in conjunction with the Institute of Distance and e-Learning, has organised  training for academic staff of the institution on the principles of  writing  computer based tests (CBT). The session, which had about 50 teaching staff, was also transmitted virtually via Zoom for staff members, who could not be physically present due to the COVID-19 pandemic protocols restricting large gatherings. Director of the institute, Dr Ibrahim Laro Abubakar, said the training became imperative as the university was  planning to take most of its academic activities online in future. Dean, Post-Graduate School, KWASU Prof. Hamza AbdulRaheem noted that the university would soon begin computer-based tests for courses with large population of students. He  explained that since CBT is mostly objective questions, the training session was important to familiarise the teaching staff with the process of test development and item writing. The dean further emphasised that multiple choice questions can be used to “elicit high intellectual responses from the students” especially if the tests were designed to cover the six cognitive levels of knowledge. He urged academic staff of the institution to improve on their test development skills as it is crucial in the construction of credible objective questions. Dr Idris Muhammad Jamiu, a Test and Measurement expert from the UNILORIN, stressed the need for continuous evaluation in ensuring effective teaching and learning. He reiterated the importance of good test development skills  and guiding principles of test construction. Dr Isiaka Mope AbdulRafiu of the Institute of Distance and e-Learning, KWASU, assured the staff members that the CBT would be conducted on secured platforms which will limit examination malpractice. While giving a demonstration of how exam questions can be uploaded, he said the examinations will be invigilated from a control room by invigilators.
