 FILMMAKER, Niyi Akinmolayan has returned to Nigeria to start creating awareness for his new flick, ‘Prophetess’. The new film, which features Toyin Abraham as the lead character, is Akinmolayan’s return after ‘The Set Up’ which was released in 2019. The filmmaker, who is working with Toyin Abraham for the second time after the production of ‘The Elevator Baby,’ noted that the film was inspired after a screening session in Abeokuta. Narrating the experience, Akinmolayan said, “During the Elevator Baby screening at Abeokuta last year, I saw hundreds of people pushing on each other just to see Toyin Abraham. Some people traveled from Akure with their families. All they wanted was to touch her and take photos and tell her how much they loved her. The best part of the process for me was that I had to overcome ten years of laziness and fear to start writing back again! Luckily I finished the script just before d lockdown. It’s the most tedious thing I have ever done as a filmmaker.” The film also features Kunle Remmy, Deyemi Okanlawon, Adedimeji Lateef, Kehinde Bankole, Seyi Awolowo amongst many others.
