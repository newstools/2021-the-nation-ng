Akwa Ibom Government has given quit notice to hawkers and roadside traders to vacate the streets of Uyo, the state capital. Commissioner for Environment, Charles Udoh in a statement at the weekend, asked all roadside traders in Uyo and the Airport road to relocate to designated market areas before February 1, 2021. Udoh said at the expiration of the deadline, the ministry will launch ‘Operation Zero Tolerance to Street Trading and Illegal Markets.’ He said the decision was in line with the government’s commitment to promoting ”a cleaner, hygienic and aesthetically resplendent environment”. The Commissioner said the eradication of street trading in the UCC is a key component of the recently approved Environmental Beautification Policy for the Uyo Capital City. The statement reads; “The increasing wave of illegal activities of street traders, indiscriminate display of goods on road setbacks, walkways, and hawking on major roads; particularly around the Plaza Area, Wellington Bassey Road, Airport Road, Aka-Etinan Road junction and other highbrow areas in the metropolis has become a major cause for concern. ”These activities impede the free flow of traffic as well as expose traders and the general public to road hazards. ”Accordingly, all street traders, hawkers and operators of illegal markets around the plaza area, airport road, Aka – Etinan junction and other highbrow areas are advised to relocate to designated trading places on or before February 1, 2021, or be prepared to face the wrath of the law. ”This notice, therefore, serves as the last warning prelude to the enforcement of this order by the Enforcement Team of the Ministry of Environment.” He also said the current administration is committed to fast-tracking the vision of sustaining our state as an environmental friendly and the preferred destination for tourists and investors.
