A 15-year-old boy, Samuel Ogunwole, down with colorectal cancer, has pleaded with well-meaning Nigerians for financial assistance to complete his chemotherapy at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba. Samuel needs N500,000 to complete chemotherapy. Despite his health challenge, he wants to get back on his feet to pursue his career. “I have stopped going to school because of my ill health. I always feel pain. I cannot stay in the midst of people because of the foul smell that oozes from my stomach. I need help; I don’t want to die young,” Samuel said, holding back tears His mother, Olasunbo Atobatele, said they were asleep at night when he suddenly started breathing heavily, complaining of a sharp ache on the right side of his stomach. She said he did several tests and underwent surgery at a specialist hospital in May 2020, which gulped over N2m. A medical report signed by consultant radiation and clinical oncologist at LUTH, Dr Adegboyega B.C. and dated June 30, 2020, confirmed Ogunwole’s ailment.  Samuel is also expected to undergo two or three sessions of radiotherapy. Donations can be made to Bank Name: UBA; Account Name: Ogunwole Samuel; Account Number: 2172234115.
