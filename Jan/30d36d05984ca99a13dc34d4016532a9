One person was feared dead and many injured at the weekend following an explosion at a gas plant in Rumuodomaya, Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, Rivers State. The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) said its officials were at the scene and had begun investigation into the cause of the incident. It was learnt that three trucks inside the facility were burnt beyond recognition. Sources said over five persons suffered severe burns and were rushed to hospital. A resident said: “Musa is among them. We call him our papa. He is still in hospital. The people in the hospital said they don’t know if he will survive.” Another source complained that gas plants are clustered in a residential area. He said: “I don’t think all these companies are supposed to be close to residential areas. “Nobody came here. It was only the police that were trying to protect people and property and blocked the roads so that cars will not enter.” The incident which occurred about 8:45pm on Saturday threw residents into panic. An eyewitness said some workers were discharging gas at the station when the incident occurred. Zonal Controller of the Department of Petroleum Resources, Port Harcourt Zonal office, Bassey Nkanga confirmed the incident.
