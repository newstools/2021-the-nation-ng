Ekiti State Government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew between 8pm and 6am. It takes effect from Monday night. Information Commissioner Akin Omole, who made this known in a statement in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, announced ban on gatherings of more than 20 persons. He said the new guidelines were necessitated by the need to forestall further spread of COVID-19 pandemic, stressing that the dusk-to-dawn curfew would be enforced, except for people providing essential services. Omole reiterated government’s commitment to safety and well-being of the people, saying Governor Kayode Fayemi gave the guidelines to protect residents. He stressed the need for the people to observe COVID-19 protocols and comply with new restrictions placed on large gatherings, warning that defaulters would face the wrath of the law. Omole said residents should wear nose masks, wash hands with soap and use hand sanitiser regularly, adding that they should maintain social distance to avoid contracting the virus.
