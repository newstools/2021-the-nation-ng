 THE Chief Judge of Kogi State, Justice Henry Olusiyi retired from service on Monday, haven attained the mandatory retirement age of 65 years. In his valedictory speech at the High Court Complex in Lokoja, Olusiyi said serving as Chief Judge of Kogi State had afforded him the opportunity to make his contributions to the administration of justice within the six months he served in that capacity. “For me, the most important attributes of the judiciary and judges are independence, fearlessness and impeccable integrity. “In a country which professes to follow the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers, there is no alternative to a totally-independence judiciary. “All the three arms of government are expected to, and must, work together for achieving the goals set out in the Constitution. There must be harmony among the three arms. “The doctrine of separation of powers as enshrined in our Constitution is to ensure checks and balances among the three arms of government, to avoid the abuse of power and the risk of one arm wielding absolute power to the detriment of the other arms,” he said.
