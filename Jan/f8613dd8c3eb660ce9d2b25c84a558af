 Former Rangers FC star, Sylvanus Okpala, has hailed former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi for his immense contribution to sports in Nigeria particularly his support to ex-Rangers players.
Okpala, praised Obi for his nationalist spirit, saying the ex-governor cared for all former Rangers players, irrespective of their tribe. “He started paying ex-Rangers stipends every month. About a hundred of us or so; the number he could get. And he was paying not only to the Igbos who played for Rangers. Not only the Anambrarians who played for Rangers, everybody. You have some people who come from the South West, some people from the North that played for Rangers whose names are there are all beneficiaries of Obi’s largess, some from Delta, Rivers and people from everywhere. He has been of tremendous assistance to us, He provided us with an office in Enugu, gave us a brand new bus- that can take over twenty people”, Okpala said.  Okpala also recounted Obi’s moral support. “Obi gave us a lot of exposure and recognition. During his days as governor, he invited us to anything he was doing. On one occasion, we had to sleep over, when we couldn’t go back. He lodged us in a hotel. I think that was when he inaugurated Onitsha stadium. “I don’t think he was doing it for us alone. I believe he did the same for others too. He may not like what I am saying but I feel, for him to continue doing what he has been doing for us deserves commendation. His kindness is overwhelming. Even when any one of us loses a brother, sister or any relation or you are doing anything and he hears about it, he would appear. He is too kind to us,” Okpala added.
