Bandits have abducted not fewer than 50 people in an early morning attack on Bassa community in Shiroro local government area of Niger state. The Nation learnt the bandits stormed the community in large numbers in motorcycles in the early hours of Thursday. The people were getting set for the dayâ€™s activities, which were disrupted by the bandits, causing them to run into the bush for safety. The co-convener Concerned Shiroro Youths, Sani Abubakar Kokki confirmed the attack, describing the bandits as terrorists.
