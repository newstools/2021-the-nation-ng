 The rescheduled Confederation Cup tie between Rivers United and South Africaâ€™s Bloemfontein Celtic will be held on the weekend of 22-24 January. The game, which was originally slated for January 6, would reportedly be played in a country close to Nigeria which has more lenient COVID-19 protocols for travellers arriving from South Africa. The second leg of the last 32 tie was to be played in Port Harcourt but the South African side were not able to travel to Nigeria due to the strict coronavirus regulations by the Nigerian Government. Because South Africa is regarded as one of the high risk countries for the coronavirus, Bloemfontein Celtic would have had to quarantine for seven days upon arrival to Nigeria. Rivers United lead the tie 2-0 after the first leg with the overall winners progressing to play Champions League losers Enyimba of Nigeria in the play-offs to qualify for the group stage of the Confederation Cup.
