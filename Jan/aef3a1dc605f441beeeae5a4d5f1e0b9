Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has constituted a handover strategic implementation committee to facilitate the off-boarding of current administration personnel as well as ease the on-boarding process of incoming personnel.

Members of the Committee are the Head of Service, Mr. ‘Dare Aragbaiye to serve as Chairman; Dr. Patrick Tolani, Ms Cecilia Akintomide, Mr. Ayo Sotinrin, Mr. Omololu Elegbe and Mr. Babajide Akeredolu. Ojogo explained the committee is expected to recommend and advise the government on result-oriented structural processes and practices for existing MDAs, set Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for returning and new appointees and MDAs as well as develop a baseline for all sectors to serve as a benchmark for improvement. He said the committee would carry out systemic review of the operations of the administration in the last four years with a view to evaluating its performance and to identifying areas of service improvement. According to him: “The Committee is mandated to develop a new Agenda for the incoming administration focusing on performance-based income generation strategy as well as formulating SMART service delivery across Government departments and agencies of government. “The committee will commence work immediately and shall work until a proper handover structure is developed, adopted, and implemented. “The committee is expected to provide reports of its activities to Mr Governor frequently and submit a completion report at the instance of its dissolution.”
