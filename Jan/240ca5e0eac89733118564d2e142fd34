Unidentified gunmen reportedly abducted a man, after shooting him on Wednesday, in Warri, Delta state. The incident reportedly happened around 12pm by Omo-Agege Street in Edjeba community. Details surrounding the incident were still sketchy as of the time of filing this report, but local sources claimed he was trailed from a first-generation bank and robbed of an undisclosed sum of money. The victim was attacked in his Toyota Highlander. But the Police suspect it is a case of kidnapping because nobody was found on the scene. The Delta State Police spokesperson, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, said bloodstains were found on the seat of the SUV. “We don’t know if he is dead. The Police are still looking for him and those who attacked him. They only saw bloodstains in his vehicle. So maybe he was abducted. “They got the information. By the time they got there, they saw the highlander jeep parked with bloodstains. But nobody was inside,” she stated.
