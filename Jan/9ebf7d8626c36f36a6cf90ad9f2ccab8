It was gathered the remains of Senator Salami landed in Lagos airport around 8:30am and his body was brought to Osogbo where he was buried at Ansar U Deen Central Mosque Cemetery, Sabo, Osogbo. An ambulance took his body to his home at GRA and later left with sympathisers to the interment venue. No sermon was preached by any Islamic cleric at the cemetery where he was buried. A family source told our correspondent that one of the wishes of Senator Salami was to be buried in Nigeria, which was why it took ten days before his internment.
