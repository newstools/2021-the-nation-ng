 THE Vice Chancellor of the University of Calabar, Prof. Florence Obi, has canvassed the support of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), urging the agency to make its impact felt in the institution. Obi made the call in Calabar when officials of the agency paid her a visit earlier in the week. She said the university under her leadership intended to have a robust relationship with TETFUND and would want to see more of its impact in the institution. Obi said the university has had to grapple with many infrastructural challenges over the years which had resulted in many errors and shortcomings. The vice chancellor noted that with the visit of TETFUND officials, the university would be guided on the path of global best practices in the administration of the institution. Oye Abdul-Rasheed, who led the team, said they were in the institution to inspect past and ongoing projects financed by the agency. He said the exercise, which would cover projects executed from 2012 to date, would be devoid of witch-hunt but rather aimed at enhancing knowledgeable, effective and sound mode of TETFUND operations.
