 All efforts to get a bail for the Shepherd-in-Charge of Celestial Church of Christ Global Genesis Parish, Israel Oladele Ogundipe, aka Israel Genesis, have been abortive since he was jailed for defrauding a United Kingdom-based woman, Mrs. Olaide Williams-Oni. Ogundipe, who has been on trial since 2011, was sentenced to two years imprisonment by a Lagos State High Court after he was found guilty of the crime. But despite his present situation, church members have decided to celebrate his birthday on March 10. The invitation states that the event would be held in the church auditorium at Alakuko, Lagos. Considering his sentence, the popular Lagos-based prophet will be celebrating his birthday in prison this year. This will be usual for his friends, loved ones and followers as Ogundipe always celebrates his birthday in a special way. Born March 10, 1974, Ogundipe is seen by many as a selfless giver and great philanthropist, and he has been a prophet for more than 15 years.
