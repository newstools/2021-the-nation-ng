IRAN on Friday slammed its doors against the importation of COVID-19 vaccines from the United States and Britain. The country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the Western powers “untrustworthy”. In a live televised speech, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei insinuated, during a televised speech, that Washington and London, could possibly be seeking to spread the infection to other countries. Iran is the hardest hit country by the Coronavirus in the Middle East But he said Teheran could obtain vaccines from ‘other reliable places’ which are believed to be China and Russia, both of which are allies of Iran. He said: “Imports of U.S. and British vaccines into the country are forbidden … They’re completely untrustworthy. “It’s not unlikely they would want to contaminate other nations. “Given our experience with France’s HIV-tainted blood supplies, French vaccines aren’t trustworthy either.” He was referring to the country’s contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s. Iran launched human trials of its first domestic COVID-19 vaccine candidate late last month, saying it could help Iran defeat the pandemic despite U.S. sanctions that affect its ability to import vaccines.
