 Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has admitted that he’s spoilt for choice with forwards, even as he described Victor Osimhen’s return to action for Napoli in the Italian Serie A as a good omen ahead of the forthcoming 2021 AFCON qualifiers in March. Osimhen, Africa’s costliest player ever, has been out injured since November following a dislocated arm in the AFCON home tie against Leone Star of Sierra Leone in Benin. He made a 25-minute cameo on Sunday as Napoli were beaten 3-1 away against Verona. But Rohr is upbeat about Osimhen’s return after days of injury cum COVID-19 interregnum. “We are happy about the comeback of Victor which is his first game after the injury in Benin City,” the 67-year-old former Bordeaux coach told NationSport.  Pressed about strikers who would likely make his list for the MatchDay 5 and 6 fixtures against Benin on March 22 and Lesotho on March 30 respectively, Rohr said there would be ‘good competition in that position.’ Many Nigeria international strikers according to Rohr are doing well with their respective European clubs consequently there would be fierce battle for shirts. “ We have other strikers (doing very well with their clubs),” Rohr said. “Yes, Paul Onuachu (Genk, Belgium), Simy Nwankwo (Crotone, Italy), Taiwo Awoniyi (Union Berlin, Germany), Umar Sadiq (Almeria, Spain) and Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester City, England); so there is à good competition on that position and we are scouting all of them.” Incidentally, Osimhen with four goals is the leading scorer on the continent in the qualifiers towards the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Cameroun.
