A Tammy Abraham hat-trick secured Chelsea’s victory over Luton Town in the FA Cup fourth round to relieve some pressure on manager Frank Lampard. Abraham slotted in from Timo Werner’s cut-back before nodding in a second from Reece James’ chip. Jordan Clark scored for the visitors – after an error by keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga- on 30 minutes to keep them in the game. But Abraham poked home to seal victory before Timo Werner missed a penalty. Chelsea will face Championship side Barnsley in the fifth round.
