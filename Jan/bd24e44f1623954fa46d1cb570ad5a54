One of Davido’s aides, Afeare Isreal, revealed why popular singer, Zlatan Ibile, blocked DJ Cuppy on social media. Zlatan, he said, blocked the daughter of billionaire Femi Otedola because she failed to compensate him for the success of her hit song Gelato, in 2019. Isreal’s claims spoke barely 24 hours after Zlatan denied knowing DJ Cuppy in a viral video during an interview on The Switch show. The personal logistics manager of Davido, who described DJ Cuppy as a “fake friend” said she also failed to compensate Zlatan for making billions in fund-raising event he facilitated in Abuja. Writing on his Instagram handle, he said “Kudos to someone like Zlatan, who took a bold step by flushing a full fake friend like Cuppy who was just using his head all in the name of my papa na Otedola. Zlatan did a hit collabo with her, ordinary one kobo, he no see. “She also took Zlatan to Abuja for her fundraising where she made billions of naira and didn’t even remember Zee for one kobo until tomorrow. No accommodation, no feeding. “Zlatan had to even spend his own personal money at Transcorp Hilton to carter for everyone including me. Dis na 2021 abeg.” Cuppy had complained months ago that Zlatan blocked her on social media, wondering what went wrong. She tweeted: “10 months later and I sometimes still wonder why Zlatan Ibile blocked me on WhatsApp and Instagram without ever saying why; we were actually friends and “Gelato” was a hit!”
