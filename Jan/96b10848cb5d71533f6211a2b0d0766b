 WEMA Bank Plc has shortlisted 10 finalists to take part in the Virtual Bootcamp for its Hackaholics (2.0) Accelerator Programme which started on January 18. The finalists, pooled from over 500 applications, were unveiled during the two-day virtual pitch programme last year. Wema Bank Managing Director,  Ademola Adebise commended the startups for their efforts to contribute to the growth of the society. He said: “We are very proud to create a platform where businesses can have access to diverse resources that can enable them to provide solutions to prevailing everyday challenges. “This is borne out of our aspiration to create innovative solutions that can help us as a bank, our environment and the country at large. ‘’In its second year, we are very excited to have started an initiative focused on creating commercialisation opportunities for participating businesses by leveraging top-notch resources needed to give their solutions a competitive edge in the market.” The first day of the pitch was an avenue for startups to prepare and get to know more about Hackaholics 2.0, the evaluation criteria, an overview of each identified industry, market demands and needs, the importance of tech in these areas, and a session for questions and answers.
