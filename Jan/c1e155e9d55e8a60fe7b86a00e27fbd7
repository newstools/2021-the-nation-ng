Amobi Ezeaku, Team Manager, Rangers International FC of Enugu, has hailed the League Management Company (LMC) for airing matches live to spectators in the country. Ezeaku said yesterday in Enugu that the league had really improved in many ways in spite of being only two weeks old since it resumed. He also applauded the LMC for a better organisation of the on-going Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season in the country.  ”With the foundation on the ground, the new season will be better than the previous ones as the league had started with the matches being aired on NPFL television, NTA and others. ”We have also seen improvements in the area of officiating, as most of the match centres have FIFA-licensed referees. Even the games played so far, showed that most clubs are prepared and their talents abound in the new season”, Ezeaku said.
