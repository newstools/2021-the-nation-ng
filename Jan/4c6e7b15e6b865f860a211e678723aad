 Following Winfred Ndidi’s brilliant strike for Leicester City against Chelsea on Tuesday night, Ndidi’s former coach Manu Garba at the national youth team setup , has likened his former  ward to German legend Franz Beckenbauer. The hard-tackling midfielder helped fire the Foxes to the summit of the English Premier League following Tuesday’s 2-0 win over Chelsea on Tuesday night. First half goals from Ndidi, his first since September 2019, and James Maddison lifted  Leicester a point above Manchester United.
Garba mentored Ndidi at the Nigeria national Under-17 football team in 2013 and the pair won the 2015 African U-20 Championship in Senegal.
Commenting on the well-struck  goal against Chelsea, Garba believes it  would spur Ndidi  to perform better. “It was a well-taken first time shot that the goalkeeper didn’t expect from outside the box and will go a long way to give him more confidence,” Garba  told NationSport .”I remember his days in the U17 and U20 as a center back. He always wanted to join the attack typical of Franz Beckenbauer of Germany”.  Meanwhile, Ndidi believes that Leicester City will not get carried away and take their current form in the EPL for granted.
“We know what we want to achieve, but it comes game after game. We try to focus on the next game,” Ndidi told the club’s official site.
“I’m very happy. In these games, we wanted to try as much as possible to get these points. I feel very good. I would say there are still more games to come.
“As a team, we want the points. We want to play and get the points. So, I just feel it’s one of these games that we really did good in but there’s still more to learn and hopefully better games coming our way.
“It’s very exciting and we feel very happy because it’s part of the season and there’s more games to come.
“At this time, we just build confidence for the next game, we don’t think about the end of the season.”
