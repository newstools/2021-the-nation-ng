Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Enforcement Unit has impounded over 100 commercial motorcycles as part of efforts to ensure sanity on the state roads. Chairman of the task force, CSP Shola Jejeloye, said this on Sunday in a statement signed by the agency’s Head, Public Affairs Unit, Mr Taofiq Adebayo. Jejeloye said that the discouraging high statistics of motorcycle accidents and the compelling need to enhance safety on the roads led to the promulgation of the Lagos State Transport Sector Reformed Law 2018. “We impounded these 100 notorious illegal commercial motorcycles around Navy Town, Alakija, 2nd Rainbow and Festac Town. “The enforcement operation is carried out to halt the abuse of traffic laws by motorcycle operators,” he said. Jejeloye also said the influx of illegal motorcyclists into the state without any traceable address or valid means of identification, remained a huge security and safety threat to residents. “In accordance with the law, every motorcycle operator must wear crash helmets; be above 18 years, not ride on the kerb, median, road-setbacks and avoid restricted routes. “Furthermore, every motorcycle must not carry more than one passenger, pregnant woman or adult with baby or child below 12 years and must not install any musical gadgets.”
