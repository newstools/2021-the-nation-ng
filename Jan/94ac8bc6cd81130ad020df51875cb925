 THE Senator Magnus Abe-led faction and the Rotimi Amaechi groups of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State  have disagreed on the party’s participation in the local government election. The Isaac Ogbobula-led faction loyal to Amaechi had ruled out the party’s participation and rolled out a strategy to stop the election through a court process. But the Golden Ben-Chioma faction, loyal to Abe, yesterday asked party members willing to contest to pick their chairmanship and councillorship forms. Ben-Chioma said forms for the 319 wards and 23 local government areas were ready in line with the guidelines announced by the State Independent Electoral Commission. He called on all party members to be actively involved in the poll by participating in all activities ahead of the election. Ben-Chioma said: “APC Rivers State has come to stay, but must move away from our inglorious past when we did not plan adequately for elections due to the actions of one man. “This time, we shall participate and strive to win seats in the wards and local government councils.” Abe, in a statement by his media aide, Parry Benson, called on Rivers people to come out en masse and participate in the elections.
