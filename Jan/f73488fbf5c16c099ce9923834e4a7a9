The maiden Ijesha Grand Marathon billed for April 3, 2021 has received the nod of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN). The event which will attract attention to Ijeshaland and put the sprawling town on sporting limelight is sponsored by BELTIJ Limited. A member of the board of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Dare Esan who led other notable officials from the athletics governing body that included top Athletics Coach, Tony Osheku to the unveiling ceremony held in Ilesha pledged to give the road race all necessary support needed to earn recognition of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) like other well organized road races in Nigeria such as Okpekpe International 10km Road Race and Lagos Marathon. Tijani Remilekun Usman, CEO of BELTIJ said his company decided to sponsor the event in order to take the youths out of streets and redirect their focus from cyber crimes to good things sports can offer, and to engage the youths through sport for physical fitness and build professional athletes that will represent Nigeria in international athletics events. “Most of our youths nowadays occupy themselves with unproductive activities with youthful exuberances like illicit drugs-taking, cultism violence practices, juvenile delinquency and other social vices. I believe they can be positively engaged in healthy sporting activities that can enhance their future. I decided to bring my company to Ilesa with the view to provide employment opportunities for the youths”, Tijani noted.
