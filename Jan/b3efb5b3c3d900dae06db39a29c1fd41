A 60-year-old traditional chief in Ibadan has been arrested for allegedly abusing two female minors. The suspect was said to have caused the two minors, who are siblings, to shave off their pubic hair, and also inserted his finger in their private parts. On learning of the suspectâ€™s alleged acts, a mob encircled his house yesterday, intent on burning it down with him inside. Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence (NSCDC) came to his rescue, and took him in for questioning The suspect, who was identified as Mogaji of Ori Aare compound, was accused of tricking the two girls, one aged 17, the other 13, into his house and made them shave their pubic hair. Afterwards, he allegedly packed the hair in a piece of paper, added alligator pepper and asked them to bury it around their house. He also allegedly warned the children against telling their parents or anybody about their encounter. But fearing that the Mogaji may have set them up for ritual, they reportedly requested their grandmother to take them to her spiritualist for cleansing. Bewildered by the request, the old woman was said to have probed them further and soon got the whole story. Spokesman of the corps Oluwole Olusegun, said the suspect claimed that the children came to him for spiritual assistance which he rendered.
