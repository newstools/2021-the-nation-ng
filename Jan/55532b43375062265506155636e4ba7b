The Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) said yesterday that about 20 of its members have in the last three weeks been infected with COVID-19. Its President, Dr. Badmus Habeeb, said members of the association are battling the pandemic “based on the available resources”. “About 20 of our members have become infected in the last two to three weeks. “I must reiterate that this is not the best of times for us, our families and the affected patients.” Habeeb, however, said the discovery of vaccine had brought hope and relief for everyone. He said there is a poor resource setting in the country, where basic necessities to make the roll out of the COVID-19 vaccines easy and possible are not readily available. “So, it, therefore, seems we may never be able to get the vaccine anytime soon,” he said.
