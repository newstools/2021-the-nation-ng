 A development driven group-African Growth has initiated plans to raise funds to address lingering challenges and myriad problems facing the continent. Using the window of African Growth Project, the organisation said it is sending out requests to Africans who can generate enough funds for the development of the continent. According to the group, such Africans willing to release funds could then recommend and execute projects under very transparent and circumspect regime. Explaining the modalities of operation, coordinator of the project, Gloria Poku Adusi stated that 75 per cent of the generated profits realized from such projects will be used exclusively for the development of Africa on a massive scale. Posu said to encourage Africans to take part in the process, 10 per cent of the profits realized from it would be retained by those who brought the projects while the remaining 15 per cent will be used for the expansion, management, and development to help bring the project that generated the profit to global standards, such that the projects will be able to generate the sort of funds that will help transform the continent. The coordinator emphasised that the strategic position of Nigeria in Africa has made the group  focus more on the country, so as to put them on the right track which will definitely rub off on other African countries. “This is why our priority is set on getting Nigeria on the right track and Nigeria’s success will make it that bit easier for other countries in the continent to become successful as well. Several people have handed in their projects for us to review and we have been able to spot one project with lots of potential. The project we are referring to is a platform known as ViaNile.Com. We would describe ViaNile as a platform with a blend of the features of Amazon and Facebook combined,” she noted.
