 THE Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Thursday explained that power generation and evacuation are dependent on what the 11 electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) request for. He said although the TCN can evacuate 8,100 Mega Watts, energy production is still limited to the load the distributors are ready to pay for. General Manager, Public Affairs, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Ndidi Mbah made this known in a press release at Abuja on Thursday. TCN added that “the fact is that electricity cannot be stored; therefore, power generation, transmission and distribution occur simultaneously. ” According to her, *what determines what is put on the grid, is what the distribution companies are ready to off-take, this equally regulates what the generator would generate, which is why the DisCos are required to nominate what they would off-take a day ahead.” The statement reads in part: “It is important to note that whatever happens on the donstream network, impacts on transmission and generators. The TCN grid network has the capacity of 8,100MW even as it continues to work towards completing ongoing projects to further increase its capacity.” The National Control Centre (NCC), an arm of TCN, according to her, is responsible for ensuring grid stability and its dispatch instructions are guided by the Grid Code, which it strictly adheres to, with clear understanding of consequences to the nation’s grid.
