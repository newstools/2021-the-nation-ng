 An   Associate Professor  in  the   Department  of Science Education,University of Ilorin (UNILORIN), Dr  Ganiyu Ismail Bello, has emphasised the need to create an enabling environment for the country to excel in research and development. He noted that research is crucial in driving innovation and discoveries which are aimed at enhancing the socio-economic and material wellbeing of the society.He added that the country cannot continue to depend on research findings from advanced nations because each country has its peculiar challenges. Bello said if Nigerian researchers had the right environment to operate, they can outshine their counterparts from other countries. “Research at our own level is very essential to improve the  material wellbeing of the society and make the world better. With  proper   priorities  given in terms of  facilities, welfare of both academic and non- academic staff, we can outclass the Western world. Many Nigerians in every sphere of human endeavour in the Diaspora have continued to excel,  which   proves  that  our internal environment is not good enough,” he said. He thanked the university for finding him worthy of elevation to the level of Associate Professor, noting that it will inspire him to be more dedicated to the institution and the nation at large. He advised those  who want to excel in academics to be more concerned about their contributions to their immediate environment and society.
