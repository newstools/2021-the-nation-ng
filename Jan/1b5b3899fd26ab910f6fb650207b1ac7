Music duo, Apex and Bionic aka AB, ended the year 2020 with the simultaneous release of a fresh album and movie. The JFK Resolute acts made history as the only African acts to put out two big projects simultaneously. The entertainers towed the path of American rapper Curtis Jackson a.k.a 50cent, who released an album and a movie at once. Apex and Bionic made history as the only artists to have successfully achieved such a feat at a young age. The album and the movie were titled ‘Nobody Holy’. The album and movie expose the social ills and how difficult it is for an average young African to be upright considering the everyday struggles. Garnering support from some of the best acts in the music space like 2face, Davido, OritsheFemi Seyi Shay, and Slim Case, Apex and Bionic were able to preach love, the need to embrace flaws, believe in hustles while focusing more on strengths successfully. The movie featured Nollywood bigwigs like Belinda Effah, Uche Ogbodo, Kelvin Ikeduba, Instagram sensation, Funny Toheeb, as well as Apex and Bionic.
