Chairman of the Oyo chapter of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders of Nigeria, Alhaji Ibrahim Jiji, has appealed to Governor Seyi Makinde to ensure the arrest of Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho. Igboho had ordered herdsmen to vacate Igangan in Ibarapa North Local Government over incessant kidnap and rape of women. But Makinde stated Igboho had no powers to give such orders, asking the Commissioner of Police to treat such acts as criminal. Jiji begged Makinde to consider Fulani people as his children, saying Yoruba people are doing well in other parts of the country and not being intimidated. According to him, many Fulani people in the North are now afraid to visit the southwest states for fear of being attacked. “We want government to arrest Igboho now. He is not more powerful than the whole country. We want Makinde to consider us as part of his children. We also voted for him in 2019 and we want him to extend his hand of fellowship to us. “Many of the affected people cannot recognise their family roots in the North again. In fact, many of them have not gone to their villages before. We are ready to work with Oyo State government to maintain peace and order,” he said.
