The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (DESOPADEC), Bashorun Askia Ogieh, has said that the future of Nigeria belongs to artisans, not youths seeking scarce white-collar jobs. Askia stated this Friday, in a New Year message titled ‘a New Year and Hope Renewed’, personally signed by him. He noted that commission will focus on entrepreneurship and building skills for youths from oil bearing communities across the state, disclosing that the DESOPADEC Skills Academy will kick start in the new year. Urging youths to take advantage of the Academy to secure their future, he noted that beneficiaries of these trainings would become employers of labour. Parts of the message read, “programmes designed to equip our people with requisite business acumen and entrepreneurial wherewithal to venture into businesses will be vigorously pursued by DESOPADEC in the New Year. “Our primary target for the programmes are our vibrant youth and our womenfolk. We are poised to kick start the DESOPADEC Skills Academy, believing that the future belongs to the artisans and not youths who parade certificates, looking for non-existent white collar jobs. “For the ready youths, DESOPADEC will make them employers of labour and confident and enterprising youths, through our Academy,” he said. He commended the people of the agency’s mandate areas for their continued peaceful and supportive disposition which has enabled development to thrive. “I must state, for emphasis, that the Commission has enjoyed the partnership and cooperation of our mandate areas, giving us the atmosphere to impact positively and to deliver our intended vision and mission. For that, we are most grateful and crave further mutual collaboration for the benefit of our people and communities,” Ogieh stated.
