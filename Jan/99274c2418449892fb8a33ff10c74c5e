 The Premier League has confirmed 36 positive coronavirus cases were recorded in the latest week of testing. It marks a slight drop from the season-high of 40 positive cases which were revealed in last week’s results – the first in which players and staff at all 20 clubs were being tested twice a week. “The Premier League can today [January 11] confirm that between Monday 4 January and Sunday 10 January, across two rounds of testing, 2,593 players and club staff were tested for COVID-19. Of these, there were 36 new positive tests,” read a Premier League statement. “Players or club staff who have tested positive will self-isolate for a period of 10 days. “The Premier League is providing this aggregated information for the purposes of competition integrity and transparency. No specific details as to clubs or individuals will be provided by the League and results will be made public on a weekly basis.” Five matches have been called off because of coronavirus cases this season after Tottenham’s scheduled trip to face Aston Villa was postponed yesterday  after an outbreak in the Villa squad. Newcastle’s game away at Aston Villa on December 4 was the first to be postponed due to multiple Covid-19 positives among Steve Bruce’s squad and backroom staff. Meanwhile,  Jose Mourinho’s men will now  face Fulham in a rearranged fixture to be played tomorrow.
