West Bromwich Albion manager, Sam Allardyce has revealed why heâ€™s showing interest in Super Eagles skipper Ahmed Musa. The former Leicester City striker is a free agent as he has left Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia. According to the Daily Mail, Baggies boss Sam Allardyce may turn to veteran Musa as he needs a cut-price forward to help his team score enough goals to avoid relegation. Musa is interested in the move, as he wants to show he has the quality to succeed in the Premier League, as he had a mediocre spell with Leicester. West Brom have reportedly applied for a visa for the 28-year-old, and he may even travel to the country on Wednesday.
