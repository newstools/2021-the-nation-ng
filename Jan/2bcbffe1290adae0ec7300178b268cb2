Sam Allardyce’s nightmare start to his reign as West Brom manager continued as his former club Blackpool knocked the Baggies out of the FA Cup on penalties. Twice the League One club led as Jerry Yates swept in Bez Lubala’s cross from close range and Gary Madine stroked into the bottom corner from 20 yards. Semi Ajayi’s header and Matheus Pereira’s penalty, awarded for an Ollie Turton handball, forced extra time. But Chris Maxwell saved three shootout spot-kicks to send Blackpool through. Maxwell, making his return after a bout of coronavirus forced him to miss Blackpool’s past two games, thwarted Kyle Edwards and Darnell Furlong before sealing the Seasiders’ progress by foiling Pereira.
