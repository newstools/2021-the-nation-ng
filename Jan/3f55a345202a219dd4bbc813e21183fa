 EX-LAWMAKERS of the Kwara State House of Assembly have urged Speaker Yakubu Danladi-Salihu to swear in Jimoh Raheem Agboola of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as ordered by the Supreme Court. The former lawmakers from 1979 to 2019 made the call in a communiqu√© at the end of their maiden meeting in Ilorin. It was signed by acting Chairman and Secretary Dr. Abraham Ashaolu and Isiaka Mogaji. The forum urged the 36 governors to respect and effect the Executive Order 10 issued by President Muhammadu Buhari to grant financial autonomy and independence to the Houses of Assembly. It lamented that while the legislature is the first arm of the government by arrangement, state legislatures have been relegated to the position of junior partners in their relationships with the governors and the executive arm of the government at the sub-national level.
