 FEDERAL Government has released N11.818 billion for payment of accrued rights to retirees, the Director-General, National Pension Commission (PenCom), Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar has said. Accrued rights represent benefits for employees of Treasury Funded Ministries, Departments & Agencies (MDAs) who worked up to June 2004, when the Pension Reform Act was introduced. She said the Commission appreciated the effort of the Federal Government at ensuring that the accrued rights arrears are cleared.
