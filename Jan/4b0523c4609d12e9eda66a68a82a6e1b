Real Madrid midfielder Martin Ødegaard has become frustrated with life at the Bernabeu. The 22-year-old has managed just 11 senior appearances for the club since he joined back in 2015. During his time in the Spanish capital, Ødergaard has enjoyed successful loan spells with Heerenveen and Vitesse in Eredivisie and, more recently, Real Sociedad in La Liga. Following the loan spells, the midfielder was expected to compete more regularly in Zinedine Zidane’s side, but that hasn’t been the case. As a result, the Norway international has asked for a move away. After he announced his desire to leave, Premier League side Arsenal showed immediate interest. The Gunners made an approach on Wednesday and the midfielder has appeared to favour a move to the Emirates over other potential destinations. If the move goes ahead, it could be a real coup for Mikel Arteta. The youngster will help release some of the pressure of emerging talent Emile Smith-Rowe and will be the creative midfielder the Gunners are so desperate to acquire. He would also play in midfield alongside fellow Real Madrid loanee, Dani Ceballos. As expected, Ødegaard attracted plenty of interest after declaring his desire to depart. Real Sociedad, who the 22-year-old spent last season on loan with, were keen for a return. The midfielder provided seven goals and nine assists from 36 appearances for the La Liga side last season.
