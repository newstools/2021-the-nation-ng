Fulham are feeling confident ahead of Saturday’s Premier League encounter against Chelsea, according to Ola Aina. Scott Parker’s men are on a five-game unbeaten run in the English top-flight and they are yet to taste defeat since their 2-0 loss to Manchester City on December 5. Saturday’s clash at Craven Cottage reunites Aina with his former club, where he spent over 11 years before he joined Torino permanently in June 2019, and he is hoping to prove a point against Chelsea. “I will always have fond memories of Chelsea, I came through their academy and managed to play a few games with the first-team,” Aina told the club website. “I enjoyed every minute of my time there and I have lifetime friends there too. London derbies are always something to relish. As for me, it will be a little bit spiced because I will be playing my old club with my old teammates. “I think they have been in fine form recently but we go into games to get the result.”
