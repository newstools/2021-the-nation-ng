A popular Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho has offered insights into his strained relationship with Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde. Igboho, last week attacked the Governor in a viral video over an arrest order him after he placed a quit notice to herders in Igangan, Ibarapa North Local Government area of the State. Speaking in an instagram live chat with popular journalist, Dele Momodu, on Tuesday afternoon, he said he and Makinde used to be very close. He recalled he assisted Makinde to win the 2019 governorship election though their relationship predated that exercise. According to him, the Governor commissioned his house in Soka area of Ibadan, which was razed in the early hours of Tuesday, in 2013. His words: “Governor Seyi Makinde and I have been together for a long time. He commissioned my house that was razed by hoodlums in 2013 and also provided a 500kva transformer for my street. “I supported him and campaigned for him during the 2019 governorship election in Oyo, I met him through former governor of Oyo State, Rasheed Ladoja. ‘’Rasheed Ladoja encouraged me to support Makinde during the election 2019 and I showed my utmost support because I never rejected any advice from Ladoja but Makinde never kept to his words due to the insecurity in the state and the incessant killings. So i took it upon myself to restore security by issuing the quit notice to the herders in the state.’’
