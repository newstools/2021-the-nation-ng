 Anthony Joshua would earn close to a $100 million to fight Tyson Fury, according to Fury’s promoter Bob Arum. The location for the fight, which is dubbed ‘The biggest fight in British boxing history’ has now been chosen although Arum declined to reveal the specific country at this stage. “The Joshua vs. Fury fight will earn each of the guys close to $100million,” Arum said. “It is the biggest fight in history in the UK, not even close. “Around the world it is the biggest fight that people want to see.” The coronavirus pandemic has put paid to any lingering possibility of the bout happening in the United Kingdom, but in reality an overseas location was always the plan. AJ’s promoter Eddie Hearn previously named Singapore, Dubai, Qatar, America and China as possible options, though Saudi Arabia was marked as the favourite to host Joshua vs. Fury. “We have a location, that’s true,” Arum told Barbershop Conversations “We have a location and, as far as the date is confirmed, we haven’t zeroed in on a date. “It could be as late as June because it would give more time to solve the coronavirus problem. By June, most people will be vaccinated, so it’s possible. “And then we would do the fight, pay-per-view in the UK and pay-per-view early evening in the United States.”
