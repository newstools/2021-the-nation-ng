A governorship aspirant in Anambra state, Sir Azuka Okwuosa has said that his interest to contest the November 6 gubernatorial poll was born out of his desire to provide true democracy and its dividends to the people of the state in line with the convictions of the late Igbo leader, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu. Okwuosa who is vying for the exalted seat in the state under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said he was mentored by the late Ikemba following his long association with him. He further revealed that Ojukwu created an indelible mark of greatness and potentials in his life and political activities, insisting that he could not have achieved such feat without his (Ojukwu) mentorship who he served, learned from and followed till death. He lamented what he described as the negative impact of bad administration of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) government in the State and its effect on the downward trend in the development of the State. Okwuosa, a former Commissioner in the State, Okwuosa restated his preparedness to return the state to its lost glory if elected. “What Anambra needs is a home-grown and experienced politician who lived amongst the people and understood the State properly,” he added. He promised soon availability of his campaign blueprint for the electorates to ascertain his grassroots disposition which was a plus for him to ameliorate the sufferings of the people through quality service delivery.
