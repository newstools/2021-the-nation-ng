The Police Command and the Ekiti State Government have dismissed speculations that some herdsmen fleeing Ondo State have relocated to the state. In two separate statements made available to journalists in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital on Wednesday, they said the claims about the herdsmen movement lack content of validity and the minutest modicum of truth. The Ekiti chapter of the Maize Grower Processing Marketer Association of Nigeria, (MAGPAMAN) had raised the alarm that some herdsmen from Ondo had stormed the state’s forests and carried out destructive activities on their farms. But, reacting to the claim, the Command, in a statement by its spokesman, ASP Abutu Sunday on behalf of Police Commissioner, Tunde Mobayo, said there was no evidence of herdsmen relocating to Ekiti based on its investigation on the matter. “The Command wishes to inform the general public, particularly the people of Ekiti State that it has neither sighted nor received any report of herders migrating or relocating into the State or its forest reserves.” Mobayo assured residents of adequate security, enjoining them to be vigilant and report any suspicious and strange movement to the nearest police station with their localities or call 0806 233 5577 for prompt action. Commissioner for Information, Akin Omole, debunked the invasion claim but confirmed there were only skirmishes that occurred at Aduloju farmstead in the state capital. He enjoined members of the public to go about their lawful businesses without fear of intimidation, adding that security agencies including the Amotekun Corps had beefed up security at the border communities. Omole reiterated the commitment of the Governor Kayode Fayemi-led government to the general wellbeing of people in the State, saying that security of lives and property is non-negotiable.
