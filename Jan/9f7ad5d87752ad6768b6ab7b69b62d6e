  As preparations for Ehingbeti, the Lagos Economic Summit holding on February 16 to 18, 2021, intensifies, the Organised Private Sector (OPS) has reaffirmed its commitment to the event, which it sees as a channel for setting developmental agenda for Lagos State. At a stakeholders’ conference recently, the OPS stressed the need for the government to focus on infratructural development, job creation, waste management, among others. “Chairman, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Ikeja branch Francis Meshioye, said: “The government should match manpower development with available needs to create room for employment. “There are many companies domiciled in Lagos. It needs more industrial clusters to become the desired economic hub, adding that government should create viable links to channel goods from one cluster to another.’’ Director-General, Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayoola Olukanni, said attention needed to be focused on municipal solid waste. Olukanni, who expressed support for the summit, said Lagos was still struggling with issues of waste management, which if not tackled, could become a disaster. According to him, there is a national policy on waste management, waste to energy, and wealth, which should be one of the studies at the summit.
