The Rivers State Government has distanced the state Governor, Nyesom Wike, from presidential campaign posters that flooded some major streets of Abuja on Monday. The Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, said Wike had never expressed any interest for the Presidency of the country. Nsirim said mischief-makers, who were threatened by the rising political profile of the governor were behind the posters. He said: “For the avoidance of doubt, Governor Wike has not informed anyone that he is interested in the Presidency of this country. This is certainly the handiwork of mischief makers who are threatened by the Governor’s rising political profile. We are amused that political detractors will stop at nothing to see how they can distract Governor Wike’s visionary leadership. “For the umpteenth time, we wish to restate that Governor Wike is presently preoccupied with his mission to make Rivers State a better place and Destination of Choice. “All the puerile antics of political jobbers aimed at heating up the polity will surely fail. Members of the public are therefore advised to discountenance the misinformation that is currently circulating in Abuja.”
