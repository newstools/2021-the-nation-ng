 NIGERIA international Kelechi Iheanacho and Ayoze Perez are set to fill in for the injured Jamie Vardy when Leicester visit Brentford in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday. Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers says Vardy, who has 13 goals in all competitions this season, will be out “for a few weeks” to have a minor hernia operation. The Foxes will also be without defender Wes Morgan and midfielder Dennis Praet. Championship side Brentford will be without top scorer Ivan Toney, who is suspended. Rodgers insisted his team would cope without Vardy. “We always try to rely on the collective, the group has always been able to find results,” said Rodgers. “When you don’t have one of the best strikers in the league around, it’s disappointing. I’ve got other great strikers – Ayoze Perez and Kelechi Iheanacho.” Toney is suspended after being sent off in stoppage time during Brentford’s win over Luton Town.
