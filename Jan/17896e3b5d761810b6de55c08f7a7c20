Bayelsa Assembly has denied speculation in some quarters that it is considering the impeachment of Governor Douye Diri. The Chairman, House Committee on Information, Mr Tare Porri, dispelled the rumour on Tuesday during a briefing at the Assembly Complex in Yenagoa, the state capital. Porri described the rumoured impeachment plot against Diri as unfounded and vexatious. He said: “Let me for the umpteenth time on behalf of the leadership of the sixth Bayelsa State House of Assembly under the Speaker, Abraham Ingobere, has never at any point contemplated carrying out impeachment against Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri. “As a matter of fact, the said rumour is unfounded, vexatious and it is targeted at distracting the hard-working sixth Bayelsa State House of Assembly. There is no feud between the state Assembly and the executive arm of government.” The lawmaker, who briefed journalists alongside the member representing Southern Ijaw Constituency 3, Moses Marlon, said there was no bitter disagreement between the Governor and the executive arm of government to warrant the legislature to plot his removal from office. Porri, who represents Ekeremor Constituency I under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said the Assembly under Ingobere’s leadership was rather working in synergy with Diri to deliver on his campaign promises to the people. He condemned the rumour peddlers and warned them to desist from it, stressing that the Assembly had never at any time planned to impeach Diri. He also wondered the impeachable offences reportedly committed by the governor contrary to the speculation that alleged disagreement over sharing of the recent N38.4bn refund for federal projects to the state government was the cause of the brouhaha.
