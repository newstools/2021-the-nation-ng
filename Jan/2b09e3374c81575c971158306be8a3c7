The death of five youths in Ode-Omi Community, Ogun Waterside Local Government Area of Ogun State, has been described as ‘mysterious’. Some community members described it as a strange illness. At an emergency stakeholders’ forum, they attributed the development to the neglect of community tradition. The Oshodi of Ode-Omi, Chief Oluwole Opele, accused the Caretaker Chairman, Femi Onanuga, of working against the tradition. Opele accused the council chief of trying to impose an Oba on the community. According to him, the community asked that the installation of a new monarch be suspended until rites for the late Oba, Adenuga Okunniyi Ojafoyewa, are completed. The chief however said Onanuga lied that the rites has been completed. He appealed to Governor Dapo Abiodun and the Awujale of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Adetona, to prevail on Onanuga not to rewrite their culture and tradition. But Onanuga described the accusation and ‘mysterious death’ as a false alarm. According to him, all necessary rites for the late monarch were concluded last July. The allegation, he said, was the antics of Chief Opele to frustrate the installation of a new monarch. Onanuga accused Opele of trying to impose himself as the Regent and chairman of Kingmakers. “He said: “All traditional rites for the late monarch had been concluded as at last July. The council is not in charge of selecting a monarch; we are just supervisory stakeholders. “We can’t do anything without recourse to the Ministry of Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs. “We have petitioned the police to investigate Opele on the five persons he said died mysteriously. There is peace in Ode-Omi. The death has nothing to do with the chieftaincy issue.”
