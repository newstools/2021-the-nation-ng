 SOLDIERS stationed at the Kugbo checkpoint on Thursday beat up five officials of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS), popularly called VIO for impounding a vehicle belonging to their senior colleague. The incident took place about 2:15pm. The senior army officer lodged a complaint at a military unit stationed at Kugbo opposite Mechanic Village that his car had been impounded by the Nyanya Command of DRTS. The Nation gathered that the driver of the impounded vehicle, who admited to not having a valid driver’s licence, had warned the VIO officers not to arrest the vehicle because it belonged to a military colonel. Military officials later pounced on VIO personnel, who took over from their colleagues who impounded the army vehicle, beating them mercilessly. The VIO officers scampered into the nearby hills and bushes for safety. All efforts to speak with Brigadier-General Sagir Musa, of the Army Public Relations, on the incident were futile as he did not answer the reporter’s calls.
