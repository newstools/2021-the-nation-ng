Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has urged US President Joe Biden to help with the anti-terror war and travel ban on Nigerians. He also called on Biden to strengthen the US-Nigeria relationship. In a statement titled: ‘Message of goodwill to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’, the former Vice President asked for Biden’s intervention in the many challenges facing Nigeria. He said: “As President Joe Biden begins his tenure as the 46th President of the United States of America, I am confident that this new era will mark America’s regeneration and her reaffirmation as the beacon of democracy to the world. “As I congratulate President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, I urge them and their administration to strengthen US-Nigeria ties and help our beloved nation’s war on terror by providing every type of support required to win our war against the insurgency we face and that threatens the peace of our sub region. “I also look forward to the removal of every travel restriction on Nigerian citizens, in keeping with the good relations that has existed between our two nations, beginning with the July 27, 1961 state visit of our first Prime Minister, Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, to President John F Kennedy, and continuing over the decades since then. “As the playwright, George Bernard Shaw once said, America and Nigeria are two nations divided by a common language. And millions of Nigerians and I wish to see that relationship sustained to the mutual benefit of both our democratic nations. “Congratulations once again and may God bless both our nations and bring about a beneficial tenure for your administration.”
