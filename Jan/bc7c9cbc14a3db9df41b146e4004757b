 Bruno Fernandes says he is desperate to win trophies at Manchester United, after scooping his latest individual award. The Portuguese star was named Premier League Player of the Month for December, his fourth such award since arriving from Sporting Lisbon only a year ago. Fernandes’ impact has transformed United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and they head to Anfield tomorrow to take on Liverpool tomorrow as Premier League leaders. The meeting with the defending champions will be a genuine test of United’s title credentials. “As I’ve always said, for me the most important thing is winning trophies – team trophies – because we’re a football team and it’s not just Bruno,” Fernandes said. “I want to win trophies with the team. Of course I’m very happy to win this award (for December’s Player of the Month). “These kind of awards make you happy and confident and to work even more, and to get more and more from yourself.
