No fewer than 28 persons have died in road crashes in Kaduna, Ondo and Kwara state. The crashes happened on Saturday and Sunday. Fifteen persons died on the Kaduna-Abuja Expressway, nine in the Ikare Akoko area of Ondo, and four in Kwara. The accidents on the Kaduna-Abuja Expressway were said to have been caused by driving against traffic. Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who confirmed the casualty figure, said the information was presented in a research feedback to the Kaduna State Government by the military and security agencies conducting  security operations along the route. “Seven persons died in the crash, with five injured, who are now receiving treatment in hospital. Troops and security agencies helped clear the site and ensure the normal flow of traffic,” he said. “Several other fatal accidents have occurred recently along the route, all caused by drivers switching lanes to drive against the normal flow of traffic, usually leading to head-on collisions with oncoming vehicles. “On Saturday morning, two lives were lost in such a crash around Olam Farms. Two days before that, four persons died in another crash close to the NYSC camp. A similar crash occurred last Wednesday, January 20th 2021. “Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed dismay at the report, and commiserated with the families of the deceased, while wishing the injured quick recovery.” Corps Public Education Officer Assistant Corps Marshal Bisi Kazeem said the Ondo accident occurred opposite the Adekunle Ajasin University campus, adding that  accident involved an articulated vehicle, a mini bus and a Lexus car. He blamed it on brake failure. The Kwata incident occurred at Otte town, close to Ilorin International Airport road along Ilorin-gbomoso highway.
