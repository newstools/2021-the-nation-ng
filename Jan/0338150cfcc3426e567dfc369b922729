One of the suspects, who took part in the cutting off of the private parts of a six-year old girl for suspected ritual purposes, Adamu Ra’uf, has said he was charmed by his friend, now at large, to partake in the act. The incident was said to have occurred last December 30 about 7:20pm. Ra’uf, 20, of Gandu Jama’are Local Government of Bauchi State, who was arrested by the police, confessed to have conspired with Abdulkadir Haladu of Chikamidari, Jama’are, to perpetrate the crime. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday at the police headquarters in Bauchi, Ra’uf said a native doctor assured his friend that he would help them  actualise their dream of becoming rich. Command spokesman Ahmed Wakil said Police Commissioner Lawan Jimeta  had directed that the case be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department  (SCID) for investigation. He said: “Abdulkadir is at large, but measures are being put in place for his arrest. Investigation is still on.”
