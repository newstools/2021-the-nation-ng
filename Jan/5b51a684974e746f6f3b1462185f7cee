The Chairman, Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Mr Abdullahi Candido has presented the council’s 2021 budget proposal in the tune of N10,087, 228, 268 billion to its legislative arm. Presenting the budget at the council’s legislative chambers in Abuja on Wednesday, Candido said the 2021 Budget tagged “Budget of Resilience,’ was aimed at bringing to the doorstep of every resident of the council, the dividends of democracy. He said despite the setbacks experienced by the council last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration was committed to rural transformation. The council chief said his administration had, however, allocated N4.37 billion for recurrent expenditure, representing 43.33 per cent and N5.71 billion for capital expenditure, representing 56.67 per cent of the budget. He added that the personnel cost is N2.75 billion, representing 28.56 per cent, while the overhead cost is N1.46 billion representing 14.77 per cent. Candido added that the increase in personnel cost is as a result of expected promotion of some members of staff and the proposed minimum wage increase as well as minimum wage arrears. On capital expenditure, he added that the thrust of AMAC capital projects this year will be the completion of many ongoing projects rather than initiating new ones.
