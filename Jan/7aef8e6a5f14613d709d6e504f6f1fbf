The Edo government has deployed 200 constabularies to three major local government areas for strict compliance of COVID-19 safety protocol. This is coming as the newly-posted Commissioner of Police in the state, Phillip Ogbadu, warned residents against violating the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew to stop the spread of COVID-19 in Edo. Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu, who addressed the constabularies, urged them to discharge their duties professionally. According to him, “You are going for a very important assignment, which is the enforcement of COVID-19 safety protocol in Oredo, Egor and Ikpoba-Oka local government areas. “You must ensure that all the eateries have hand washing facilities and encourage social distancing. “All eateries and banks in the council areas must not be crowded, while customers must be on queue for easy entry into those places.  “All the drivers, both private and commercial, and their passengers must also wear face mask.” Shaibu said any driver or passengers found not wearing a face mask should be arrested and prosecuted.  “You, as enforcers, must show good example by wearing your own face mask properly and you must now allow any gathering of more than 50 persons,” he said. The deputy governor expressed the regret that the second wave of COVID-19 had claimed more deaths than the first. He also declared that persons who refused to wear facemasks in public would be risking arrest and prosecution, thereby becoming ex-convicts. Ogbadu stated these yesterday at Government House, Benin, after he visited Governor Godwin Obaseki. The police chief said: “I wish to encourage the general public, especially the good people of Edo State, to always obey the restriction order emplaced by Edo State government. “COVID-19 pandemic is a reality of our time. The more we believe it, the more we have the ability to overcome it, by observing government set-out protocols and staying safe.”
