 Ekiti has ordered the resumption of academic session in public and private schools in the state on Monday. The curfew earlier imposed on the State from 8pm to 6am was also relaxed. It was relaxed to 10 pm -6am while the ban on gathering of more than 20 persons lifted to allow half capacity of venue for all events indoors. Information Commissioner, Hon. Akin Omole, who made these known in a statement in Ado-Ekiti on Sunday evening, stated that clearance must be obtained from the COVID-19 Taskforce for funerals, weddings, birthdays and other large social gatherings. Omole added that government workers on grade Level 12 and below are still excused from work until further notice. He explained the decision to reopen schools was taken to avoid the negative impacts on child health, education and development. He added that re-opening schools would also enable students to complete their studies and continue to the next level without avoidable additional burdens on family income and the overall economy of the people. The Commissioner stated that random testing of teachers and students would be carried out without delay, urging school administrators to comply with Covid-19 protocols in their respective schools. He emphasized that government would not hesitate to close any private or public school that violates stipulated Covid-19 guidelines.
