 THE kidnapped petroluem product dealer in Ekiti State, Alhaji Suleiman Akinbami has been freed after eight days in custody of his abductors. Akinbami was abducted at one of his petrol stations along Ado-Ijan Road around 9pm penultimate Sunday. The abductors had on Wednesday contacted his family demanding N60 million ransom. Police spokesman Sunday Abutu, who confirmed his release, said Akinbami was freed around 3pm on Sunday. Abutu added that no ransom was paid to secure the release of the business tycoon, saying it was as a result of concerted efforts of the police, hunters  and the Amotekun corps. Abutu said, “The man had reunited with his family. We assured the general public that we will get him out unhurt the very day he was kidnapped and that was exactly what we did”. But a source close to Akinbami’s family said the man paid ransom running into millions, which was raised  by combined efforts of the victim’s family, friends and business associates.
