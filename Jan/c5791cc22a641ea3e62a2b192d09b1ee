She hit on the back of the head,” the resident told Sunday Nation. But a Police source said the woman narrated that she and the husband had been having marital issues. “She said she had a misunderstanding with the husband. The husband slapped her and she seized the man on his shirt. And he slumped,” the Police source stated, adding that her claims will be verified when the corpse is seen by operatives. The security source further noted that the woman is in Police custody so that “if she is indicted, she won’t be difficult to arrest, and if she is free harm won’t come to her.” When reached for comments, the spokesperson of the Delta State Police Command said the Police are awaiting an official complaint from the family of the deceased.
