The Brazilian stuck out his foot to block Bruno Fernandes’ strike and then stood tall to save Paul Pogba’s shot. The match failed to live up to the hype – it was high on intensity, but both attacks found it difficult to pierce determined defences at Anfield. Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah had efforts blocked. If Manchester City defeat Crystal Palace in Sunday’s late game, they would only be two points behind United with a game in hand.
