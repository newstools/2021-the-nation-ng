The Chief Executive Officer of Al Hatyq Travel and Tours, Alhaji Mutiu Badmus has attributed denial of travel visa to intending travellers to irregularities of documentation, lack of evidence, and inability to convince the interviewer  at foreign embassies. The travel expert explained that embassies feel that if Nigerians travel to their country, they are not going to come back. Hence, they interview people and crosscheck details including bank statements to ascertain people are who they claim they are. He said: “In the past, people have supplied wrong information, so embassies have raised the bars. People do not have evidence for who they claim they are and are not able to prove what they claim they are earning. Only those who are able to convince their interviewer to get a visa.’’
