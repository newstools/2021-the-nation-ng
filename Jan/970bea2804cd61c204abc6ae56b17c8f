Freesia fitness and wellness centre has opened its doors for people desiring to stay fit and well in the heart of Ikeja. According to Goddy Amaezechi, Chairman/CEO of Freesia Wellness Centre, the fitness spot fulfils his aspiration of giving back to the society and creating employment for young Nigerians.  The grand opening is scheduled for Saturday. Addressing the media in Lagos, Amaezechi who is also into humanitarian services felt another way to engage people was to create the outfit as well as provide services that can encourage wellness. “This is a one-stop wellness centre. Our concept is to have everything in one roof. There is a gym, and we have also introduced aqua gym, which is a gym you do inside the pool. We have massage room. I do gym and so understand the importance of wellness and to be healthy. That is why I felt that could contribute to the wellness and fitness of people and also to help in the area of employment for our youths. He noted that Nigerians need to take keeping fit serious. “We want to create more awareness in this area of wellness and fitness to ensure that more people take exercise well because there is a lot of benefit in it,” Amaezechi added. The facility can accommodate eight people at a time in all the different sections.
