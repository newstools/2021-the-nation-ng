A semi-nude image shared by popular singer and songwriter, Deborah Oluwaseyi, popularly called Seyi Shay, has generated mixed reactions. The 35-year-old singer, who took to Instagram to share the image where she was lying unclad, also accompanied it with some lewd captions. “Good sex, no stress, one boo, no EX, small circles and big cheques,” she wrote on Instagram and also shared on Twitter. Nigerians took to social media to react. While some appraised her, some others condemned her actions. Here are few reactions culled from social media: @DwayneCarterDon said, “Some people just want to be known by all. The problem with this however, is that you will begin to pay too much attention to what people think of you and you will be scared to offend them even when you are on the side of truth” @thedoyinsola said: “I feel Seyi is trying so hard these days.” @Ellasvoice said: “Seyi Shay and BBN Ella have some things in common. They both come off as loners, always in their own world. I pray they find their balance” @enitan_12 said: “Why do I feel there’s more to the nude picture released by Seyi Shay. Guess someone must have took that picture of her and trynna blackmail her with it and dayummmmmm, girl took the courage pill to release it herself. A loss for the one who is trying to blackmail her though.” @BafemiIlesanmi said: “Pity. No hit songs lately. Suffering from an anxiety of influence.” @Therealizrel said: “When your fame is going under do something nasty, controversial or scandalous then the masses will put interest in your headline again. FAME 101.”
