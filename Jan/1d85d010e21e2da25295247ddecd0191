 THE zonal chairmanship ambition of Dr. Eddy Olafeso in the Southwest zone of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is receiving more boost daily. Olafeso, who enjoys the support of former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, reportedly just bagged the endorsement of some prominent leaders in Oyo State like Chief Nureni Akanbi, Alhaji Bisi Olopoeyan, and Femi Babalola, in spite of alleged objection to his choice by Governor Seyi Makinde. Reliable sources say former Osun State Governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, has also thrown his weight behind Fayose’s desire to have Olafeso returned as head of the party in the zone. Oyinlola heads the reconciliatory committee recently constituted by the governor’s faction of the PDP. Other notable chieftains of Oyo PDP said to be shifting support to Olafeso include Aranse Basiru, Dele Adigun, Baba Sunday Alabi, Alhaji Azeez Ajinowo, Malam Yusuf Akinyemi among others. Makinde and Chief Olabode George have not hidden their objection to Fayose’s scheme to install Olafeso as zonal chairman. This, sources claim, is at the heart of the tussle between the governor and Fayose. But recent developments have left observers of the ongoing intrigues within the opposition party wondering whether Makinde and his faction are losing grip in the struggle for the soul of the PDP in the Southwest. Or how else can one explain the daily show of support for Olafeso by notable chieftains of the party, hitherto believed to be in governor’s camp?
