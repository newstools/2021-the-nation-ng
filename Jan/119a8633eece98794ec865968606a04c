Nigerian singer Oludemilade Martin Alejo also known as Ycee has taken to his twitter account @iam_YCee to pray against heart breaks by Igbo women in 2021. The Nation recalls Igbo women trended on the social media for being heart breakers. It is believed that Igbo women are one of the most beautiful breeds of women, which they take advantage to siphon guys. It is also believed that what they care most about in a relationship is money. It seems YCee has once fallen victim of this at least. His tweet reads: “In 2021, Igbo women will not break my heart this year…. So help me God.”
