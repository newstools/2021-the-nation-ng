Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu has declared the organisation cannot work with the newly appointed President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. George Obiozor, because he was allegedly imposed on the Igbo socio-cultural body by the Fulani cabal. Kanu, who spoke in a statement by the IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, alleged a powerful presidential aide and Miyetti Allah were instrumental to the emergence of Obiozor as Ohaneze President General. According to him, IPOB closely monitored the jamboree election that produced Obiozor as the new Ohanaeze helmsman, critically analysed the antecedents of those behind his emergence and came to the conclusion “we cannot in all honesty work with him because we are not ideologically compatible. “Obiozor may not be entirely evil but those behind him are unrepentant enemies of Biafra. Naturally, he can only do the bidding of his sponsors, thus sacrificing Igbo Biafra interest at the altar of few self-centered political desperados. “IPOB cannot work with a man we know will be remote-controlled by a Fulani terrorist group in the shape of Miyetti Allah and by extension the Federal Government of Nigeria.” He also said that IPOB cannot work with people currently clamouring for a President of Igbo extraction in 2023 because “we know their real motives. None of the traitors on parade have Igbo Biafra’s interest at heart. They are only after their personal gains going by their antecedents. “It’s still fresh on our minds what transpired at Jos PDP convention when the late Dr Alex Ekwueme contested for the candidature of the President of Nigeria under PDP in 1999. “Then the likes of Jim Nwobodo, Orji Uzo Kalu and virtually every other Igbo delegate at that convention voted against him. These Igbo men sabotaged Igbo presidency then, what has changed since 1999 that will make them come out now to shamefully clamour for the same Igbo presidency they publicly rejected in 1999.”
