 Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar is undoubtedly one of the most successful businessmen and politicians in Nigeria. But becoming the president still remains on his bucket list and he is doing everything to achieve that. Inasmuch as Atiku has his businesses in Nigeria, for reasons best known to him, he sees comfort in staying in Dubai. Social Circuit gathered that he had been living in Dubai since he lost the last presidential election to President Muhammadu Buhari. This was also confirmed by a social commentator, Deji Adeyanju, during the week, asking him why he chose to live overseas and only come back to Nigeria when it was time for election. He said: “Atiku has spent over two years in Dubai since he lost last election. He only came back for his children’s wedding and went back. He will come back in 2023 to say he wants to be president. Why not contest for a position in Dubai?” After working in the Nigeria Customs Service for twenty years where he rose to become Deputy Director, he retired and ventured fully into business and politics. He started out in real estate business during his days as a Customs officer before venturing into agriculture, logistics, telecommunications, manufacturing of beverages and education.
