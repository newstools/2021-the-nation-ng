The Independent National Electoral Commission on Tuesday opened its defence in the petition filed by the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party and its governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, at the Ondo State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Akure. Jegede is asking the tribunal to nullify the October 10 governorship election won by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and declare him a winner. He closed his case after testifying as a witness and opted not to call any of the 400 witnesses listed to testify. At the resumed hearing of the petition, an official of INEC, Mr Tope Aina, during cross-examination said he has worked for the agency for 30 years. Mr. Aina told the tribunal that there was no objection from anybody including the petitioners when the commission published the name of Governor Akeredolu and particulars as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress on July 31st, 2020. Aina said he did not agree with the petitioner that votes scored by Governor Akeredolu were wrongly credited. He said the October 10 governorship election was free, fair and conducted in compliance with the Electoral Act. When cross-examined by Counsel to Jegede, Onyechi Ikpeazu, Aina stated that he could not recall whether Alhaji Ahmed Markafi was a serving governor when he presided over the affairs of the PDP. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Umar Abubakar, adjourned sitting to January 20 for further hearing.
