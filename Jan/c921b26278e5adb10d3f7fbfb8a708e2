 CRIMINAL activities declined across the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and its environs during the Yuletide, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) said on Tuesday. The Corps attributed the development to the synergy among security agencies in providing the needed security for critical assets and residents of the FCT. The FCT Commandant of the NSCDC, Commandant Mathias Ohieme, who stated this in Abuja also commended the residents of the FCT for maintaining peace and order during the holidays. Ohieme, in a statement signed by Head, Public Relations Office PRO unit, Assistant Commandant Akinbinu David revealed that the Command would likely increase street patrols, in order to maintain and improve on the security of the area so as to ensure a crime-free 2021. The statement reads: â€œAs safety remains significant and a major concern, the NSCDC will not relent in taking the necessary measures to ensure the safety of lives and property of the people and the nation.
