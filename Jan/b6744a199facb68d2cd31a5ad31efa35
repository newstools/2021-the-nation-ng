No fewer than forty workers of Louis Carter Industries Limited, Nnewi, Anambra State, have been rendered jobless following the fire incident that razed a section of the company last weekend. The multimillion motorcycle spare parts factory was reportedly gutted by the inferno, destroying property worth over N500million. The General Manager of the firm, Engr Ndubisi Okoli in a chat with newsmen during an on-the-spot assessment of the extent of damage, said the affected workers had been hanging around the factory with no job to do. He said the incident had thrown the company into confusion as to how to handle the situation. He said, “We’ve sent a Save-Our-Soul message to both Federal and State governments to come to our rescue to enable us reinstate over 40 workers rendered jobless because of the incident that had reduced a section of the company to rubbles. “Since after the incident, some of the workers come in the morning and hang around to see what the company has to tell them. It is pathetic indeed and we cannot easily redeploy them to other sections of the company where there are already workers. “They are eager to work but their section has been razed by fire. Most of them are married youths with young families. Do we allow them to go back to society again to start causing havoc and all sorts of things because of joblessness? “The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Chief Louis Onwugbenu is worried and we are all thinking of what to do.” According to Okoli, the multi-product manufacturer of versatile plastic products and auto components had been contributing meaningfully to the state economy and the nation generally. “The saving grace will be immediate
interventions of both governments to re-acquire some burnt equipment and rebuild the burnt section to enable the company continue in its contribution to the economic development and job creation in the State,” he added.
