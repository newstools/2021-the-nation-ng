 A FORMER President of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Dr. Deji Akinwalere, has suggested the conferment of a national honour on a former National Chairman of Labour Party (LP), Alhaji Abdulkadri Abdulsalam. The late Abdulsalam was the General Secretary of NULGE for over 20 years. Akinwalere, who was National President of the union when Salam, as the late LP national was fondly called by admirers, was General Secretary, described him as a labour veteran and seasoned administrator who deployed his uncommon managerial skill to keep NULGE together as one despite internal differences which often posed a threat to the unity of the union.
