Ekiti State Government has begun the demolition of dilapidated and sub-standard buildings in the 532 primary schools across the 16 local governments. It said the step was necessary because some of the dilapidated structures had become death traps for pupils and hideouts for criminals. The Chairman of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Prof Femi Akinwumi, launching the demolition on Monday at Mount Mary Nursery/Primary School, Oke Ila, Ado- Ekiti, said the exercise was conceptualised by the Governor Kayode Fayemi administration to allow the construction of buildings across primary schools. He added that some of the structures were built during the pre-colonial days, dating back to 1920, making them outdated for the new age. “Under this programme, mud and substandard blocks must go down. We have to check the miscreants that are using dilapidated buildings in our primary schools as hideouts, because we are aware some people use these places as abode. “We are training about 761 new teachers, which was a follow up to over 2,700 teachers that were trained in 2020. We are providing a conducive environment and enhancing the capacities of our personnel. “With this demolition and construction of new buildings, pupils can move around and enjoy the aesthetic environment we are going to provide without fear of attack by hoodlums. They will also enjoy the beauty,” Akinwumi said. The government warned the newly recruited 1,000 primary school teachers against presenting fake certificates, saying anyone caught would be dismissed and sanctioned.
