The Association of Proprietor of Football Academies of Nigeria (APFAN) has concluded plans towards holding the Late Olubayo Adefemi U17 Football Tournament in the first quarter of 2021. According to APFAN national president, Dr Francis Akinremi, the association has reached advanced stage in talks with the family of the late Nigeria national team players. The APFAN boss has described the tournament as a breeding ground for talented youngsters who eventually get picked up by clubs in the country’s soccer leagues and clubs abroad. APFAN successfully held the Tajudeen Ajide U20 Football Championship in 2020 with Ify Babes defeating Puma Academy to win the maiden edition at the Legacy Pitch of the Lagos National Stadium, Surulere.
