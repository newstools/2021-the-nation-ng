House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for Donald Trump’s immediate removal through the 25th Amendment. The Speaker has said if this does not happen, the president should be impeached – for the second time – instead. “In calling for this seditious act, the president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,” Pelosi said. She described Trump as “a very dangerous person who should not continue in office.” She, however, called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of President Trump if he is unable to discharge his duties. Also, Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer earlier on Thursday called for the invocation of the 25th Amendment. Schumer said that if they failed to act, Congress should reconvene and impeach him.
