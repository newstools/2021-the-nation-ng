The remains of an abducted farmer Wole Agboola have been recovered from the bush in Aba-Odo, Oyo State, a few miles from where he was abducted. Sources said Agboola was killed after his family paid about N2 million ransom to his abductors. A family source said they were expecting Agboola’s release four days after the ransom was paid, prompting a police search of the forests where his decomposing body was later found. Agboola was abducted on his farm at Aba-Odo in Akinyele council area of the state on December 28, 2020. The abductors were described as herders wearing army uniform. A brother to the deceased, Olakunle Agboola, confirmed the killing and the ransom payment. Kunle said, “My brother, Wole Agboola was killed after a huge ransom was paid and we later found his body inside the bush near Aba Odo close to where he was abducted.”
