 BRITAIN on Friday recorded 1,325 more COVID-19 fatalities, its highest since the pandemic began. The announcement came moments after London Mayor Sadiq Khan declared a ‘major incident’ in respect of COVID-19 in the UK capital, saying the spread of the virus was “out of control”. The death toll doubled within a week with infections reaching a record-high 68,053. Experts fear it may yet rise further because of spiraling cases leading to more hospitalisations. The figure is a 116.2 per cent jump on penultimate Friday, when 613 deaths were registered. Friday record cases, according to the London Mail were also a 27.7 per cent rise on the same time last week, when 53,285 were recorded. More than 50,000 infections have been registered every day for the last 11 days, meaning over half a million people have been diagnosed with the disease in less than a fortnight.
