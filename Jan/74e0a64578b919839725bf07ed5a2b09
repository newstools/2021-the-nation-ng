Property worth over N500 million has been destroyed in a midnight fire at a motorcycle spare parts factory in Nnewi, Anambra State. The facility is part of Louis Carter Industries Nigeria Limited. The fire was said to have started about 10pm on Saturday, raging for six hours amid interventions by fire service men who arrived one and a half hours late. General Manager of the company, Mr Ndubisi Okoli said he was alerted by the company’s security men who said the blaze could not be contained with the factory’s fire extinguishers due to the intensity of the fire. He attributed the fire to a spark on a high tension cable of the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC). “The high tension cable sparked and spread fire to a section of the factory which destroyed raw materials and crushed machines worth over N500 million. “Though no life was lost, the building was completely razed,” Okoli lamented. Chief Executive Officer of Louis Carter Group of Companies, Chief Louis Onwugbenu said, “Only God knows how much it will cost me to rebuild the factory. Worse still is the number of workers that have been thrown out of job as a result.” While appealing to Governor Willie Obiano for assistance, Onwugbenu said the reconstruction of the road leading to the company from the major highway would help a great deal.
