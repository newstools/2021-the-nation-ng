 Aba fans were in attendance at the Enyimba International Stadium on Sunday to cheer People’s Elephants to victory against Wikki Tourists in Matchday three of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) clash against laid down protocols  on  COVID 19 rules that  matches should be played behind closed doors. It is yet unclear whether League Management Company (LMC) has given waiver to Enyimba to allow their fans in the stadium during their home games. The hosts won the game 1-0 courtesy of Nabil Yarou’s debut league goal  for Enyimba as he rose high enough to nod home Stanley Okorom’s corner kick. Wikki Tourists media officer Nasiru Kobi in one of his social media accounts, decried the nonchalant attitude of the management of Enyimba FC for allowing their fans to watch the game without considering the rules. According to him: “The COVID 19 protocols which States that all matches be played under close door has been violated here as fans of Enyimba were allowed into the stadium intimidating the visiting team and cheering their team.” Enyimba’s Media Officer Zazi Bariza, however, denied the report, stressing that: “Good evening. Fans were not allowed into the stadium,” Bariza said via a text message.
