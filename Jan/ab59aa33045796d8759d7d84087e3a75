 German coach Gernot Rohr said his objective at the dawn of Year 2021 was to ensure  the Super Eagles prompt qualification  for the next  Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) to be held in Cameroun ahead of a good start towards the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The Rohr-led side floundered in their AFCON campaign in November after an infamous 4-4 home draw in Benin against Sierra Leone was equally followed by a listless goalless draw away in Freetown. But Rohr has reaffirmed to ensure the team’s successive qualification  for the AFCON under his watch after he guided  them to a third-place finish at the last outing at Egypt 2019. “For the new year, we hope that all our players, coaches and officials can start in good health and the unity we need with the sports ministry will bring our football further,” the 67-year-old former Bordeaux coach told NationSports.“ We hope to get good infrastructures to play in Abuja with our fans in the stadium.” He stated further: “2021 should also be  the year of qualification for AFCON and a good start for the World Cup qualifiers; our offensive football with young players will continue and results will follow.” Rohr has been in charge of the Super Eagles since 2016 and his  arrival coincided with the team’s qualification for the  Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup  and   qualification for the 2019 AFCON; his contract has since further extended till 2022. Pressed on possible recruitment of fresh talents to boost the quality of the Super Eagles, Rohr admitted the team is still a work in progress: “The scouting of new players continues but they must be better than the boys we have already. “Happy new year to all Nigerians!” he noted.
