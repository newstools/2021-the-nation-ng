The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has expressed displeasure over the call by the Muslim Solidarity Forum on the Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Bishop Matthew Kukah, to apologise for his alleged attack on Islam and Muslims or leave the Caliphate. The forum, which labelled itself as an umbrella body for Islamic organisations, scholars and clerics, last Tuesday asked Kukah to apologise or leave the state, insisting that his Christmas message was capable of triggering religious violence in the country. Reacting to the development, CAN described the call for Kukah to apologize as ‘no issue’ adding that he is saying the truth. The General Secretary of CAN, Barrister Joseph Daramola, who spoke with our correspondent on Wednesday said: “there is no issue there. Why are they personifying the matter. The man (Kukah) is saying the truth and they trying to put religious politics into it. This people are myopic in everything they are doing. Let them go and read his message. What do they want to do to him? Why would he apologise?” Kukah’s homily also drew censures from the federal government and the Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), led by Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, which attacked the bishop for allegedly denigrating Islam and Muslims.
