Popular talking drummer, Gabriel Johnson, otherwise known as Gabination, has married his longtime girlfriend, Oyindamola. The pair tied the knot over the weekend after a four years courtship. Gabination told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that marrying Oyindamola was a dream come true, adding that it was a special moment for him the moment they both kissed like a couple in front of everyone. He said, “I really can’t contain my excitement. Honestly, I’ve been filled with overwhelming joy getting married to the love of my life. It was a special moment for me when we were declared as a couple, after which we kissed.” Lamenting how COVID-19 restricted the extent to which he could have done the wedding, Gabination said he can’t wait to annually celebrate his union with Oyindamola. “I’m so happy to be committed to spending the rest of my life with her. She’s a virtuous woman. Although, we wish we could have every single one of our friends and family there,” he said.  (NAN)
