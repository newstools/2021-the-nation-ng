 JUVENTUS forward Cristiano Ronaldo has overtaken Pele on the list of top goal scorers in the history of professional football. Ronaldo netted his 757th  and 758th  career goals in Sunday’s 4-1 win over Udinese, moving him one ahead of Brazil legend Pele, who racked up 757 officially recognised goals during his career with Santos and New York Cosmos. Ronaldo is now one ahead of Pele as his 83rd goal for Juventus took him to 758 for club and country. The Portugal international sits on 102 goals for his country, adding to the 450 he managed for Real Madrid, his 118 for Manchester United and the five he managed during his time with Sporting CP. The record is currently held by Slavia Prague legend Josef Bican, who racked up 759 goals between 1931 and 1955 while playing across Austria and the Czech Republic. That means Ronaldo, who sits on 18 goals from 15 games so far this season, needs just one to tie the record and two to make it his own. Ronaldo’s first chance to break the record will come tomorrow  when Juventus travel to Serie A leaders AC Milan, but he’ll be confident of having moved to the top of the mountain by the time the meeting with Sassuolo comes to an end the following Sunday.
