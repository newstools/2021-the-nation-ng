Police have recovered 13 locally-fabricated guns, and arrested some suspects in Niger State. The weapons were in various stages of fabrication before operatives swooped on the suspects. The guns were recovered from two sets of suspects, one of them a fabricator. One of the suspects, John Shugaba, who claimed to be a member of a vigilante group, said that they contracted one Titus Ishaku, a welder, to fabricate the guns for him at the rate of N3000. Another suspect, Alex Yohana, 28, was arrested on Kasabo/Agwara Road. He was arrested with two locally-fabricated double-barrel guns which he claimed to have bought for N40,000. Police spokesman Abiodun Wasiu said the cases are under investigations and that the suspects would be charged to court upon completion of the investigation. Twelve suspects were arrested for armed robbery and unlawful possession of firearms, Abiodun said.
