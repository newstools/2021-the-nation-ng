  Nigeria  striker Lawal Olamilekan on Tuesday  opened his  goal scoring account  for Olympic  Sporting  Club  in the  Egyptian FA Cup  match following his side’s  3-2 win over MSR Elslom. Incidentally, the FA Cup was Olamilekan’s third game for El-Olympi since he was snapped up a fortnight ago from Imo State-based Brighter Tomorrow Football Club under the auspices of forward-looking manager Emeka Darlington. He made his  debut  in a 2-2 draw  against Mansura  in a league tie  and was also featured in his side’s 3-1 away win  against El Hamam. On Tuesday, the 19-year-old  scored his side’s first  goal of the encounter  and assisted  Mustafa Koshra for the  second while Mohammed Al –Adesi  scored the third goal  through penalty. “Of course, Olamilekan had a very good game and scoring his first goal for El-Olympi would boost his confidence,” Darlington declared. “It was his third game for the El-Olympi and scoring today is a big plus for him.” Incidentally, the second division team is coached by former Egyptian international and erstwhile Zamalek striker, coach Ahmed El Kass where Darlington believed Olamilekan would blossomed. “Olamilekan is definitely in good hands with Coach Ahmed El Kass at Olympic Club,” Darlington noted. “Coach El Kass was a great striker in his days with Zamalek and I’m confident, Olamilekan will learn so much from him.”
