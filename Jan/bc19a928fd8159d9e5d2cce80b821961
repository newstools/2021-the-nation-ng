The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue State may soon erupt in a fierce intra-party squabbles if reports that Governor Samuel Ortom is planning to move to the senate in 2023 turn out to be true. Reports of Ortom wanting to supplant incumbent Senator Orker Jev and take over the Benue North West seat after the expiration of his second term are rife and fast spreading. But neither the governor nor his spokespersons have confirmed it. Sentry, however, learnt that some chieftains of the ruling party are gradually coming out to openly support the ‘Ortom for Senate’ agenda. “When you start seeing some categories of politicians propagating an agenda, you can easily say whether it will remain a rumour or assume a life of its own soon,” the source said. Also, Senator Jev has been forced to speak out on the matter, sending signals that there may be more to the stories making the rounds in Benue North West. Responding to a question on the rumoured interest of the governor in his seat, Jev said he and Ortom had resolved not to allow anything to sour the relationship they had built over time. A smart response you will say. Well, it is left to be seen if a contest between the two buddies in 2023 will sour their relationship or not.
