Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike said with his level of performance in office, it would be difficult for any other party to take Rivers State away from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Wike insisted he had conducted the affairs of governance without discrimination, saying his administration an inclusive policy in project distribution. The governor said he laid a good foundation of leadership by completing all the projects he inherited from his predecessor and would complete all the projects that he initiated so that his successor would have a smooth sail in governance. He said: “No matter the tactics they deplore, no party can take Rivers State away from PDP. They have to convince the people why they need the support of Rivers people. It is already known, they have nothing to offer. “We have something to offer and we have offered it to the people. They are angry that we are commissioning projects. Our business as a party is to make the other people have serious high blood pressure. “Anywhere they are now they are crying that we are in every local government inaugurating projects. We are not vindictive. We are a government that carries everybody along”.
