The Yoruba Ronu Leadership Forum has said people have the right to secure their communities. The group, in a statement by its president, Akin Malaolu, urged the people in Southwest to keep watchful eyes on criminal activities. Its statement reads: “The security challenges, which the nation faces today, are general and since the APC government of Muhammad Buhari has failed, other fair interventions become inevitable. The presidency and governors must partner with the likes of Igboho to encourage community participation in security to improve security conditions in the Southwest and all over Nigeria. Vilifying him through unnecessary threats is unreasonable. “So far, the people have felt reassured that criminal activities can be stemmed if required desire and energy are put to use and that is exactly what Igboho is offering. “As one of the leaders of thought in the Southwest, our advice is that the innocent are not punished, homesteads are not burnt, and peaceful Nigerians are assisted to remain in the Southwest to pursue their legitimate interests.”
