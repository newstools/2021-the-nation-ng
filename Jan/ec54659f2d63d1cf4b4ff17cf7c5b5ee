The Director-General of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, has said the agency is grooming some Nigerian companies that have the capacity to address oil spills. This decision, he said, was taken as soon as the lockdown started in March 2020, knowing there was complete restriction of movement globally. Musa noted that the agency is not resting as it has partnered stakeholders in oil spillage response. He added that the agency has assigned officers to all oil companies should there be any spillage, and assure Nigerians that all assigned officers went through COVID-19 protocols. Oil spill is accidental he said, adding that though the country has not had cause to bring about a national oil spill contingency plan,  there have been spills which had to be restricted to 1-2 contingency plan.
