 THE second wave of COVID-19 has forced Kano State House of Assembly to postpone its resumption. The Speaker of the House of Assembly, Hon. Hamisu Ibrahim-Chidari, said in a statement in Kano that the legislators will remain at home until further notice, in compliance with the stay-at-home directive of the state government. The Assembly was scheduled to resume on Monday, January 25, but Ibrahim-Chidari said “the virus is back.” He appealed to residents of the state, “especially religious leaders to continue to pray for the end of the pandemic, not only in Kano, but in the country.” He also asked the public to adhere to the COVID-19 safety protocols as directed by experts and to keep supporting the government in preventing the spread of the virus. The state government had directed civil servants to stay at home, pending further directives. The state government however said schools were not affected by the order and that teachers and other members of staff should continue with their normal duties.
