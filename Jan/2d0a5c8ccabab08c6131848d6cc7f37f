A judicial panel set up by the Oyo State Government to investigate police brutality in the wake of #EndSARS protest will begin public hearing by end of this month, The Nation has learnt. The panel was set up by Governor Seyi Makinde last November as directed by the Federal Government. The panel, headed by retired chief justice Bolajoko Adeniji, will conduct investigations into cases of abuse by members of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria Police in Oyo State in the last few years. It will recommend compensation for victims or their families in case of death. Mrs Oluwafolake Ogundele, an assistant director at the Department of Public Prosecutions, Ministry of Justice, is secretary. Other members include Prof. Odutayo Akintayo, Dr Oluwole Akintayo, Mrs Wumi Odutayo, Mr Nasir Sulaimon, Ms Mary Kolawole, Mr Babatunde Oduyoye, Mrs Maryan Badmus, Mr Falowo Saheed and Mr Agbeja Adebola. The Assistant Commissioner of Police, Osun Command and two officers of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad identified as Odua and Aare have been summoned to appear before a panel of inquiry investigating police brutality and extra-judicial killing. The Nation recalls that Mr Ayinla Rasheed, a father of an ram merchant, testifying before the panel, alleged that his son, Ismaila Rasheed, was killed inside his hotel room and robbed of millions of Naira. The Manager of Ile Labo Guest House, Iwo, Mr Afeez Adio, corroborating the testimony of the deceasedâ€™s father, indicted two officers of the defunct SARS named Aare and Odua.
