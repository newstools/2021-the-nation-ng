The Maiduguri Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned Aisha Alkali Wakili (aka Mama Boko Haram) for alleged fresh fraud. Wakili was arraigned on Monday before Justice Aisha Kumaliya of the Borno State High Court, sitting in Maiduguri, the state capital, on a fresh three count charge involving   criminal conspiracy and obtaining N41,777,750.00 by false pretence. She was arraigned alongside Tahiru Saidu Daura, and Prince Lawal Shoyede, Programme Manager and Country Director of Complete Care and Aid Foundation, a non-governmental organization (NGO). The trio allegedly induced Hajia Bilkisu Mohammed Abubakar for a supply contract worth N41 million for Complete Care and Aid Foundation, which belongs to Mama Boko Haram but which he refused to pay for after the deed had been done. All the defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecuting counsel, Haruna Abdulkadirn, prayed the court to fix a date for trial, to enable the first and third defendants, who did not have legal representation, to do so at the next hearing. Justice Kumaliya adjourned the matter till January 26for commencement of trial. He also ordered Wakili and Shoyede to engage the services of counsel, but that in the event that they fail, the EFCC would be at liberty to proceed with its case without their counsel.
