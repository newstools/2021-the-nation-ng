The Federal Government has approved two Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDTs) kits manufactured by SD Biosensor and Abbott for covid-19 testing. It explained that while RDTs provide a faster turnaround time compared to the molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, there are limitations with its test. It noted that the RDTs, which will be deployed in congregate settings – schools, hospitals, NYSC camps, military camps, prisons, etc., has a lower sensitivity compared to PCR tests. To curb this, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control’s (NCDC’s) new guideline for RDTs deployment in the country has algorithms to ensure that cases are not missed. A statement by the NCDC in Abuja said: “The NCDC has published new guidance for state governments, public and private institutions on the use of approved Antigen (Ag) based Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). “In September 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) of two Ag RDTs, manufactured by SD Biosensor and Abbott for COVID-19 testing. Following this, the NCDC, in collaboration with other stakeholders, carried out a national validation of these RDTs. The validation, which was carried out during the screening held at National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camps, showed that the RDTs meet the minimal standards for sensitivity and specificity of COVID 19 diagnostic tests. As more Ag RDTs gain EUA from WHO, we will consider their use in Nigeria. “This new guidance published by NCDC, is to guide the use of RDTs in Nigeria. We are recommending its use, primarily in congregate settings. These include settings such as schools, hospitals for the testing of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 presenting in hospital triage areas and periodic testing of health care workers, as well as prisons etc.”
