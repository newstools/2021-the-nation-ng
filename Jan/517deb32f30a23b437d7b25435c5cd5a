 At a small gathering of journalists recently, a friend wanted to describe the Oluwo of Iwo land, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, but he struggled to remember his name. These were the words that came out: “I am talking about that king who likes wearing “colourful things.” Everyone laughed at his weird description, but it was a perfect way to describe the monarch as people immediately knew he meant Oba Akanbi. At public functions, it is easy to spot him due to his love for colourful attires, especially the popular Yoruba ‘Aso oke.’ Reacting to his style in an interview in 2018, Oluwo said: “People don’t want to understand anything. People have bad belle, some don’t even like the way I dress. The way I add swag, the way I move around even people don’t like you for being beautiful.” Apart from his youthful age, he has used the stool to impact Iwo town. Recently, when he celebrated his fifth anniversary on the stool, his people used the occasion to honour him.
