You’re enough because you are. You’re special because you are. Not because people say you are. Don’t let fickle human beings determine how you feel about yourself. When you see that you’re doing something to impress people, don’t do it. Be comfortable with people not liking something you like etc…Ya dig?” Another fan asked if she would be happy should her daughter Deja turn out to be a musician, Simi responded “I will be happy as long as she’s happy”.
