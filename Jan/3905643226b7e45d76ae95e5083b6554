An Edo Magistrate Court sitting in Oredo Magisterial District has convicted 17 persons for violating a curfew imposed by the state government. The curfew restricts movement between 10p.m. to 5a.m. to check the spread of the second wave of COVID-19. The Chief Magistrate of the Mobile Court, Bright Eraze Oniha, sentenced the violators to three hours of community service within the court premises as punishment, after they all pleaded guilty.
