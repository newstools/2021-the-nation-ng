The Adamawa State Government, expressing worry about lack of compliance with COVID-19 restrictions, has announced that it may introduce stricter measures. It has also hinted at the likelihood of shutting clubs, event centres and other businesses that do not comply with COVID-19 rules in their operations. The government said in a statement by Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, Press Secretary to Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, that its fresh resolve derived from identification of a new variant of the COVID-19 virus and directives by the Presidential Task Force on the disease. The government added that its renewed focus is meant to intensify things to bring the rate of COVID-19 infections down. The government reminded the people that wearing of face mask, social distancing, washing of hands, restriction of movement from 10pm to 5am and social gatherings of more than 50 people at a time are still in force. It stated, “The general public is hereby called upon to adhere strictly to the provisions of the guidelines namely; compulsory use of face masks in any public gathering or public transport. Social distancing in any gathering. Ensure washing of hands and use of sanitizers. “Hospitality businesses such as Clubs, Cinema halls, Event centres, Conferences and Congresses and other similar gatherings with population beyond 100 remain banned. Leaders at Worship centres are therein advised to ensure use of face mask by all, while ensuring social distancing.” The government warned that “Any Club, Event centre or business premises so directed found contravening this rule will be closed down”, adding that it was “of the view that we should not wait, as happened earlier, for this virus to again spiral out of control before taking action.”
