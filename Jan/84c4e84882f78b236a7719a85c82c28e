Pep Guardiola says Manchester City can take nothing for granted against bottom of the table Sheffield United. However, Guardiola says there is no room for complacency in the Premier League, highlighting the visitors midweek win over Manchester United as proof of how competitive England’s top division is. “One of the special things about the Premier League is that anything can happen,” he said at his pre-match press conference. “Nothing is guaranteed. We don’t have to go back [to remind ourselves how difficult the Premier League is] as much because a few days ago they won at Old Trafford. “That’s the Premier League. Everybody knows how difficult it is in every single game. “You have to try and do as best as possible and see what happens.”
