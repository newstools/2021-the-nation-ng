Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, a member of Standard Bank Group, has donated a vocational centre to one of its host communities. The Finance Department of the organisation built the centre at the Borstal Training Institute (BTI), Abeokuta, Ogun State, as part of its Corporate Social Investment (CSI) initiative. The BTI is the Nigerian Correctional Service’s juvenile arm, set up to correct, train, reform, rehabilitate, and reintegrate young offenders. Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC  Head, Sustainability, Omolola Fashesin,said: “At Stanbic IBTC, we pay strong attention to empowerment, being one of the pillars around which our CSI initiative revolves. We delight in seeing people succeed and advance financially, and we empower them to be able to make and act on economic decisions.”  She added: “To achieve societal and economic empowerment, young people need the skills and resources to compete in markets, as well as fair and equal access to economic institutions. This is what we provide at Stanbic IBTC. It is the beginning of a cumulative process that will allow these young men to develop the knowledge, skills and confidence they need to succeed.” Comptroller of Corrections, Ogun State Command, Mojeed Adeniran, noted that the donation would help the skill development of the inmates. Executive Director, Prisoners’ Rights Advocacy Initiative, Ahmed Adetola Kazeem,  urged other corporate organisations to match the commitment to social and economic growth, as displayed by Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC. He noted that the centre would help transform the lives of young inmates at the facility, empowering them to be better citizens while contributing their quota to the nation’s development.
