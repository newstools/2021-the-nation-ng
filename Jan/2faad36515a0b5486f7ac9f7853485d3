 A FORMER Dean, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Ilorin (UNILORIN), Prof Abiodun Adeloye,  has  expressed concerns of possible exports restriction amid the new wave of COVID-19. Speaking with The Nation, Adeloye sees agricultural issues among the major sticking points to  keep  domestic economies safe. He expected the coronavirus outbreak to spark a rise in global protectionism as countries seek to secure local supplies. Adeloye noted that there was the possibility of countries imposing export restrictions. He maintained that there was the need for Nigeria to increase local reserve  of  food  to prepare again any  restrictions  following  protectionism to stimulate domestic industry. Last November, COVID-19 new wave shut European Union (EU) market for flower exporters.
