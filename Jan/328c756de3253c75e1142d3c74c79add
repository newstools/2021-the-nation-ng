Asisat Oshoala scored a brace as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 4-1 in the first El Classico to be played at the Johan Cruyff Stadium. Barcawere on the attack from the beginning of the game and Alexia gave them the lead via an absolutely wicked shot in the 14th minute. The Real Madrid keeper got a hand to it, but she only succeeded in helping the ball into the net because the shot was to powerful. Jenni Hermoso extended the lead in the 17th minute off a rebound from a shot by Oshoala and then, in the 37th minute, deadly Norwegian winger, Caroline Graham Hansen ran at full speed down the right while Oshoala was running down the center. CGH centered the ball and Oshoala knocked it into the net. It was a thing of beauty.
