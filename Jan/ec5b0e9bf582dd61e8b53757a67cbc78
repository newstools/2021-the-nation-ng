 Nigerian investors appear to be showing greater consideration for low-priced stocks, otherwise known as penny stocks, as several investors sought to unlock gains in mid and large-cap stocks. Penny stocks, named because of their relatively low prices, usually around 100 kobo mark, have dominated transactions in recent trading sessions, with increased demand pushing several penny stocks atop activities and pricing charts. Trading data at the weekend showed that three low-priced stocks were the three most active stocks last week, accounting for 36.9 per cent of the total turnover volume. The three most active stocks- Transnational Corporation of Nigeria (Transcorp), Living Trust Mortgage Bank Plc and Japaul Gold and Ventures Plc accounted for 1.582 billion shares worth N1.564 billion in 2,726 deals, representing 36.9 per cent and 6.02 per cent of the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. Total turnover for the week stood at 4.288 billion shares worth N25.989 billion in 32,849 deals as against a total of 3.447 billion shares valued at N32.725 billion traded in 30,327 deals two weeks ago. The financial services sector however remained atop activity chart with 2.607 billion shares valued at N12.454 billion traded in 15,128 deals; thus contributing 60.81 per cent and 47.92 per cent of the total equity turnover volume and value. The conglomerates sector followed with 813.813 million shares worth N1.561 billion in 2,417 deals while oil and gas sector placed third with a turnover of 212.126 million shares worth N821.978 million in 2,726 deals. Benchmark pricing indices showed marginal depreciation during the week, driven largely by losses in the highly influential banking and industrial goods sectors. The All Share Index (ASI)- a value-based common index that tracks all share prices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) showed average decline of 0.42 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N81 billion. The ASI closed weekend at 41,001.99 points as against its opening index of 41,176.14 points for the week. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities rose from the week’s opening value of N21.530 trillion to close at N21.449 trillion. This moderated the average year-to-date return so far this year to 1.82 per cent. Many analysts, however, remained optimistic on positive pricing trend as investors take positions ahead of the release of the audited report and accounts and dividends for the 2020 business year. Analysts at Cordros Group said they expected investors’ attention to be centered on the outcome of the first Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of the year. “We believe consensus expectation for a HOLD decision if confirmed will engender positive market performance as investors cherry-pick stocks with attractive dividend yields amid negative real returns in the fixed income market. However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the fragility of the macroeconomic environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros stated. Pricing trend analysis showed widespread profit-taking transactions across the sectors with all sectoral indices closing negative. The NSE Banking Index led with a drop of 1.33 per cent. The NSE Insurance Index declined by 0.80 per cent. The NSE Industrial Goods Index dipped by 0.51 per cent. The NSE Consumer Goods Index depreciated by 0.09 per cent while the NSE Oil & Gas Index slipped by 0.13 per cent. “In the coming week, we anticipate a positive performance as investors seek bargain hunting opportunities,” Afrinvest Securities stated in a preview of trading for this week. With more advancers than decliners, the negative price performance last week was driven mainly by losses recorded by large-cap stocks. There were 53 gainers against 29 losers last week as against 60 gainers and 19 losers recorded in the previous week. Champion Breweries recorded the highest gain, in percentage term, of 44.4 per cent to close at N1.95. Trans Nationwide Express followed with a gain of 37.5 per cent to close at N1.10 while NCR Nigeria added 32.2 per cent to close at N3.12. On the negative side, Japaul led the losers with a drop of 37.5 per cent to close at 95 kobo. AXA Mansard Insurance followed with a loss of 20 per cent to close at N1.28 while MRS Oil Nigeria declined by 18.55 per cent to close at N11.20 per share.
