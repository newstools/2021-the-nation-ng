 Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria (PGAN) and their European counterparts have re-opened partnership aimed at increasing the number of professional lady golfers in the country. The two part partnership is first aimed at identifying and bringing on board more professional Lady Golfers on one hand and boosting the Nigeria PGA tour on the other. The Operation Director of Nigeria PGA, Mathew Lawrence, revealed the new package in an exclusive chat with The Nation, expressing optimism that the re-union will take the Nigeria PGA and the LPGA to greater heights adding that a qualifying school will be open this January for lady golfers wishing to become professionals. “We are affiliated to the European PGA and anything they are doing they always inform us and also invite us to tournaments but you have to make your way there,” He said. “We have started promoting the ladies version which is the LPGA we have about five of them who started it and they are putting pressures on us to increase the ladies section to make it larger as part of the partnership so we have opened qualifying school this January for lady Golfers who want to be professionals,” he enthused. Lawrence who turned pro in July 1984 , regretted that most tournaments that made the Nigeria PGA tour tick in the past have gone under. He, however, revealed that the PGA was doing all it can in collaboration with some marketing firms to make the Nigeria PGA tour vibrant again.
