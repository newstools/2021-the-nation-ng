Softwork, a leading platformwhich objective is connecting employers with freelancers, has upgraded its services. The firm  uses escrow, a third party payment plan that allows for refund. The company’s re-launch   in Lagos at the weekend, gave the platform a new look and improved features. Chief Executive Officer, SoftWork, Chigozie Okwara, said the platform is the bridge between the talented and those in need of certain skills. He said: “Every individual signing up wants to work and exchange vital information in a safe and secure space. We have designed an online platform where freelancers- web designers, developers, video editors, digital marketers, graphic designers among others can meet. “We have connected over 5,000 freelancers with employers and every day, we look for ways to verify any individual who signs up on the website. The verification is more intense to avoid fraudsters posing as freelancers or employers. There is the email verification process, Identity card verification by uploading National ID cards, Passport or Driving Licence to verify your identity. Without verification, jobs cannot be applied for. It is important employers get the worth for every price paid,” he said. Okwara noted that distance was no barrier for work on Softwork, as clients can monitor every work carried out.   Since beginning operations fully in 2018, SoftWork has helped reduce the stress freelancers go through to get jobs, and helped employers get reliable services.
