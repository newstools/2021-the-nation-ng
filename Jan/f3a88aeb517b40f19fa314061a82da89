 NOLLYWOOD actress, Tolulope Oke, has opened up on her new film entitled ‘Cookies Spot.’ The University of Lagos graduate of Sociology said the story is a reflection of life while trying to project the possibilities in life. “I believe in hope and I tried to project life and its possibilities. Cookie Spot is a story of survival wherever you find yourself. There is always a means of survival.” Oke further revealed that the film’s source of inspiration is from a carwash that can turn into a big business. The film features some notable Nollywood stars that include Adejumo Lewis, Funso Adeolu, Sola Sobowale, Ayo Adesanya, Bolanle Ninalowo, Omowunmi Dada, and a host of others. On the message of the film, Oke said, “I believe every woman has a staying power that should confront every challenge and overcome. I want every woman out there to have a positive spirit that will make them overcome in life. Young women should see the bigger picture of whatever they are doing. Possibilities are endless in life. Whatever you are doing, you should not give up. You can always be a better person wherever you are. You should learn to survive in a way that will add value to others.” On her achievement with the film, Oke said, “I want to showcase myself as a very detailed producer and actor. I also want to let the audience especially the younger ones know that there are opportunities around them. They need to identify such opportunities and deploy creativity to promote themselves. It is also to promote entrepreneurship. It also tells the youth audience that success takes perseverance. It also teaches hope. I want the younger generations to believe in their potentials and have their potentials. Success is a destination, not a journey.”
