The National Youth Service Corps has said only prospective corps members whose COVID-19 test results are negative would be allowed to register at the orientation camps. The scheme will commence its three weeks orientation course for 2020 Batch B Stream II Prospective Corps Members next week Tuesday. The NYSC warned the corps members to adhere strictly to all the COVID-19 safety protocols, saying that the scheme would not hesitate to decamp anyone who fails to adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols in camp. The Director-General of NYSC, Brig Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, who stated these during a sensitisation webinar, jointly organised by the NYSC and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for the prospective corps members ahead of commencement of the orientation exercise, warned against night journey as they (corps members) prepare to proceed to the various NYSC camps across the country for orientation programme. The DG, in a statement by the Director, Press and Public Relations of the NYSC, Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi, urged the prospective corps members to avoid actions that can put their lives at risk. “Please don’t travel at night and don’t endanger your security. Kindly stay safe. If you are sick, let us know and don’t jeopardize the orientation course,” she said.
