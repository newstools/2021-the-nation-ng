Victor Osimhen’s long-awaited return to action for Napoli remains doubtful with words rife that he might not be available for the crunch the Super Cup match against Juventus on January 20. Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli reported that there is no good news on Osimhen as the Nigerian would not be back soon due to a shoulder injury, which he had suffered since November 13. The report claimed that Osimhen has had some problems post-injury and especially after the therapies and at this moment he continues to feel a strong discomfort. Though the  recovery times are not yet clear, Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli said  it could take a few more weeks, adding beyond the injury, Osimhen will  have to recover from COVID-19 trauma after  the player tested positive following a trio to Nigeria during the Yuletide. In the same vein, Repubblica on Monday  reported the Nigeria international striker would be subjected to a new COVID-19 test and would only return  immediately  to training if he return a negative result. Meanwhile, Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has thrown his weight behind Osimhen, while backing him to bounce back. Osimhen, who lost his father last year, turned 22 in December and was allowed by his club boss to travel back to Nigeria and spend the time with his family. “You know Victor, he is young, he is very humble,” Rohr told ESPN.“This was for him a mistake, but he will learn, and he will be strong after.” “When you have a good player, who is very humble and he makes a mistake, you try to help him. Also, the coach (Gattuso) respects him, that is why he will speak to him to help him,” Rohr said.
