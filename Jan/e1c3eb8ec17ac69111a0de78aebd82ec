 The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has stated the membership registration, revalidation and update exercise remains on course and commences as scheduled on Monday, January 25, 2021. A terse statement by the Secretary Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator James AkpanUdoedehe, said any counter statement on the exercise was fake and “highly mischievous”.
The statement reads: “A “NOTICE” in circulation and ascribed to the APC CECPC National Secretary, Sen. John J. AkpanUdoedeghe Ph.D. is fake and highly mischievous.  “The APC membership registration, revalidation and update exercise remains on course and commences as scheduled in the attached timetable.” AkpanUdoedeghe had announced the CECPC has approved the constitution of State Membership Registration Committees for the Party’s nationwide membership registration, revalidation and update exercise. This will be followed by a train-the-trainer workshop.
