 THE Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) generated N85 million in 2020 for the Federal Government through service charges in Rivers State. SON also vowed to beam its searchlight on the petroleum industry to ensure maintenance of global standards in the sector. The state’s SON stated this when the Director-General and Chief Executive of the organisation, Mallam Faruk Salim, visited the Rivers/Bayelsa State Office on Port Harcourt, Port and Boarder Operations, Onne. The Coordinator,  Samuel Ayuba,  in charge of SON in the two states, said despite the challenge posed on their operations by the dreaded COVID-19 that the organisation  was able to generate about N85million. Ayuba said: “Within the year 2020, we generated N85million despite the COVID-19 pandemic. This is against the performance of N19million generated in 2019. “We are requesting that the National office support our operations with LGP testing van. This will help our operations and increase of revenue generation.‘’
