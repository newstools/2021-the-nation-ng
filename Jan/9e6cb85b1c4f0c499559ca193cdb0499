 A FALSE pregnancy claim was what saved a woman from being raped by kidnappers, a man told journalists on Monday in Akure, the Ondo State capital. Mr. Gbenga Ibikunle, his wife and three children were returning from Ebonyi State when the kidnappers swooped on them, took him and his wife into the bushes and locked up the children in their car. He dismissed police claims that they were rescued. “I am surprised by the claims that we were rescued by the police. This is nothing but a lie. I can say it boldly that no security agency came to our rescue. We were released around 1am after ransom was paid to them. “They collected the ransom along the road without being jittery. In fact, they counted all the money before they released me to my brother, who brought the N2 million. “We were in the bush with them for three good days without food. They treated us like criminals, beating us with sticks and cutlasses. We met a man in their den, who was also released the same way we were. His own family parted with N10 million before he was released. “At a point they wanted to rape my wife, but she tricked them that she was pregnant.” The kidnappers carried out their operations with impunity. They boasted that they will kill any policeman who wanted to rescue us.”
