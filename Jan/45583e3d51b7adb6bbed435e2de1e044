Jigawa Golden Stars forward Abdullahi Musa Lala said the team’s target in the on-going Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) campaign is to finish in the top four. The Dutse-based outfit won their first league game against Sunshine Stars by 1-0 but lost their second game against Dakkada FC 2-1 last Sunday in Uyo to stand in seventh place on the log. Yet Lala said the team has all it takes to compete among the big clubs in the NPFL, stressing he and his colleagues are poised to secure a continental ticket. “My expectations this season is to be in the top four; so that we can be among the clubs that will played in the CAF competitions next season,” Lala said. The former YSFON product has in the meantime, set sight on registering his name on the scorer’s sheet when Jigawa host Rangers International on Matchday three on Sunday at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium. “We just want to take that points and I hope to be one of the goal scorers for my team by God’s grace,” he affirmed. “Yeah! It’s not been easy playing without fans because they are the one to boost our moral,” he said.
