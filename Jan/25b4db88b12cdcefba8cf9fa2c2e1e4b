 NIGERIAN Union of Teachers (NUT) in Edo State has directed primary school teachers and school heads to embark on indefinite strike starting January 18. The directive was contained in a communiqué issued at the end of its enlarged State Wing Executive Council (SWEC) meeting in Benin. It was signed by Chairman Pius Okhueleigbe, Assistant Secretary-General Mike Itua, and three others. The union said its decision to embark on strike was because of the state’s failure to meet its 10-point demands. It added that the strike followed the expiration of the 21-day and 14-day ultimatums earlier given to the Godwin Obaseki-led government. The communiqué reads: “All public primary school-heads and teachers in the 18 local government areas should embark on indefinite strike from 12am of January 18. They must ensure all teaching and learning tools in their possession are put in off-mode.” Some of NUT’s demands include payment of the 2013 to 2015 promotion arrears of teachers in Oredo, Orhionmwon and Uhunmwode councils. Others are reinforcement and guaranteeing of the payment of primary school teachers’ monthly salaries, on or before the 27th of every month, correct implementation of the 30 per cent special allowance for teachers of challenged children and all arrears paid, among others.
