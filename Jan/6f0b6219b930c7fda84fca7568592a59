 THE All Progressives Congress (APC) has won the 484 councillorship and 44 chairmanship seats in Kano State at the council polls held on Saturday. Though the election witnessed low turnout, it was adjudged as “peaceful.” Security was tight in all the polling units, as the people cast their ballots. Out of the 18 registered political parties in the state, only 12 fielded candidates and participated in the council election. Kano State Independent Electoral Commission (KANSIEC) Chairman, Prof. Garba Ibrahim Sheka said winners of the election will be issued with their certificates today. Prof Sheka, in a press conference yesterday said, out of five million registered voters 2,350,577 electorate voted. The KANSIEC boss hailed Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje for not interfering in the election. “I am happy that nobody, not even a chicken, was feared dead in the election. At least, the election was 89 per cent successful,” Sheka said. He also appreciated the efforts of security agencies, who he said: “were everywhere to ensure voters maintained law and order.” Governor Ganduje, who voted in his Ward 008 ward, of Dawakin Kudu local area, expressed delight about the peaceful conduct of the election. “I am impressed by how people came out to vote peacefully. It showed the election has been accepted by all the people of Kano State. “And this gives us confidence, especially as we don’t believe in a caretaker committee to be managing the local government councils. Thus, we must have elected officials to manage the affairs of our 44 local government areas. “This election, therefore, serves as the end of tenure for those who were elected three years ago. “People were orderly, as they voted. There was no intimidation or harassment of anybody and they voted the candidates of their choices,” the governor said. Prof. Sheka said the commission will improve on its “minor” shortcomings in next elections.
