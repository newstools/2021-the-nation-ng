 A LAW firm, Monye, Monye & Co, on Sunday criticized  a former Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Vice President Monday Ubani’s claim that an engineer, Abiodun Ariori, acted illegally on the recovering of a landed property in Ikeja,  Lagos. The firm’s principal partner, Monyr Francis, said the property, No 1, Foluronsho Kuku Street, off Opebi Village, Ikeja, belonged to the G.W. O Meadows Family, who hired his client, Ariori, to help them develop it. Ubani had claimed in a Facebook post on December 31 that Ariori procured land grabbers and officials of Lagos State Government, who illegally invaded and forcibly occupied Monkey Village and demolished residents’ houses. But in a statement on Sunday, Francis described Ubani’s claims as “wild accusations, conjectures and alternative facts”. He said: “Our client was contracted by the G.W. O Meadows Family to help in the development of property now known as 1, Foluronsho Kuku Street, Off Opebi Village, Ikeja Lagos State. “Upon the conclusion of the terms of engagement, our client discovered that he could not take possession of the land immediately and he reported the incident to the Solicitor of the Meadows Jimoh Momoh Esq of Milan Solicitors, who reported the incident to the Lagos State Special Taskforce on Land Grabbers (LSSTF/LG) vide a petition dated the 5th March, 2020 in respect of the activities of Mrs. Ilori and other Occupiers of the land. “After the submission of the Petition, the LSSTF/LG being the statutory body established by the Lagos State Government conducted an investigation in other to determine the merit of the petition.”
