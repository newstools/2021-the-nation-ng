SIR: Finally, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the retirement of his service chiefs and appointed new ones. Although, their retirement was long overdue, the president’s action has elicited applause from Nigerians and security experts who blame the rise of insecurity on the inability of the outgoing service chiefs to effectively move against the dreaded Boko Haram and armed bandits who continue to terrorise the country. The outgone service chiefs deserve a pat on their back. They have done their best to see the country fully secured and protected. But they were apparently overwhelmed by numerous security challenges. The resurrection of the decimated Boko Haram members and bandits who overran many villages in Borno, Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna states points their weakness. Though, the police and other paramilitary agencies such as Nigerian Civil Defence Corps are primarily and constitutional empowered to provide internal security duties, the gravity of insecurity in the country is beyond their capability hence the deployment of military to complement their roles. With the new service chiefs on board, what should Nigerians expect from them? The new service chiefs have come at a time when the country is facing serious security challenges. There is menace of armed bandits, remnants of Boko Haram who have regrouped and the emergence of ethnic militias. The new service chiefs are not new in the war field. They have carved niches for themselves, recorded successes in their previous assignments. One prays they will replicate it and put more efforts to arrest prevailing insecurity threatening the peace, unity and survival of the country.
