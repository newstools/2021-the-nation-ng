A military task force, Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), operating in Plateau State, has denied killing two youths in Riyom Local Government Area of the State. The victims identified as Jerry Bitrus, 28, and Joseph Davou, 32, were reportedly killed last Sunday by gunmen in the area. Locals had accused personnel of the military outfit of complicity in the killing,  which has drawn condemnation  from citizens and politicians in the state. But reacting to the allegation, OPSH insisted that it had nothing to do with the  death of the youths, explaining that rather its personnel on patrol were drafted to the area on receipt of a distress call about the incident. In a statement signed by its media officer, Major Ibrahim Shittu, the OPSH said: “To set the records straight, we wish to state that on Sunday,January 10,2021, the Commander Sector 6 of Riyom General Area was called by the youth leader of Ghoss to inform him that two  persons were shot by unknown gunmen. “Following the information, he swiftly mobilised his troops in conjunction with the Police Riyom Division to the scene. On their arrival, they met the two victims who were incapacitated and bleeding profusely. A close examination by the team showed that one was already dead while the other one was evacuated to K Vom Christian Hospital in company of some youths;  unfortunately, he later gave up the ghost. “Members of the general public are therefore advised to discountenance the false and baseless allegations.”
