Senator Aishatu Binani (Adamawa Central), in conjunction with the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), has trained 385 persons in her constituency. The senator also followed up the training by empowering the trainees with start-up kits. The beneficiaries were trained in 16 trades – Computer Appreciation (154); Tailoring (56); Hairdressing (36); Alluminium Fabrication (31); Satellite Installation (23), among others. They received their free professional kits at the weekend in Yola. Binani said the kits, ‘coming after an intensive training’, would assist the people to be self-reliant. She said: “It is our hope that we will continue to attract more of the interventions to our people through the constituency projects intended for the benefit of our people.” Goodness Haruna, who got hairdressing kit, was excited that she now has a power generator in addition to the basic requirements of a functional salon. About 1,667 kits were given out at the event. All Progressives Congress (APC) National Interim Caretaker Committee member representing the Northeast, Prof Tahir Maman said the intervention was the fifth of such by the senator since her election in 2019. “We thank the senator for this huge intervention. This kind comes with relief because it is complete with requisite training and the tools for practical ventures. And it is very much in line with our party’s slogans of Change and now Next Level,” he said.
