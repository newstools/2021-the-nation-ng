 The Chairperson of the Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode, at the weekend announced an additional one month postponement of the NWFL Premiership season in a frantic bid to ensure strict compliance with COVID-19 Preventive Protocols that were established before the League started on December 9, 2020. Falode, said irregularities and  discoveries made during the one-week postponement of the Week 5 matches to allow clubs carry out COVID-19 tests for all their players and officials led to the decision. She disclosed further: “Feedback from the one-week suspension to allow for COVID-19 re-testing by clubs exposed flaws in complying with the NWFL directives. After due consultations, it has been agreed that a further one-month period should be given to allow for due diligence by all the clubs and stakeholders for strict compliance. We realised that clubs were not taking enough COVID-19 protocol precautionary measures.” Meanwhile, Falode, who is also a board member of the Nigeria Football Federation declared that clubs and stakeholders should within the one month period meet the following requirements including: “Mandatory COVID-19 tests to be carried out at government-approved centres and hospitals. These tests must be sustained when the League resumes. “The full results of the tests, indicating where they were conducted should be forwarded to the NWFL secretariat in Abuja. “Results that are not from government – approved centres and hospitals will not be accepted and the affected clubs risk being suspended from the league,” she noted.
