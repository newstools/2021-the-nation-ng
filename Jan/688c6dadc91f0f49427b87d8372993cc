 The sudden reign of facemask in Nigeria and globally has been as a result of the outbreak of coronavirus, which has led to the loss of  many lives. Notwithstanding, coronavirus in Nigeria is not to be compared with other countries having thousands of cases on a daily basis. Yet, ours seems not to come to an end, as we expect a second phase of lockdown at a period of border re-opening. Facemask, perhaps, could help in preventing the virus. Meanwhile, caution must be exercised in  using it. Healthwise, on its removal, one is expected not to use bare hands to touch the outermost part of the facemask covering the nose and mouth.It should  be removed  gently  and disposed or burnt immediately. One is not expected to pull it down  to the jaw to sneeze, talk or eat. By doing this, one is bound to contaminate the neck or any part of the body. The way and manner the facemask is being used matters.  Some  are to  be disposed immediately after use.  Re-usable facemask should also be taken off with care and thoroughly  washed  with hot water. Afterwards, hands must be washed with detergent and followed with a hand sanitiser. We must note that not all facemasks serve as virus prevention. For instance, the surgical  facemask is not likely to prevent the virus. However, when  facemask is  worn appropriately, it could help prevent other diseases. It is important to check the facemask before use to ensure no defects such as a tear, missing tie or ear loop. Likewise, one is expected not to touch the inside of the mask (the part over nose and mouth). It may be contaminated from breathing, coughing  or sneezing.
