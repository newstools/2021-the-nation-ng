One person has been confirmed as a result of an explosion at Imo Oil Palm Plantation otherwise known as Adapalm Nigeria Limited in Ohaji, Imo state during palm oil production processes in the company. At least five other workers were injured in the explosion at the factory. The company’s General Manager, Goddy Esomobodo, disclosed this to newsmen in Owerri while reacting to the rumour that seven persons died in what he called industrial mishap. The incident, which took place last week, caused pandemonium in the host community situated in Ohaji/Egbema council area of the state, as residents scrambled for safety and have been living in fear over reoccurrence. Obodo stated ever since the incident happened, the company had engaged engineers who have been working assiduously towards finding a lasting solution to any form of the ugly development. Explaining how the incident happened, Obodo said: “An industrial accident took place in Adapalm, last week Thursday afternoon. When the door of the sterilizer was forced open by pressure while fruit cooking was going on, leading to explosion that wounded five persons. “The Adapalm management quickly rushed the victims to St. Anthony Hospital, Amafor near the factory for first aid and later moved them to FMC, Owerri. The patients are responding to treatment but, one just gave up this morning.” Obodo, who described the incident as a shock, sympathised with the victims and their families over the ugly incident involving human life, adding “it is not as a result of human error, rather a natural disaster.” He said: “Engineers are working round the clock to ascertain the cause of the industrial mishap with a view to finding a lasting solution.”
