An employee of Shoprite in Akure, Ondo State, Jumoke Kehinde, has allegedly committed suicide after being suspended. She was said to have been found dead on New Year eve in her home at Kajola, on Oda Road, Akure. A worker at Shoprite, who pleaded anonymity, said the deceased reported late for work and she was suspended. According to the employee, “it is normal that anyone who comes late should wait outside before they are allowed in and be suspended. “She was seen arranging her table, getting ready for the day’s sales as she looked happy. But she later left the mall about 11am after receiving the suspension letter. “About 4pm, a distress call was received in the office that she was not feeling fine. One of the management officials went to check her. Kehinde was found on the floor of her room shaking, while her body was oozing with Snipper odour. Although, no empty can of the item was found anywhere, as she was rushed to hospital. “After some time at the hospital, she was declared dead. One of her relatives said she did not show any sign of depression. “She was suspended for coming late. She was told to go home. After then she went back home. “We all know that when you come late, you will be suspended for a few days without payment. “I don’t see any reason such issue would make her to commit suicide.” Police spokesman ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro could not be reached for comments, but sources said her body had been deposited at a morgue, while investigation had begun. The management of Shoprite in Akure has declined to comment on the issues surrounding the death of Kehinde. Contacted for comments, a management official, who preferred anonymity, said they were not allowed to speak to the press. “Go to our head office. We are not allowed to respond to such interrogations from reporters.”
