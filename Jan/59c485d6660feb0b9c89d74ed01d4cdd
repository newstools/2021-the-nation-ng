The South East South South Professionals of Nigeria (SESSPN) has lamented death of Admiral Ndubuisi Kalu, Prof Nick Idoko, Ziggy Azike and Oscar Onwudiwe. A statement by the group’s spokesman Collins Steve Ugwu described their death as an unkind cut on their icons of integrity. It also hailed the new leader of Ohanaeze. The statement reads: “Admiral Ndubuisi Kalu was a master of his military career with historic gallantry at Nigeria’s democratic persistence, Prof Idoko was an invaluable knowledge asset who deployed it to lead, mentor and nurture many. “Ziggy Azike and Oscar Onwudiwe were exceptional portraits of leadership talents with depths of legal reserves that were unexhausted and untimely denied a nation that deserves more of them. “These losses are indeed sad with a cumulative waste of human capital that is tragic to the nation and hurts their families intensely. We deeply mourn them with their families, their states and their governors.” On Onanaeze’s leader, it said: “We congratulate the new Ohaneze Ndigbo President-General, Prof George Obiozor whom they noted is not just an accomplished professional, but an astute diplomat with quick expectations from the nationality he now leads for results that he cannot defer but build upon. “We sincerely wish him well and look forward to a fresh synergy that will impact our subregions positively to induce peace and security for our robust regional growth and development.”
