The Cross River Government security outfit “Operation Akpakwu”, has demolished four houses at 8-Miles area in Calabar owned by suspected kidnappers. The team also demolished a brothel close to the popular Flour Mill Junction in Calabar for allegedly harbouring criminals and consumers of illicit drugs. Speaking after the exercise on Monday, Mr Henry Okokon, the State Security Adviser (Southern Senatorial District) to Governor Ben Ayade, said the demolition was one of the ways of chasing criminals out of the state. “This is part of the activities of Operation Akpakwu, a special force set up by Governor Ayade to fight crime in the state, especially kidnapping,” he said. “This demolition exercise is ongoing. The governor has warned that anyone who is involved in any form of criminality, or any landlord who is found harbouring any criminal, should desist from it. These houses belong to individuals who have been caught in the act of kidnapping in the state. “The brothel was also brought down because the management of the facility was also harbouring criminals and drug addicts. This is a warning signal to everybody. Whosoever is involved in crime of any form should desist from it,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Operation Akpakwu is made up of security personnel drawn from the Navy, Air Force, Army, Police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps.
