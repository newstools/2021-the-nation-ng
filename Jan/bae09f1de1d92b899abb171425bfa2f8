 WILLIAMS Troost –Ekong finished second in the poll for the Watford’s Player of the Month Award for December 2020. Kiko Femenía beat the Nigerian to the Player of the Month for December, after picking up the prize for the second month running. The full-back earned 58 per cent of the vote for the award, beating Troost-Ekong (22 per cent) and Troy Deeney (20 per cent). Watford were unbeaten when Femenía started in December, with three wins and two draws, and the team conceded only once when the 29-year-old was on the pitch.
