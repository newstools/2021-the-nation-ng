 WHEN you step into a place, the first thing you crave is to be noticed.  That happens when your fabric, design as well as the accessories compliment your overall outlook. The year has taken off and the fashion scene is staging a big comeback after the fallout from COVID-19 last year. Our designers are back at it with haute couture at the centre of it all. You find a mix of conventional and non-conventional fabrics used for churning out pieces that steal the show anytime. Exclusive pieces are fabulous for formal events. At a recent event,  seasoned designer, Princess Kelechi Oghene of the GMYT Fashion Academy  and her team stormed the Eventistry, Lekki Lagos  with runway exclusives  depicting  what to expect this year . The collection projected contemporary formal wears,  bold and bright colours,  necklines that were really appealing  as well as dramatic sleeves  on models who made it all magnetic.
