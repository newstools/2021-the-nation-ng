Two time champions league winners Enyimba will face either Bloem Celtic of South Africa or compatriots Rivers United in the Confederation Cup playoffs. The Peoples Elephant crashed out of the Champions league after failing to turn the table against El Merreikh of Sudan in the return leg of their two legged encounter. Although the first leg of the playoffs has been fixed for Valentineâ€™s Day February 14 according to the draw released by Confederation of African Football on Friday, uncertainty still hangs over the Nigerian tie as the second leg of the Confederation cup match between Rivers United and Bloem Celtic has not been decided. The tie originally scheduled for Wednesday last week was put on hold after Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said the South African team will not be granted entry because of the ravaging effect of Covid-19 now in its second phase globally. The second leg of the playoffs will be played on the 21st February. Draw for the CAF Champions league were also held Friday with Egyptian giants Al Ahly in quest for their 10th continental title pitched against AS Vita Club of Congo, Simba of Tanzania and Enyimba conquerors El Merreikh of Sudan in Group A.
