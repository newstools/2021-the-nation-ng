Oladapo Afolayan marked his West Ham debut with a goal as the Hammers crushed into the FA Cup fifth round with a thumping win over Doncaster Rovers. The 23-year-oldâ€™s goal soon after his introduction as a substitute capped a 4-0 win, in a game that West Ham dominated from the moment Pablo Fornals opened the scoring inside two minutes. Andriy Yarmolenko doubled the lead on the half-hour mark before an own goal from Andy Butler all-but ended the game as a contest after the break. The win sets up a last-16 meeting with one of Manchester United or Liverpool for the Hammers, who have now won their last five matches. Moyes made eight changes from the victory against West Brom with midweek matchwinner Michail Antonio and the only forward at the club one of several to drop to the bench.
