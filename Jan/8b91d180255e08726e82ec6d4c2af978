The Assistant Inspector General of Police, Zone 2 headquarters, Onikan, Lagos state, Ahmed Iliyasu has called for a sustained collaboration between the police and the community. This, according to him will ultimately lead to a drastic reduction in crime and other social disorders in the neighbourhood. He made the call at the commissioning of new and renovated office buildings, recreation and conference halls and premises of the Area ‘B’ Command Apapa, Lagos Command. He noted that government and police alone cannot solve all security challenges, hence the need for effective collaboration. “The new look, Area ‘B’ Command, today is the result of the collaboration, innovation and ingenuity of the Area Commander, ACP Olatunji Akinbayo and the good people of Apapa. While officers must have thorough understanding of community needs, they must also lay emphasis on treating the community with respect, just, fairness and equity. Involvement of key community members in policing the community requires reciprocity and foundation of trust and mutual responsiveness. It is my prayer that the trust and bond between police and community that yielded this outstanding result in Apapa today will be replicated in other part of Lagos state and Nigeria,” he said.
