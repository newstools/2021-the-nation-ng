Following the suspension of the nine-month industrial strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), the Senate of the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) has approved the resumption of academic activities for the Rain Semester from Monday, January 11, 2021. At its 285th Emergency Meeting held virtually via Zoom Thursday last week, the Senate decided that lectures will hold online in line with the directive of the National Universities Commission (NUC). The resumption of academic activities followed the Senate’s approval of proposals by the Committee of Provost and Deans in their meeting held December 30, 2020. Other resolutions of the meeting were:*No student will be accommodated on campus for now; there would be 13 weeks of lectures; there will be three weeks of Rain Semester Examinations; There will be only two weeks for marking and computations of results; training of staff for virtual learning would hold January 4 – 8; practical classes will commence after COVID-19 break. At the University of Lagos (UNILAG), the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe said a resumption date for the institution would be announced after the Senate meets in a few weeks. “We like following due process.  We cannot announce resumption without (the) Senate meeting.  So we are going to have senate meeting very soon.  We have come up with a proposal which we are going to take to senate meeting for approval.  So very soon we are going to make announcement in that area. They should be expecting our report in the next two weeks or three weeks maximum,” Ogundipe said in an interview.
