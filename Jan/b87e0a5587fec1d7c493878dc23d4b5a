  Osun State House of Assembly Minority Leader Adewunmi Babatunde yesterday accused Speaker Timothy Owoeye of maltreatment and marginalising other lawmakers from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He alleged that Owoeye had relegated PDP lawmakers, refusing to attend to the motion raised by them. A statement by the legislator said he was at a point denied access to a meeting of principal officers in the House because of his party. Babatunde said: “When Governor Adegboyega Oyetola signed the 2021 Appropriation Bill into Law, after the usual ceremony and the governor had appended his signature, there was need for principal officers to meet the governor and talk, but I was turned back. The reason given to me was that only principal officers from the All Progressives Congress (APC) are allowed.” Reacting to the allegations, the Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker, Mr. Kunle Alabi, said: “The minority leader as a first-timer is still learning and will soon understand to the fullest the procedures of law making. The 7th Assembly under the leadership of Owoeye will be more committed to training and retraining in the new year for efficiency and proper understanding of legislative processes.”
