Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO), Anambra state chapter on Wednesday appealed to political gladiators and parties in the State to educate their overzealous supporters to eschew politics of bitterness and playing according to the rules of the game. Chairman of the group, Comrade Vincent Ezekwueme made the call on Wednesday in reaction to the release by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the state governorship election fixed for November 6, 2021. He also called on party leaders to shun campaign of calumny, character assassination and casting aspersions on opponents which he described as a threat to democracy. He said, “We appeal to political gladiators and parties in Anambra State to educate theirs overzealous supporters, praise singers and sycophants on the inevitable and indispensable need to play the game of politics according to the rules. “We decry with great disdain campaign of calumny, character assassination, casting unsubstantiated aspersions on the opponents which is not only unfortunate but a threat to our democracy.” Ezekwueme further appealed to political parties to zone their governorship candidates from Anambra south for the interest of equity, social justice and morality to reduce political tension. “The panacea over the current political tension in the state is for all political parties to adhere strictly to the wisest decision of former governor, Peter Obi in formulating zoning arrangement that ceded power to Anambra North. “Political parties should conduct free, fair and credible primary elections. Political, religious and Civil Society Organisations should mobilize citizens for active participation in the fast-approaching voters’ registration,” he added.
