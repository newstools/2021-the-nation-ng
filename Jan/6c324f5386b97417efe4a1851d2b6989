 Italian football giants, AS Roma, have begun its youth football academy operations in Abuja, Nigeria. UEFA licensed Coaches, Portuguese Andre Joao Castro from Lisbon (Level 1 in Talent identification) and Italian Giovanni Musumeci are expected to take charge of proceedings during the trials, with the sole aim of discovering and nurturing talents in the football-crazy country. The Italian giants partnered Abuja-based  Garden City Panthers with the aim of producing a steady stream of elite players with strong links to the Serie A club. AS Roma operates one of the premier academy development programs in the world. Through this relationship, coaches will gain insights into best practices gained through decades of top-level development experience, and that’s information and expertise that will be passed directly on to discovered players. The initiative will see the academy focus on giving opportunities to boys and girls with great football talents from ages 5-17. Registration is ongoing while trials with the Academy will begin between January 7 and 9  in three centres across in  Abuja including Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja; New Capital School, Asokoro and Guards Brigade Aguiyi Ironsi Cantonment. Plans are also underway to set up the AS Roma Academy in other cities outside Abuja like Port Harcourt, Yenagoa, Benin and Lagos.
