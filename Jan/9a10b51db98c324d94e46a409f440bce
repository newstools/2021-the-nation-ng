 GOMBE State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya on Thursday called on the state chapter of the Nigerian Legion to fully mobilise its members as a reserve force to assist towards tackling security challenges in their respective local government areas. Governor Yahaya stated this at the official launch of the 2020/2021 Armed Forces Remembrance Day and Emblem Appeal Fund held at the New Banquet  Hall of the Government House. He said the event afforded the government and people of the state the opportunity to reflect on the contributions made by members of the armed forces in and out of service and to provide succour to members of their families. He said the occasion was not only for the remembrance of fallen heroes but also an opportunity to address the predicament of their dependents and loved ones. “This appeal fund is meant to generate resources to support families and loved ones of our fallen heroes and retired servicemen. I appeal to good-spirited individuals as well as public and private organisations to donate generously to the Emblem Appeal Fund,” he said. The governor said having listened to the address of the Chairman, Nigerian Legion Gombe State chapter, his administration will look into the requests with a view to addressing them. Governor Yahaya launched the 2020/2021 Appeal Fund with N5 million as government’s donation and N1 million as his personal contribution. The Commissioner of Internal Security and Ethical Orientation, Mr Dauda Batari Zambuk noted that “it is a fact that members of the Nigerian armed forces have made supreme sacrifices to ensure that the country remains one.”
