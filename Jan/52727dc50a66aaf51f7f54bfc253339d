The University of Lagos (UNILAG) has directed that its Staff Club should be closed to guard against the spread of COVID-19. Its vice chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, who gave the directive that the club should be close with immediate effect, said: “The directive is necessitated to curb the spread of COVID-19 as a result of a second wave of the pandemic.” When asked if the closure was as a result of detected COVID-19 cases on the university campus, Ogundipe stated in message to The Nation that the closure was in compliance with the Lagos State Government’s directive that social clubs should not operate for now. “It’s just to obey the directive from the government about the closure of club houses,” he said.
