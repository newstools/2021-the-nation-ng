The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad has urged judicial officers in the country not to betray their oath of office for any reason. “The oath you have taken is a covenant between you and the Almighty God. I urge you to hold tenaciously to it and never be tempted to violate or desecrate any fraction of it. “As we all know, even the cloudiest areas of our hearts and thoughts, God sees through. We can’t afford to pretend about our intentions,” he said. Justice Muhammad spoke in Abuja on Wednesday while inaugurating Justice Salisu Garba as the Chief of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The CJN, who described Justice Garba as an experienced and dedicated judicial officer, urged him not to betray the confidence reposed in him. He added: “The times that we are in, are quite perilous, so we must gird our loins to give our best in every task given to us with a view to moving our nation forward. “We must not rest on oars if we are truly desirous of attaining new heights and conquering seemingly difficult situations. As the head of the FCT Judiciary, we expect nothing short of the best from you. The buck stops at your desk and you must always be honest enough to be dispassionate In handling all issues before you. “As the acting Chief Judge of the FCT, you are carrying a lot of responsibilities on your shoulders. “If, for instance, you were working 14 hours per day before, you have to double it to meet up with the demands of your new office. “I have long known you as an astute and dexterous judicial officer, so I have no doubt that you will rise up to the occasion and give a sterling account of yourself at the end of your stewardship.”
