Two persons were feared killed during clashes between suspected cultists at Coker-Aguda Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos. The Nation learnt one of the deceased was lured out on Saturday night from his Aguda residence before he was killed by rival cult members. Shortly after he was gunned down, his members came out to torment residents of the area. The entire stretch of Enitan, Willy Omiyi, Akinyele and Adetola streets in the area had sleepless night till Sunday morning. The suspected cultists were said to have gone on a shooting spree, leaving residents scampering for safety. On Sunday morning, the Aguda faction was reported to have gone to Ijesha for a reprisal attack, killing one person. An eyewitness told The Nation that the Ijesha faction came to Aguda around 10am to confront their rivals. Residents of the communities appealed to the state Government to beam search light on growing rival cult clashes in the area. They urged Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu to launch a manhunt for members of the rival cult groups. They also urged the Coker-Aguda Local LCDA to ensure that the street lights in the area are always powered to expose people perpetrating evil under the guise of darkness. Coker-Aguda Local LCDA Chairman Mrs. Omobolanle Akinyemi-Obe, told The Nation that the perpetrators of the violence act have been arrested by the police. “The security operatives have restored normalcy to the area. A lot of those boys causing mayhem have been arrested. I have repeated it that the council will not tolerate acts of violence and deviant behaviour. We will go after the perpetrators and prosecute them,” she said. A resident confirmed to The Nation that normalcy has returned. According to him, Police officers have been stationed at Pako, a hotbed between Ijesha and Aguda where the feud occurred.
