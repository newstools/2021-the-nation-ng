 MATCH hero of Leicester City’s triumph over Brentford in their last confrontation in the Emirates FA Cup last season, Kelechi Iheanacho expects a tougher atmosphere at the Brentford Community Stadium when they clash again in the fourth round of the same competition today. Iheanacho calls on his teammates to take their chances against obviously improved Brentford as they chase down their first FA Cup title. “We played them last time in the FA Cup and probably the team has changed a little bit,” Iheanacho told LCFC TV via video call. “They were a good side last time we played them, and they have good quality players as well, so they might hurt us if we’re not careful. We need to just be ourselves, play our own game and make sure that we get the win. “We need to take our chances when they come in the first half, so they don’t take us to the second half. “They’re at home, and sometimes when you don’t take your chances, it gets hard in the second half. You have to cope with it, so we need to take our chances when they come.” Nigeria international Iheanacho rounded off a brilliant move in last term’s win at Brentford, converting James Justin’s cross after a sensational pass from Dennis Praet found City’s dynamic full-back. “Of course, it’s a good memory,” the striker continued. “We won that game and we went through, and I scored. I have to mention that great pass from Dennis Praet. It was absolutely outstanding, that pass. Iheanacho has played 18 games in all competitions with three goals and four assists for the Foxes.
