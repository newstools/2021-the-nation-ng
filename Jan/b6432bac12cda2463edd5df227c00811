David Alaba’s move from Bayern Munich to Real Madrid for next season is a done deal. It is suggested that the Austria international has already undergone a medical ahead of what will be a four-year deal. The report also states that the 28-year-old will earn a €11 million-per-year salary during his time in Madrid. Clubs across Europe having been eyeing the Bayern man, so this will be seen as a real triumph for Los Blancos. Bayern made three offers to Alaba in the past few months, but club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is resigned to losing the defender after reportedly trying to do “everything” to get an extension done. With Sergio Ramos facing an uncertain future, Raphael Varane due for a new deal in 2022, and Eder Militao struggling since joining from FC Porto in 2019, signing a player like Alaba will ensure some proven stability in Real Madrid’s backline.
