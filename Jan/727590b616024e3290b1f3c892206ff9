 Former President Olusegun Obasanjo is a man who understands the grace of God and is thankful for that. Ushering in the New Year, Obasanjo held a thanksgiving service in Abeokuta, Ogun State, in company of the likes of Gbenga Daniels; Gov Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State; Rev. Mother Abimbola and Rev. Dr. Ademuyiwa Ajayi; Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Chairman Ogun State, Bishop Tunde Akin-Akinsanya; CAN Chairman, Lagos, Steven Adegbite; Otun Balogun of Iwoland; Chief Abiola Ogundokun; Chief Obafemi Olopade; Major General Ekundayo Opaleye, Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogunand and Iyalode Alaba Lawson. In his sermon, titled, “Thanksgiving: A Secret of God’s Champions,” Bishop Francis Wale Oke urged everyone to imbibe the habit of giving thanks to God always. “David cultivated the habit of thanking God, and that was one of the reasons he was able to defeat his enemies. For every good God has done to us, let us learn to say thank you,” he said. The event branded with praises and songs by the Ogun State CAN choir also featured a moment of prayer for youths championed by Rev. Mother Esther Ajayi.
