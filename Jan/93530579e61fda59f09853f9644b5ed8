University lecturers on Monday expressed their readiness to resume academic activities next Monday as directed by the National Universities Commission (NUC). The lecturers, however, asked the Federal Government to guarantee their health and safety and that of students amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) President, Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, said assessments done by its branches suggested that university authorities have not done enough to ensure a safe learning environment. He said: “We have no objection to the resumption of universities. ASUU has suspended its strike and our members are ready to work. “However, the health and safety of our members as well as our students must be guaranteed. “I hope the government will work it out together with the university authorities to ensure that this second wave of COVID-19 does not affect the health and safety of the university communities. “We ask the government to do what they did in the aviation industry: let them evaluate the level of preparedness and let them tell Nigerians that with what they have seen they can guarantee that if the students return, if lecturers have classes, there will be no adverse consequences.” Many of the branches at the weekend said it was unsafe for universities to reopen.
