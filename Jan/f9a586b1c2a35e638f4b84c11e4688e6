The duo of Omoniyi Raphael popularly called Zlatan Ibile and Florence Otedola known as DJ Cuppy, has continued to make the headlines over the seemingly strained relationship. In the past few weeks, the spotlight beamed on the 28-year-old DJ ever since she alleged that Zlatan blocked her on social media. When DJ Cuppy had lamented the Zanku crooner blocked her on social-media platforms. Many thought it’s just one of those celebrity gimmicks to “create rancour” but Zlatan’s recent reaction set many tongues wagging. DJ Cuppy tweeted: “10 months later and I sometimes still wonder why @Zlatan_Ibile blocked me on WhatsApp and Instagram without ever saying why; we were actually friends…AND “Gelato” was a hit!” The duo was previously on good terms and collaborated for ‘Gelato‘, Cuppy’s 2019 hit song. The ‘Zanku’ crooner also performed at DJ Cuppy’s charity event held in Abuja in November 2019. But their friendship has since suffered setback with Zlatan recently saying that he “does not know” Cuppy. Zlatan’s statement elicited flurry of reactions. However, in a short post on Friday, Cuppy said she remains unperturbed by the seeming “noise” making the rounds on social media in the wake of her face-off with Zlatan. Afeare Israeli, a personal logistics manager to Davido, claimed that Zlatan’s action was because the disc jockey did not “duly reward” him for his contributions to the success of ‘Gelato’ and Cuppy’s charity event.
