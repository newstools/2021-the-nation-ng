Veritas University will award various degrees to 421 students tomorrow. The University will also be honouring 32 students who will be graduating with First-Class in the 2019/2020 academic session. Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof. Hyacinth Ichoku revealed this during a briefing ahead of the 9th convocation ceremony of the University. Ichoku said the university had to migrate its academic activities online because of the outbreak of COVID-19 which resulted in the closure of universities last year. He said the ICT Department of the University was able to develop a robust platform that enabled the students to continue their academic activities online. He said: “It has been quite a tough and turbulent year for us, just like every other person and just like every other academic institution. “We have about 421 students who will be graduating. Out of this number, 32 are graduating with first-class.”
