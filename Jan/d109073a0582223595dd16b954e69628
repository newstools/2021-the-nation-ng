The Conversation Africa (TCA), based in Bloemfontein, South Africa, is  part of The Conversation global media consortium founded and based in the United Kingdom. It is the world’s leading media organisation, which publishes research-based analyses monthly. The awards ceremony recently held virtually due to the pandemic and had in attendance founders and publishers of the journal, scholars from Africa and beyond and sub-regional editors and awardees from around Africa. In his statement,Prof. Sheriff said : “To God be the glory, The Conversation Africa has in the past one year given me more international visibility, causing global news networks in South Africa, United States and South Asia to engage me regularly in interviews. “Each time an article is published, I get interview requests from where I do not expect. The best part was an encounter I had with the CNN. I will encourage colleagues in Covenant to endeavour to contribute for TCA.”
