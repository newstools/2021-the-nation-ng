Out-of-favour Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli is optimistic he will complete a loan switch to Paris Saint-Germain this month, claims The Sun. Alli has dropped completely down the pecking order under Jose Mourinho this season and some have even criticised the Tottenham manager’s handling of the creative midfielder. PSG ran out of time to complete a season-long loan deal for Alli in the summer but have extra incentive to get a deal done this month now Mauricio Pochettino is in charge. The former Tottenham manager replaced Thomas Tuchel as PSG head coach at the start of the month and wants to reunite with Alli in Paris. Pochettino got the best out of Alli and he wants the England international to be his first signing as PSG head coach. Mourinho has previously ruled out Alli’s departure this month but the 24-year-old believes he will get the chance to leave Tottenham before the transfer window closes. Alli desperately needs regular first-team football between now and the end of the season to have any chance of making Gareth Southgate’s England squad for Euro 2020. Alli was a key player for England at the 2018 World Cup but hasn’t featured in any of their last 14 internationals dating back to the summer of 2019. He has been limited to just one start and four appearances in the Premier League all season, racking up only 75 minutes on the pitch. Mourinho has remarkably axed Alli from his matchday squad in 11 of Tottenham’s 18 Premier League matches this season.
