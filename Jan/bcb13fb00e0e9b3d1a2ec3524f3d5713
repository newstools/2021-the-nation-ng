Fans have taken to social media to react over alleged kissing affair between former housemates in the Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) reality show, Terseer Waya, aka Kiddwaya, and Kaisha Umaru. But the duo, in terse separate social media posts, denied the allegation. In the now viral video, ex-housemates were at birthday party of another Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate Praise Nelson. Kiddwaya was seen pouring alcohol in Kaisha’s mouth and making a move as if he wanted to kiss her. This promoted many social media users especially Erica fans popularly called “elites” to accuse Kaisha of attempting to steal Kiddwaya from Erica Nlewedim. While Elites repeatedly tweeted that “Erica’s name should not be dragged into the whole issue” with the hashtag #FreeErica, the scenario has set many tongues wagging. Erica and Kiddwaya became the cynosure of all eyes on numerous occasions during their stint at the 2020 edition of the reality show as a result of their relationship. Their relationship however became a heated topic since the show ended with many accusing Kiddwaya of not showing the required commitment. Kaisha took to Twitter with her official handle (@kaishaofficial_) to deny the allegation. She tweeted: “So I woke up to “Kidd kissed Kaisha last night “ How??? Oh yes I had too much to drink at Praise’s birthday party last night and I don’t remember kissing Kidd so where’s this coming from? “Kidd’s ritual of pouring drinks into our mouths is not new and we all know how playful he is. Kidd is like a brother to me and I have never imagined kissing Kidd! Never!!! It’s my fault that I was careless last night; I had too much to drink. “My carelessness pushed a Negative Narrative about Kidd and I sincerely apologize for that. For those assuming on Kidd’s behavior saying he kissed me here you go… the full video.” Also, Kiddwaya (@RealKiddWaya) tweeted on Saturday night “False story. Goodnight.”
