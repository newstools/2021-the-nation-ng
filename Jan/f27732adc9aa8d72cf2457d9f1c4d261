 SUPER Eagles defender Semi Ajayi’s place in West Bromwich’s defence is under threat as new boss Sam Allardyce prioritise strengthening his defence in the January transfer window. The Baggies have conceded 39 goals in the league this campaign – the division’s worst record – and are 19th in the Premier League – six points from safety – and have scored just 11 goals in 17 top-flight games this season. Allardyce, who replaced Slaven Bilic as the Baggies’ manager last month, is targeting a move for a centre-back and revealed on Sunday that he had already lined up three players who he wanted to bring to West Brom this month – but claims that the recently agreed Brexit deal scuppered those plans. Allardyce, who has shopped overseas while on survival missions at Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Everton previously and has found useful players to aid those relegation escapes, indicated that shopping abroad is becoming more difficult after Brexit – which officially began on New Year’s Day – because EU-based players who enjoyed that freedom before now require permits. Ajayi has had a mixed season with West Brom so far, featuring in 16 of the Baggies 17 Premier League games, with a goal to his name and two yellow cards.
