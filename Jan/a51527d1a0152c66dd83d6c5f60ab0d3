Super Eagles defender William Troost-Ekong cannot wait to face his former national team captain, John Mikel Obi, when Watford slugs it tomorrow against Stoke City. Despite the 1-0 home win over Barnsley on Tuesday, Troost-Ekong missed a begging chance to increase the goal tally for Watford . “I’ve just been in the changing room and everyone is very happy, but it won’t mean a lot unless we can get something again on Friday,” he said. “We need to close the week well and we’ve said we need to try and get on a run, so playing Stoke away is going to be a great opportunity for us,” Troost-Ekong told Watford’s website Hive Live.  On missing a scoring chance against Barnsley, he said: “We’ve done the basics and put the foundation in place to have a good week and get a good run going.” “Everyone wants to contribute and I think I should’ve done better with my chance, so that’s going to be haunting me tonight but hopefully soon enough I’ll get another goal,” said Troost-Ekong. “I’m trying to get more goals than Kaba so that was definitely the aim! We’ve got some good competition going with the defenders so I was disappointed about that. “We’ve got midfielders scoring goals though, like in the last game, we’re creating a lot of opportunities and we’re not giving many away,” noted the 27-year-old defender.
