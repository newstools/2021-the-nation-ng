Napoli Manager Gennaro Gattuso has revealed Victor Osimhen is getting better following the shoulder injury he suffered in November 2020. The centre-forward picked up the problem on international duty with the Nigeria national team during their 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying game against Sierra Leone. The 22-year-old is yet to feature for the Parthenopeans since the incident after also testing positive for the coronavirus. The forward contracted the virus following his visit to his country. Osimhen also celebrated his birthday during his stay in Nigeria and has been criticised for his failure to adhere to the Covid-19 protocols during the celebration. Gattuso has now provided updates on the attacker’s injury ahead of their Serie A clash against Fiorentina on January 17. “In the last few days he is better, even the doctors give me comforting news,” Gattuso told the club website. “He has started running well again and we will evaluate when he can get back to his best,” he concluded. Osimhen teamed up with the Stadio San Paolo outfit last summer as the club’s record signing following his eye-catching performances for Lille. The centre-forward immediately became a hit after joining the French side and bagged 13 Ligue 1 goals during his one-year stay with the Great Danes. His form generated interest from a number of clubs before he settled for Napoli and he has scored two goals and provided one assist in nine appearances since his arrival at the Italian club. Osimhen will hope to hit the ground running when he returns from his injury problems and recovers from Covid-19. The Stadio San Paolo outfit is currently sixth on the league table after gathering 31 points from 16 games. The forward remains a key member of the Nigeria national team since he made his debut for the West African country in 2017. Goal
