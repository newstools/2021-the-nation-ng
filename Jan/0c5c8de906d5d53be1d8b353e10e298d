 The camp of Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) leader, Bayelsa Queens, came alive on Monday when the management of the team surprised the girls with various items ranging from outdoor games equipment such as table tennis board, scrabble, chess, monopoly, snooker board and ludo. The team also received food items such as bags of rice, beans, garri and yams. The common rooms were furnished with new 42 inch television and brand new mattresses to motivate the team. The interim Chairman of the club, Robin Aprela, who led the other management team to present the items, said that the Covid-19 palliatives money was received from FIFA through the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). He said it was the money that enabled them to acquire the items for the club to boost the morale and encourage the team to keep up their brilliant performance so far. Technical Adviser of the club, Moses Aduku, thanked the management for the love and stated that the gesture would lift the teamâ€™s spirit. Responding on behalf of the players, assistant captain Abidemi Ibe, was full of appreciation to the management for putting the COVID-19 palliatives from FIFA to good use, while reaffirming their commitment to win the league.
