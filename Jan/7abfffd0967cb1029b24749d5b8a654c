HONG Linh Ha Tinh FC (HLHT) Nigerian striker, Ismahil Akinade is looking forward to a call up to the  Super Eagles following his consistent scoring record abroad. The 26-year old has been a regular scorer at Bray Wanderers, Bohmians, Waterford FC, SHB Da Nang before joining HLHT in the Vietnam V-League. As the Vietnamese season enters week to two, Akinade is targeting highest goal scorer award as he did while featuring for Bohemia of Ireland in 2015 and SHB Da Nang FC last season. He scored 19 goals in Bohemian and 14 goals last season for SHB Da Nang. He said he was inspired by Manchester United legend Roy Keane who presented him the Highest Goal scorer award in Ireland, vowing to also do so again this season, thus his passionate appeal to the Nigerian gaffer to monitor his progress. “Emerging top scorer in Ireland and in V-League with Da Nang are no mean feats but I’m determined to do better this season at Hong Linh. My target is to play for the Super Eagles.”
