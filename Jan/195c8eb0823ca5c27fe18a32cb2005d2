The Global Initiative on Substance Abuse (GISA) has trained over 400 practitioners in evidence-based drug and substance abuse prevention. This comprises 40 national trainers, 295 practitioners, 34 school-based prevention specialists and 33 workplace prevention, management and policy specialists drawn from professions and organisations. Founder/Executive Director of GISA Dr. Martin Agwogie, in a statement to mark the second year anniversary of the commencement of the Universal Prevention Curriculum (UPC) for substance use disorders,  said participants cut across  professions and organisations. The GISA boss said despite the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, the organisation has continued to deliver evidence-based substance abuse prevention training using the virtual platform. GISA, he said, is collaborating with local and international organisations in delivering evidence-based substance abuse prevention interventions. “We recently received a UNODC grant to deliver evidence-based substance abuse prevention interventions in selected secondary schools in Lagos State.”    It will be the first of its kind with over 16,000 students, their parents and teachers as direct beneficiaries from the project. This is a mark of recognition of our expertise in delivering evidence-based interventions,” he said.
