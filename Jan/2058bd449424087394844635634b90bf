The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed conduct of by-election for Kafin Hausa State Constituency, Jigawa State on Saturday, March 6. The commission disclosed this in a statement and election timetable issued by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye, on Thursday in Abuja. Okoye said that the commission met and deliberated on a number of issues including the conduct of the state constituency by-election. The vacancy arose as a result of the death of Adamu Baban-Bare, a member representing Kafin Hausa State Constituency and the subsequent declaration of vacancy for the Constituency by the Speaker of the Jigawa State House of Assembly. Okoye said that the official notification for the election would be issued on Feb. 1, while political parties shall conduct their primaries between Feb. 2 and Feb. 8. “The last day for submission of list of nominated candidates is at 6 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 11. “The access code for the nomination forms shall be available for collection from Feb. 8 at the commission’s headquarters.” Okoye enjoined all parties intending to field candidates to pay close attention to the issued timetable and schedule of activities for the by-election. He also advised them to conduct transparent and valid party primaries that meet the provisions of Section 87 of the Electoral Act 2010 [As Amended]. He noted that a detailed timetable and schedule of activities for the by-election had been uploaded on the commission’s website and social media platforms. (NAN)
