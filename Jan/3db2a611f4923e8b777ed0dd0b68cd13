Boeing is targeting the sustainability of commercial aviation, committing that its commercial aircraft are certified to fly on 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. Boeing has conducted test flights replacing petroleum jet fuel with 100 per cent  sustainable fuels to address climate change. According to the Air Transport Action Group, United States Department of Energy and several other scientific studies, sustainable aviation fuels reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80 per cent  over the fuel’s life cycle with the potential to reach 100 per cent in the future. Today, sustainable aviation fuels are mixed with jet fuel up to a 50/50 blend — the maximum allowed under fuel specifications. To meet aviation’s commitment for reducing carbon emissions by 50 per cent  from 2005 levels by 2050, airplanes need to fly on 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuels well before 2050. Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and Chief Executive Officer  Stan Deal, said: “Our industry and customers are committed to addressing climate change, and sustainable aviation fuels are the safest and most measurable solution to reduce aviation carbon emissions in the coming decades.
