 ABOUT 247 Fulani women under the umbrella of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) will receive N20, 000 grants each from the Federal Government. The grant is expected to improve their economic well-being and also take care of their families. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq revealed this when she launched the Federal Government Special Cash Grant for Rural Women at the Fulani settlement of Hutawa in Kebbi State. This is contained in a statement in Abuja yesterday by the Special Adviser on Media to the Minister, Nneka Anibeze. The Minister, during the launch, said: “I am delighted to see that these Fulani women are being taught the modern methods of yoghurt production using cow milk. “This will go a long way in empowering them to be self-reliant and able to provide for their families. “I enjoin all the Fulani women who have received this training by the Kebbi State government to put it to practice as this will also improve the economic status of not just the women but also the state and country at large.” The Special Cash Grant for Rural women has so far been launched in 16 states, including Plateau, Sokoto, Imo, Ebonyi, Nassarawa, Kebbi, Katsina, Bauchi, Taraba, Ekiti, Ondo, Adamawa, Gombe, Kano, Jigawa and Zamfara states.
