 THE Ethiopian government has arrested a key founding member of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), Sebhat Nega. The Ministry of Defence said Nega, in his 80s, was hiding in a remote area of Tigray. Since November 2020, Ethiopia’s military has been fighting the TPLF which used to govern the region. Last Thursday, the military said several other senior TPLF members had been killed or arrested. The United Nations (UN) has described the humanitarian situation in Tigray as dire with 1.3 million people in need of aid as a result of the conflict. It said food supplies are very limited and schools, hospitals and administrative offices have been looted.
