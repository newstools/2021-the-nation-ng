 WITH the exploits of their star musician, David Adeleke aka Davido, the Adeleke family has become a household name in Nigeria. But before his fame grew, there was Isiaka Adeleke, who was governor of Osun State back in 1991 and was highly respected in the political arena. Unfortunately, at 62, the former governor’s life was cut short in April 2017. A few days ago, his younger brother, Ademola Adeleke, popularly known as the dancing senator, celebrated his posthumous birthday. Describing him as a mentor and benefactor, he said his absence on his birthday left him distraught as well as millions of people who would forever cherish his wonderful roles in their lives. He said: “You’re not here but memories of the great moments we shared together console me. How wonderful would it have been that you’re with us to celebrate your 66th birthday?  I miss every second of your exit and wish you’re still here with us. “Even though you’re no more, you live on, Asiwaju. You’re always in my mind and those of millions you made incredible impacts while alive. As the first elected Governor of Osun State, your legacy of good governance and unmatched philanthropic gestures will stay forever in the minds of the people. “On your birthday and every other day because you have been the sweetest part of my life, I celebrate you for the wonderful grace that nature used you to serve for humanity. Every second of my life, I cherish the memories of you and today, I wish you joy and unceasing blessings of Almighty Allah on you in Heaven.” Until his death, the late Adeleke was a serving member of the National Assembly representing Osun West Senatorial District. He headed the Senate Committee on Capital Market.
