Founder of Kynkys Herbal World, Nkemjika Greatness Uzoma, is a woman of high worth whose success story is testimony to human endurance and painstaking commitment to excellence. Born on April 17, 1997 to Mr. and Mrs. Francis and Adaku Uzoma, the indigene of Abia said the wonderful upbringing she got from home helped in shaping her business ideals and values. These, she said, have manifested profoundly in the success story of her business brand. She was educated at the University of Western Cape in South Africa, where she bagged a Bachelor of Science degree with honours. Uzoma, while reflecting on her formative years with her parents, said: “Growing up was fun, growing up with siblings and having my parents beside me was everything. I have fond memories of growing up. It was a good experience. “My parents showed me and my siblings much love. It was fun growing up. Sometimes, I wish I could roll back the years to soak in all the good memories but like everything in the past. ‘’It is in the past but the good memories linger on in my mind forever.” Having been on the receiving end of such a great show of affection and good upbringing from her parents, Uzoma’s journey to business success was horned in the process. Since her skin beauty products, Kynkys Herbal World, hit the market some years ago, the story has been that of high patronage from customers from far and wide who throng sales outlets to purchase the products. Speaking on how she has been able to manage her customers, Uzoma said: “It’s all about staying true to the honest principles that I learnt from my parents and having respect for my customers because without them, we would not be in business. “And even more important is to stay simple, honest and give your utmost best for the good of humanity. “I also ensure that our products are of the highest quality because if they are top-notch, our customers will be satisfied and they will always come back for more of our offerings.”
