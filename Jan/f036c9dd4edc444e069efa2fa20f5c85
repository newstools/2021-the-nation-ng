Despite claims that Pep Guardiola does not want the defender to leave the club this transfer window, this report claims that he is in fact set to seal a deal to join Barcelona. Not only is Garcia set to complete a move to the La Liga side but the deal is believed to be on a free transfer – meaning that City won’t receive a fee for him. In his youth, Garcia played for the Catalan giants before switching to England and to Man City. He then continued to play for the Premier League side’s reserve teams before making his league debut as an 18-year old last season. He went on to make 13 league appearances for City and has continued to feature for the side this campaign. Making three appearances so far this season, boss Guardiola seems keen to keep the player. However, it appears as though he is now set to lose the 20-year old on what could be a free transfer to his former team.
