The police in Adamawa State have launched an investigation into a beach party, which was planned for January 3 to hold in Yola. Although the party was never held, following public outcry and warning by the police, the command said it would fish out the sponsors for prosecution. Spokesman DSP Suleiman Nguroje said in a statement on Monday that the police commissioner had ordered investigation into the matter. “Anyone found involved will be arrested and prosecuted,” he said. Nguroje added: “The commissioner of police has ordered investigation to unravel the sponsors and venue of the party. The command will not allow any immoral activity that can cause public outrage.” Notice for the party had circulated on social media platforms, with invitation to adults on charge of a gate fee of N2,000 each. It was learnt that venue of the botched party was not stated, and it is difficult to speculate because Yola does not have a known beach facility despite having River Benue running through it. The party idea came as a surprise to many residents, as Adamawa is a religious state with near equal population of Muslims and Christians.
