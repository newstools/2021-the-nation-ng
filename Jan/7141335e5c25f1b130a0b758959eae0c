 Major shareholders of Prestige Assurance Plc renounced their rights and refused to fully take up the shares pre-allotted to them in the quest by the insurance company to raise N6.82 billion in new equity funds. Prestige Assurance had, in August 2020, offered 13.636 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to existing shareholders at a par value of 50 kobo. The rights were pre-allotted on the basis of 38 new ordinary shares for every 15 ordinary shares held as at January 31, 2020. As at the time of the offer, the New India Assurance Company Limited, Mumbai, the precursor and founder of Prestige Assurance, held 69.50 per cent majority equity stake in the Nigerian subsidiary while Leadway Assurance Company, an unlisted Nigerian insurance company, also held 11.47 per cent equity stake.  This implied about 80.97 per cent equity stakes within the two major shareho0lders. Market analysts had expected that the traditional support of major shareholders for recapitalisation would enable the insurance company to meet its target, especially with the new shares offered at par value. Regulatory filing, however, indicated that the rights issue recorded a subscription level of 50.54 per cent, with the company being able to raise about N3.45 billion out of its target of N6.82 billion. Shareholders picked up 6.89 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at 50 kobo per share, out of the 13.636 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each offered to investors. The rights issue process was completed yesterday with the listing of the new issued shares of 6.89 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). With the listing of the 6.89 billion new shares, the total issued and fully paid up shares of Prestige Assurance increased from 6.36 billion to 13.253 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. Shareholders of Prestige Assurance had created additional new 14 billion ordinary shares to create headroom for the new capital raising. The company increased its authorised share capital from N3 billion of 6.0 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to N10 billion of 20 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each through the creation of additional 14 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. Market analysts, however, noted that the undersubscription might have corrected Prestige Assurance’s free float deficiency. Prestige Assurance was 1.05 per cent below the regulatory minimum of 20 per cent for its listing on the main board of the Exchange. The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) had in May 2019 released new capital requirements for insurance businesses, mandating operators to shore up their minimum capital base to the required level. The minimum paid-up share capital of a life insurance company was increased from N2 billion to N8 billion, non-life insurance from N3 billion to N10 billion, composite insurance from N5 billion to N18 billion while re-insurance companies were directed to raise their capital base from N10 billion to N20 billion.
