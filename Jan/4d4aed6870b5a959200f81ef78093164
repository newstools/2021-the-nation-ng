Popular Afro Juju musician, Sir Shina Peters, has been ordained a bishop of the Cherubim and Seraphim Church. The legendary singer was ordained at a ceremony in a Cherubim and Seraphim Church in the Iju area of Lagos on Saturday. The singer shared a video and photo of his ordination on his Instagram handle on Sunday with the caption, ‘‘Bishop with the swagger. God above all.” On his Facebook page, the ace singer wrote: “To God be the glory. I will serve my God till the end’’. Ovation International magazine publisher Dele Momodu wrote: ‘‘Congratulations Bishop Isaac Oluwashina Akanbi Peters. Ore mi pataki pataki. A ti ko esu ati gbogbo ise buruku owo re sile (My very very dear friend. We have rejected the devil and all his evil works)”. The singer’s most recent music was collaboration with Teni on her hit, ‘Jo’, released in December 2020.  SSP, as he is fondly called, released his debut album as a solo musician, Ace (Afro-Juju Series 1), in 1989.
