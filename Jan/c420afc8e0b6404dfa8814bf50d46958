ROGER Federer has a ninth Wimbledon triumph in him, with the Swiss star prioritising the All England Club and Olympics in 2021, so said  Australian Todd Woodbridge. Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, confirmed fitness issues after two knee operations in 2020 mean fans will not see him in action at the Australian Open for the first time in more than two decades. The current men’s calendar would suggest the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam from March 1 could be the first stop in 2021 for the former world No 1. Federer, who has not missed a trip to Melbourne Park since a loss in qualifying in 1999, suffered a semi-final defeat against eventual winner Novak Djokovic last year but he has not played a competitive match since.
