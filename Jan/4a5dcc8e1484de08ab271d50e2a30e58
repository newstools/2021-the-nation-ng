The Police Command in Bauchi on Monday confirmed the kidnap of 25-year-old Zulkifiru Mohammed, the son of the State Auditor General, Abdu Usman Aliyu by unknown gunmen. The Spokesman of the command, DSP Ahmed Wakili who confirmed the development to the Nation in a phone interview said Aliyu sustained bullet wounds after being shot while his 50-year-old friend Iliyasu Suleiman was also abducted. Wakili said the gunmen shot and injured Aliyu when he resisted them before making away with his son and friend. He said the incident occurred at the weekend on the auditor-general’s way to Kardam village while travelling to visit his family and friends in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area. According to him, there were about six people in the auditor-general’s car which included three men and three women when the gunmen who were said to have trailed him opened fire, severely wounding him in the process. The PPRO added that Aliyu was shot at close range by the attackers after he resisted them while others in the car ran for safety saying that a resident of Kardam reported the incident at the Tafawa Balewa police division. ”Thinking that he (Aliyu) was dead, others in his car abandoned him and ran into the bush leaving him in a pool of blood before help came his way through other users of the road who evacuated and rushed him to General Hospital in Tafawa Balewa before he was transferred to another hospital where he is on admission. ”Police personnel at the Tafawa Balewa Division went to the scene but the assailants had already gone away with the two victims, one of who is the biological son of the injured auditor general.” DSP Ahmed Wakili said that the police is on the trail of the kidnappers. The daughter of Abdu Usman Aliyu, who was in the car when the attack happened, also confirmed to newsmen in Bauchi that the kidnappers have made contact demanding for the sum of N30 million in order to release the two victims, adding that negotiations were ongoing.
