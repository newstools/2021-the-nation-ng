Catholic Bishop of Nnewi Diocese, Anambra state, Most Rev. Hilary Odili has urged Christians to love one another and to overcome evil as exemplified by Jesus Christ. He also stressed the need for christians to recognise the sacredness of the Church as an institution under the authority and guidance of God. The Prelate spoke weekend while dedicating the St. Philip’s Catholic Church, Ozubulu in Ekwusigo Local Government Area of the state, barely four years it was attacked by unknown gunmen, leaving no fewer than thirteen worshippers dead. He regretted loss of lives during the dastardly attack, maintaining that love for mankind distinguished the Christian religion from other religions. While warning against using the church for other activities that would not glorify God, the cleric insisted that the church should be a house of prayer and not a place for politics. He said, “As the house of God, the Church should be a house of prayer for the faithful not a place for politics. We should desist from using the church for other activities that do not give glory to God.” Bishop Odili also prayed for God’s guidance on the Church and the people throughout the year, expressing confidence that the gate of hell would never prevail against the Church. He thanked Chief Aloysius Ikegwuonu for his magnanimous disposition to the church and mankind, including building the church single handedly, praying for God’s blessings on him. The benefactor, Chief Ikegwuonu who thanked God for his providence in serving him and humanity, also appreciated the Church for their prayers which he said sustained him after the tragedy that befell the Church, praying against reoccurrence of such ugly incident. Highlights of the event which attracted other Catholic Bishops, priests and the Traditional Ruler of Ozubulu, Igwe Fidelis Oruche, were the dedication of the multi-million naira Church, Grotto and a Chapel all built by Ikegwuonu.
