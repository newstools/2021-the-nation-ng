By Chris Njoku, Owerri The proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has raised the alarm of systemic elimination of civilians in Okporo Orlu, Imo State. It spoke just as the streets and roads of Okporo Orlu remained deserted with several businesses closed down for fear of death. Speaking to the Nation, the IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said the killings were alarming. “Soldiers are shooting anybody at sight or anybody they suspect to be a member of Eastern Security Network (ESN). “They are aiming and shooting at civilians, anybody they see in the street or road they will shoot. We have challenged them to come to the bush and meet us there but they are looking for us on the streets and roads.” He expressed sadness over the killing of innocent people, adding they would not want a repeat of what happened in Obigbo Rivers State in Imo. Meanwhile, streets and roads in the villages remained deserted on Wednesday as residents stayed indoors to avoid being caught in the crossfires.
