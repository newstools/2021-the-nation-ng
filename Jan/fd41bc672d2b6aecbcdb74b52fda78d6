 My fellow countrymen and women,  First, I would like to thank and praise the Almighty who saw us through the year 2020 and has given us the opportunity to witness the start of another new year. We especially thank God because the year 2020 was one of the most trying years since our existence as a Nation. ON SECURITY: ON THE ECONOMY: ANTI-CORRUPTION:  May God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
