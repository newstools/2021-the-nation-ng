Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Sunday warned Lagosians on the devastating effect of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. He appealed to them to take COVID-19 protocols seriously, as the pandemic is not a glamorous disease or a hoax as some people claim it is. “Lagosians, COVID-19 is not a glamorous disease, neither is it a hoax. You need to follow the safety guidelines to safeguard your friends and loved ones. “In the midst of increasing COVID-19 cases, we have some good news from our Infectious Diseases Hospital,” Sanwo-Olu tweeted. Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat had said the second wave of the pandemic affected people across different age groups. He spoke while announcing the death of his 37-year-old brother, who died of COVID-19. The deceased, Haroun, who worked as a doctor at Orile Agege, helped a lot of patients, the deputy governor said.
