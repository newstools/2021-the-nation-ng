A popular nursery rhyme says:
‘Tick says the clock, Tick, tick. What you have to do, Do quick!’ Procrastination is a disease a lot of people suffer from. This disease has eaten up into the very existence of most humans. You find people postponing a task or taking a decision for later. Procrastination simply means the act of delaying to carry out a task on purpose or intentionally. Procrastination will always bring about negative outcomes. It puts you in a very tight corner. I can cite an example. Let’s use the case of the NIN (National Identification Number) registration. It will interest us to know that the requirement for NIN was made law in 2007 by Section 16 of the National Identity Management Commission Act. We had as a people, enough time to go out to do our registration so we could be issued our numbers and our cards but most persons never bothered to go out to register. But for some, it was never considered important. For others, they won’t need it for anything” or “not any time soon”. But alas! The issue of linking our phone lines with our National Identification Number popped up and more than half of the entire population was thrown off balance. They were immediately put on their toes principally as they stand the chance of having their lines blocked. That is what procrastination can do. It will deny you the joy of finishing well. Most procrastinators ultimately do not have the time to even start up anything talk more of finishing. Thus, they find themselves overwhelmed with deep regrets. That decision or choice you have to make, don’t put it off for later; make it now.
