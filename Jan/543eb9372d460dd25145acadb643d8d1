  IN a joint effort to promote health safety for Nigerians amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, My World of Bags (MWOB), a bag design and manufacturing company, in partnership with Mastercard Foundation, is producing and distributing free Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) across a series of states. Beyond the physical PPE materials, Project SafeUp, which kicked off in November last year, has also been sensitising locals about the virus and the importance of protective measures, by using handouts, and catchy and informative multi-ethnic radio jingles, across multiple radio stations in Oyo, Lagos, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti dialects. Commenting on the PPE donations to schools and hospitals in Lagos, Ekiti, Osun and Oyo States, Sinmi Olayebi, Director of Social Programs at FemiHandbags said, “Communication is our greatest tool in the fight against the pandemic. No one is left out in the fight for survival, and that certainly includes our grassroots communities. We have to meet them right where they are, to ensure that we can pass on our critical messaging of health and safety at this time.”
