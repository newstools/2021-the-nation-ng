  Heartland FC cannot register new players for the current 2020-21 NPFL season after the League Management Company (LMC) activated the decision of the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber dated February 19th , 2020 which barred the Owerri side from registering new players throughout this season. In a letter written to Heartland FC and copied to all the clubs in the Nigeria Professional Football League for compliance the Chief Operating Officer, LMC, Salihu Abubakar wrote: “We refer to previous correspondence in respect of the above, including in particular, the decision of the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber dated 19th February, 2020, as a result of which Heartland FC is currently banned from registering new players. “We would like to reiterate that the implication of the above is that Heartland FC is not eligible or permitted to register or feature any new player(s) in its squad for the on-going 2020-21 season. “This ban is to be enforced strictly, failing which appropriate sanctions will be meted out. “Relevant stakeholders are by this notice advised to take note and enforce accordingly.” Heartland FC have been sanctioned by FIFA owing to their inability to offset Santos Da Costa Ivo Jorge’s debt when he was with them some seasons ago and the ban will be lifted as soon as they comply with the FIFA directive to pay up the Brazilian.
