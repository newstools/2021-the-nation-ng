 Nigeria international Victor Osimhen  would yet again miss a historic game involving his Italian side  as Napoli  host Spezia in their first ever  Serie A contest today at the Stadio Maradona. Spezia  are one of the new teams in the Serie A after gaining promotion to the top tier for the first time via play-offs in the 2019–20 season  and today  will be their  first contest  against Napoli in the Serie A. Osimhen  has been out injured  since November  after dislocating his shoulder  during the   2021 AFCON  duel against Sierra Leone in Benin and  will not be available for this important game  for obvious  reasons. Apart from recuperating  from his injury, Osimhen  is reportedly  quarantined  after testing positive for COVID-19  following his recent ill-fated trip to Nigeria during the Yuletide.  As such, Osimhen  is listed amongst the players that will be unavailable  for coach Gennaro Gattuso along with Dries Mertens and Kalidou Koulibaly. Today’s match offers a mouth-watering prospect  since Napoli have the best defensive record in Serie A with just 13 goals conceded as they host a Spezia side that earned eight of their 11 points away from home. Meanwhile, Maurizio Mariani  who  has refereed Napoli 11 times in Serie A, has been appointed to referee the Week 16 clash against  Spezia. Mariani will be joined by assistants Marco Bresmes and Damiano Margani, fourth official Davide Ghersini and VAR operators Luca Banti and Stefano Del Giovane for the 6pm kick-off.
