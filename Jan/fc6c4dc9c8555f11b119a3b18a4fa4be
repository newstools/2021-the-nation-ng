 Victor Osimhen is set to return to action for Napoli before the end of February. The Nigeria international has not been on the pitch since his injury in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sierra Leone in November. The 22-year-old tested positive again after a new coronavirus test on Monday and is expected to still be out for 20 to 30 days.. Osimhen had tested positive for the virus after returning from a trip to Nigeria and has been self-isolating since then. The striker’s first test which returned positive on arrival in Naples kicked off a chain of events that landed him in trouble with Napoli. The Serie A club giants were unhappy to see a video of Osimhen dancing and spraying money at a party in Lagos with complete disregard to COVID-19 protocols. Although Osimhen apologised, Napoli manager Gennaro Gattuso said Osimhen would pay for the ‘silly mistake’. This latest development continues Osimhen’s frustrating spell at Napoli so far where he has just played six league games, scoring two goals and providing one assist.
