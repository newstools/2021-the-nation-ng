Ghanaâ€™s government has announced January 27 for the burial of former President Jerry Rawlings. The former president will lie in state for public viewing from 24 to 26 January, the government confirmed in a statement. The burial is scheduled to take place on 27 January. He died in mid-November at the age of 73 after being admitted to a hospital in Accra. The funeral was slated for before Christmas but postponed following disagreement among Ghanaian traditional leaders. Rawlings led Ghana for almost 20 years after staging two military coups as a young officer in 1979 and 1981. He returned the country to multiparty democracy in 1992.
