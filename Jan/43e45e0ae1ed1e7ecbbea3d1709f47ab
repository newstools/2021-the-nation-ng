A boxing enthusiast, Abdul Wahab Adekunle has rewarded the winner of World Boxing Federations (WBF) Super Featherweight world belt, Ridwan ‘Scorpion’ Oyekola with a jaguar car worth N6million,  saying it’s a fulfillment of a promise he made to the boxer. Speaking yesterday at the presentation ceremony, Adekunle said: “Sports has become a big time money spinning venture globally. All over the world we can see the financial landmark all of them are bringing from Africa to Europe, but it seems we’re yet to come to term with this fact but I believe we can easily get there if we keep encourage them this way and hope they will keep getting better. “I want to use this medium to advise the federal government to identify with sports as another income earner. It is unthinkable that the United Kingdom (UK) post a whooping one billion pounds as foreign exchange income from football alone. One can imagine if we develop and encourage our sports men and women by building facilities to enhance their preparation and see what we will get in return,” the founder and CEO of Hamex Group explained. The President of Nigeria Boxing Board of Control (NBB of C) Dr. Rafiu Ladipo thanked the donor who also supported the organization of the boxing event with N10m in logistics, for his spirited gesture towards boxing. The presentation was witnessed by the Secretary of NBB of C Remi Aboderin, Chairman Oyo State NBB of C Hon. Gbenga Opaleye, the CEO of Core Afrique Promotions and promoter of the fight Olusola Ayodele, and Edna and Faith Ayegbeni, both daughter of late Ibadan based boxing promoter Francis Ayegbeni.
