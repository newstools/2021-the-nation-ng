Governors of the 36 states are worried that despite the intensity of the second wave of the coronavirus, the country is yet to begin the vaccination  of its citizens. They have, therefore, scheduled their meeting for tomorrow to deliberate on the development and other pressing national issues. NGF’s spokesman, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, who stated these in a statement on Monday, said the meeting would entertain briefing from Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, who heads the Governors’ PTF Committee that relates with the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Covid-19 issues. According to Bello-Barkindo, Okowa is expected to brief the governors on what they need to know on the COVID-19 vaccines and the way forward. He added that Okowa would equally provide “a panoramic view of the second wave of the pandemic,” at the 23rd virtual meeting of the NGF, scheduled to begin by 2p.m. Bello-Barkindo added that the NGF Chairman and Ekiti State Governor John Kayode Fayemi will brief the forum on his meeting with the President as well as update the forum on pending matters that have remained inconclusive, flowing from the previous year’s meetings. “According to the invitation to governors issued by the Director-General of the NGF Mr Asishana B Okauru, these matters include ALGON and FAAC deductions, external debts reconciliation (2002-2018), Stamp Duty collections in respect of the governors’ letter to the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), and another response to the Ministry of Water Resources regarding the lingering Water Resources Bill, among others.”
