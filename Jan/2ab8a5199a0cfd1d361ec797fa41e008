kevin Campbell fears West Brom will struggle to keep hold of Semi Ajayi beyond the summer, especially if they are relegated from the Premier League. The former Baggies and Arsenal striker, speaking exclusively to Football Insider, claimed that “bigger clubs” are monitoring the 27-year-old’s performances with a view to signing him in the next transfer window. Ajayi has missed only one game for Sam Allardyce’s side in the Premier League this season and played the full ninety minutes of yesterday’s 2-1 loss at West Ham. The Nigeria international has also scored two crucial goals for the Baggies this term, the equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Anfield and the second in a 3-2 win at Wolves last weekend.  A £1.5million signing from Rotherham in July 2019, Ajayi has established himself as one of the first names on the team-sheet at The Hawthorns over the past 18 months. When asked by Football Insider for his thoughts on the centre-half’s displays this season, Campbell said: “He’s been brilliant. “I definitely think the bigger clubs are looking at him, for sure. They will be watching the plight West Brom are on right now. “They will look to how he handles the pressure and he has handed himself brilliantly so far. He has chipped in with a few goals of late as well which helps. “I just think it will be difficult for the club to keep hold of him beyond the summer. The bigger clubs will definitely be looking to do some business for Ajayi.”
