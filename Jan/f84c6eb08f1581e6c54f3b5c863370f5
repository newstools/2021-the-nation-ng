Noble laureate Prof Wole Soyinka, on Wednesday said the Muhammadu Buhari administration has lost steam in the anti-graft war. This, according to him, has resulted in fewer looters being convicted and jailed. Speaking on an AIT programme, Kakaaki, the playwright claimed that the prosecution process was being manipulated Soyinka said: “There are so many people who should be in prison, if this government had not run out of steam, and so, the system is being manipulated. “There are cases where the prosecution had reached the level where evidence had been given on governors who had been stealing and depositing in bits and pieces so as not to flout a certain regulation. “I mean cases have been taken to that level and suddenly, silence. The EFCC, which I back solidly ever since the days of Nuhu Ribadu, in all kinds of ways, we no longer know the distinguishing from rights and left.”
