Despite his ordeal in the hands of kidnappers, the Deputy Vice-chancellor of Anchor University Lagos (AUL), Prof. Johnson Fatokun says his faith in God remains unmoved. Speaking after his release, Fatokun said he would continue to work and pray for the country’s progress. He said: “Despite the experience, my faith remains unshakable. We will continue to work, pray and raise godly men and women who are destined to change the narratives and make Nigeria a better place for the generations ahead.” Fatokun, who was abducted on Sunday on his way from Jos and released on Wednesday after three days in captivity, is expected back in Lagos today. In a statement by the Assistant Registrar, Strategy and Communications, Okesola Sanusi, the University thanked the security agencies and Deeper Life Church and campus Fellowship for their prayers and support through the ordeal. The statement reads: “The Vice-Chancellor and Management of Anchor University joyfully announce the release of our Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Prof Johnson. O.
