The all-week rally pushed average year-to-date return for Nigerian equities to 2.25 per cent, building on 50.03 per cent posted as full-year return for 2020. A review of global stock markets showed a negative trend, with Nigeria recording the second highest positive return among tracked advanced, frontier and emerging markets, trailing Egypt, which posted 4.6 per cent.

Most analysts expected the rally at the Nigerian stock market to continue as investors take positions ahead of the release of the audited report and accounts and dividends for the immediate past business year. More than three-quarters of quoted companies use the Gregorian calendar ending December 31 as business year, thus are expected to submit their full-year report not later than March 31, 2021 in line with the market rules that require quoted companies to submit their audited financial statement not later than 90 days after the end of the business year. “In the short term, we expect the bulls to retain dominance in the market given positioning for full-year 2020 dividends amid negative real returns in the fixed income market even as we do not rule out intermittent profit-taking,” Cordros Securities stated in a review at the weekend. Analysts at Cordros Securities, however, advised investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings. “We believe the bullish momentum would be sustained in the coming week due to positive sentiments, although we may see some profit-taking activities,” Afrinvest Securities stated.

The financial services sector remained the most active with a turnover of 1.714 billion shares valued at N13.352 billion traded in 15,102 deals; thus contributing 49.74 per cent and 40.80 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The construction and real estate sector followed with 768.131 million shares worth N4.203 billion in 430 deals while conglomerates sector placed third with a turnover of 279.799 million shares worth N578.694 million in 1,199 deals.
