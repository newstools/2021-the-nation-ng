MANCHESTER United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has given the nod for Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo to be art of United squad that will face Watford in Saturday’s FA Cup match. During a media briefing, which was streamed at 1:30pm on United’s official app, he was asked about Ighalo. Ighalo is due to return to China when his loan spell expires at the end of the month. He wasn’t in the squad for Wednesday night’s 2-0 loss against Manchester City but Solskjaer said he would be involved against his old club. “Odion, it’s special for him against Watford, he will be involved, he’s in the squad,” said Solskjaer.  “He’s been training really well, he was the top scorer in round robin we just finished. He’s not lost any of his quality, it’s been difficult for him to be out of the squad as many times as he has because he did really well up until the summer. “This season he’s not had as many opportunities and not let himself down as a professional and a human being. He’s always a positive influence in the dressing room. Hopefully I don’t need to put him on in that we need goals, but hopefully he can join in.” Ighalo said earlier this week he was hoping to play against his former employers.
