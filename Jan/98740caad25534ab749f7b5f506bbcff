 Following Tunde Ednut’s ban from Instagram, top Nigerian celebrities have begun rallying support for his return on the social media platform. The celebrities leading the call for the return of Ednut’s page on Instagram include 2baba, AY, and Daddy Freeze. 2baba wrote on his Instagram page “Instagram do the needful. Free Tunde Ednut page. Then tell us who packaged this downing p abeg. Wa gwan!”. On his part, comedian AY wrote, “Mistakes made and lessons learned. Instagram kindly bring back the Tunde Ednut account. And to those whom he may have offended directly or indirectly kindly forgive and forget.” “Tunde Ednut is a great guy, we want him back”, wrote Daddy Freeze.  Sound Sultan also posted “Hello Instagram can you please restore my guy Tunde Ednut ‘s page. Consider the comment section, a petition signed, we miss him and for those offended by the tribal slurs, I apologise on his behalf! Mark Z oshe.” Actor Abimbola Kazeem aka Jigan also joined his colleagues to appeal to the management of Instagram saying, “ With God and your support that is what got me this far so you can’t come down Tunde Ednut! Instagram, please restore his page.” The celebrities have continued to plead with the management of Instagram on the singer cum social media influencer’s behalf to get his account restored. Before the page was pulled down, it had over two million followers. Tunde Ednut’s Instagram page was taken down by Instagram days back following several reports by unknown persons. Since his removal, the social media influencer and singer has been off the social media radar. The pulling down of his page came a few days after his wedding in the United States of America.
