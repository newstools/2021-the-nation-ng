 ONCE upon a time, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Akamu Adetunji, and the ’23 kings’ who former Oyo State Governor, Isiaka Ajimobi, gave crowns to, couldn’t share the same room. Their rift was only put to rest when current Governor Seyi Makinde withdrew their crowns as part of the condition to settle out of court. Eminent personalities, indigenes of Ibadan, clubs and societies in the ancient city including former President Olusegun Obasanjo had tried to wade into the conflict but were unsuccessful. Recently, the high chiefs graced Olubadan’s queen, Olori Ololade Adetunji’s 70 birthday party which held at Jogor Event Centre in Ibadan. After the Oba walked in with the celebrant, all the chiefs stepped out and prostrated before him to pay homage. It was their first public appearance after their differences with Olubadan was settled by Makinde and they all had fun at the event. The birthday party also had in attendance personalities like Captain Kola Karim, Mr. Ayo Karim, Hon. Joseph Tegbe, Oloye Akin Fijabi, Cheif Lekan Alabi, Bayo Adelabu, Chief Folashade Tinubu Ojo
