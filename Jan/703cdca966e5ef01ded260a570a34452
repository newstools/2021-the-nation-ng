Michail Antonio scored his first goal since October as West Ham defeated a lacklustre Burnley at London Stadium. The 30-year-old forward, who coming into the game had only made four appearances since October because of hamstring problems, slotted home Pablo Fornals’ cross in the ninth minute. The Hammers were the greater attacking threat and went close again when Angelo Ogbonna’s header came off the woodwork, before Antonio’s effort was cleared off the line by Ben Mee. Sean Dyche’s Clarets never really got going as an attacking force, although they improved marginally after the break following Dwight McNeil’s introduction. The midfielder produced a cross that came off the bar while Mee sent a header a foot wide. Brighton’s win at Leeds means Burnley are now down to 17th, four points above the drop zone, and West Ham are up to eighth. The Hammers have 10 more points than they did at this stage last season, and have scored six more goals. The manager likened himself to a headteacher this week, stating his side “must do better”, but many will think his players have already surpassed pre-season expectations. Key to this healthier return has been the addition of creative and goalscoring midfielders such as Jarrod Bowen and Tomas Soucek, who have become vital cogs in the side a year after signing, while £30m capture Said Benrahma appears to be gradually rediscovering his Brentford form. Winger Bowen, who cost £18m, has an incredible engine and against the Clarets appeared to act as a second striker to Antonio because of the amount of times he found himself in the area. It was his good work on the left of the area which allowed Fornals to provide the cross for the opener. Antonio, 30, was already important to Moyes and is now even more so after the Sebastien Haller experiment failed. The former winger scored a glut of goals towards the end of last season and began this campaign well before hamstring injuries hampered his progress.
