 Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets is one win away from qualifying for the CAF U-17 holding in Morocco as the coach Fatai Amoo-tutored side battle Burkina Faso today in the second semi-final of the WAFU U-17 Championship taking place in Lome, Togo. The Golden Eaglets who were on the brink of exit in Group B qualified after Ghana were hammered 3-1 by Cote d’Ivoire on Tuesday to give the Nigerian side a passage to the semi-final. Burkina are Group A leader following the disqualification of host Togo after two of their players failed to pass the MRI test. They were considered to have withdrawn from the competition, and all previous matches played by them were considered “null and void” and would not be considered in determining the final group rankings for Burkina Faso to top the group. The free-goal scoring Burkinabe side is expected to square up against the goal-shy Nigerian side at Stade de Kégué, Lome. In the first semi-final, Cote d’Ivoire will slug it out against Niger Republic to ascertain their qualification in the CAF U-17 Championship. The winners in the two semi-final matches will secure their places in the continental showpiece holding later this year in Morocco
