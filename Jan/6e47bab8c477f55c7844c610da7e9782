 AL-MERRIKH coach Didier Gomes Da Rosa said the early goal against Nigeria side Enyimba in Aba proved to be handy in their quest to qualify for the group stage of the CAF Champions League. Enyimba failed in their quest to overturn a 3-0 deficit suffered in Sudan after they could only manage a 2-1 win at home to crash out of the CAF Champions League 4-2 on aggregate. Saif Terry, who fired a hat-trick in the first game in Sudan, opened scoring in Aba after just seven minutes when he punished some slack defending by the home team. A brace from Victor Mbaoma in either half gave the People’s Elephant a win but it was not enough and so the two-times African champions will now have to drop to the second-tier CAF Confederation Cup final playoffs. “We knew very well before the match that if we were able to score, things would be very easy. Fortunately we scored very early in the match and that made it easier for us,” the Frenchman said, showering praises on the ability of his players to stick to their tactics. “We controlled the attacking force of Enyimba as much as we could, though we conceded a penalty, but the main target was to score and that was exactly what we got. We knew that if we scored a goal in the match, Enyimba would find it hard to score up to five goals. The former coach of Ismaily of Egypt added: “Enyimba is a good side, that was why we transited the ball as soon as we got the ball and that was why we came out victorious. “In the two matches, we have been able to show that we are better than Enyimba.” On the delay tactics by the players Da Rosa said “I don’t like my players falling down. It is very important to be more mature, but I don’t want to criticize my players today. “In the past four years we have been able to go through the group stage of Champions League, it is a joy that we are back on the group stage of the Champions League.”
