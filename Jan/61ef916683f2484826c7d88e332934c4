 First City Monument Bank Limited (FCMB) has appointed Yemisi Edun as its Acting Managing Director. Her appointment yesterday followed the decision of the Managing Director, Adam Nuhu, on Tuesday “to proceed on leave” to allow the Board investigate alleged unethical conduct accusation against him. The bank is probing allegations of unethical conduct against Nuru. The bank chief has been at the centre of a marriage scandal involving Moyo Thomas, a former employee of the bank, and his late husband, Tunde Thomas. A petition initiated by friends of the deceased had alleged that Tunde died of depression after discovering that his supposed two children with Moyo belong to the FCMB MD. Edun holds a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from the University of Ife, Ile-Ife and a Master’s degree in International Accounting and Finance from the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. She is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria and a CFA Charter holder. She is also an Associate Member of the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers; an Associate Member of the Institute of Taxation of Nigeria; a Member of Information Systems Audit and Control, U.S.; and a Certified Information Systems Auditor. She began her career with Akintola Williams Deloitte (member firm of Deloitte Touché Tohmatsu) in 1987, with main focus in Corporate Finance. She was also involved in audit of banks and other financial institutions. She joined FCMB in 2000 as Divisional Head of Internal Audit and Control before assuming the role of Chief Financial Officer of the bank.
