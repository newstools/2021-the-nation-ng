Unknown gunmen have killed a police officer identified simply as Michael, injured two other cops and cart away two guns belonging to the victims. The incident, which occurred on Sunday evening at Borokiri in Port Harcourt City Local Government Area, Rivers State, threw the area into panic. The policemen were said to be at their duty post along the Captain Amangala Junction in Borikiri when the bandits attacked them. A source, who spoke in confidence, said, that cultist terrorising the area launched the attack. He said  the attackers came in through Orupolo waterside and opened fire on the policemen. The source further claimed that cultists, involved in illegal bunkering, and illegal refining of crude oil carried out the act. He said the assailants may have have engaged in the act following repeated harassment and extortion by the policemen at the checkpoint. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Rivers State Police Command, SP. Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the development. He said that investigation has been ordered by the Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, to fish out the perpetrators. Omoni said: “I can confirm the development where one of our men was killed. The Commissioner of Police has ordered for investigation. I am not aware of the criminals taking guns belonging to the policemen.”
