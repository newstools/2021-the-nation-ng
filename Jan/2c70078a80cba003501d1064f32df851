 Construction work on the Ijebu-Ode-Itamapako-Epe road in Ogun State has reached 65 per cent completion, the Project Manager, Craneburg Construction, Amine Tawk, has said. He said yesterday that barring any unforeseen circumstance, the road would soon be ready for use. Amine said over 30 communities stand to benefit from the economic proceeds of the road when completed. The road project was awarded by Governor Dapo Abiodun, who during one of the inspection tours of roads across the state pledged that the 14.7km Ijebu-Ode-Epe road would be inaugurated in the second half of 2021. Works and Infrastructure Commissioner Ade Akinsanya said the move to build the road was borne out of the desire to stimulate economic activities, secure and create a safe environment for business to thrive, as well as improve the quality of life of the people. He added that the road, when completed in the second quarter of the year, would enhance accessibility to communities along the area and reduce the burden of vehicle maintenance.
