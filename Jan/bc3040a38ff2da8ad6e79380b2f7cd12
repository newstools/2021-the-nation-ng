The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has said it will continue to encourage partnership with the private sector to provide facilities where aircraft can be maintained to boost the fight against insurgency. Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, spoke on Tuesday during a visit to Caverton Helicopters in Ikeja, the Lagos State capital, where he inspected the company’s Maintenance and Full Flight Simulator facilities. Abubakar expressed his excitement with the facility on the ground, saying: “It will provide an avenue whereby aircraft and helicopters can be serviced, instead of flying them abroad for maintenance. “What I have seen in the facility clearly shows that we can key into the organisation’s activities to get serviceable Agusta 109 and 139 as well as the Bell 412 helicopters. “Their facility is top-class and I believe that we will work together so that we can build the required facility to enable us do the job assigned to us. “By the time we fine-tune the terms of the partnership, it will clearly show why we believe that all hands must be on deck to effectively deal with insecurity.”
