The Chief Press Secretary to Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, yesterday urged the opposition to stop playing politics with the insecurity situation in Ibarapa and Oke-Ogun. He said most of the comments attributed to the opposition on the security situation missed the point due to pettiness, contempt and attempt to play to the gallery. “Their utter attempt at showmanship and unpatriotic conduct portray them as babies intervening in sensitive matters,” Adisa said.  He said if opposition elements were true lovers of the state, they should have used the occasion to demonstrate patriotism by empathising with the people and coming up with their own ideas on how to address the situation. He added that merely playing to the gallery only showcased them as ordinary politicians who do not think about the state, but solely about the next election. Adisa’s statement indicated that contrary to the picture painted by the opposition, especially the Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr. Sunday Dare, and some leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC), which suggested that the government did nothing about the Ibarapa security challenge, the Makinde administration took a number of steps..
