A lecturer at the Imo state University, Owerri, Emma Ogueri, who was kidnapped by gunmen on Friday night, has regained his freedom. Ogueri, a lecturer at the faculty of Social Sciences, was kidnapped at a Pharmacy, opposite All Seasons Hotel, new Owerri where he had gone to pick some drugs. He was said to be drinking with friends at a nearby pub and had gone to the pharmacy to buy anti-headache drugs when he was abducted. Eyes witnesses had told our correspondent that the kidnappers operated in police uniform. Our correspondent gathered that the academic who hails from the Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of the State was released Monday night A source said he was released after his family and friends allegedly paid an undisclosed sum as ransom. The source added that the police had trailed the kidnappers to the Awara- Omoku forest, following intelligence. It was the same hideout the Auxiliary Bishop of Owerri Catholic Archdiocese, Rev. Moses Chikwe, was taken to when he was kidnapped late December. The kidnappers had relocated with the lecturer when they sensed the presence of policemen in the creek, the source said. The presence of the policemen was said to have fast tracked the release of the lecturer as the kidnappers quickly concluded negotiation with the family and friends of Ogueri. “The kidnappers were demanding the sum of N3 million as ransom but the presence of policemen in the creek which forced the kidnappers to relocate with the lecturer to another hideout made them to quickly round off the negations with what was available”. When contacted, the Police Spokesperson in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, confirmed the release of the lecturer. He said the quick intervention of the police led to the release of the lecturer.
