Crystal Palace substitute Eberechi Eze punished bottom club Sheffield United with a superb solo goal as the Blades set another unwanted record. Jeffrey Schlupp had already opened the scoring with a deflected finish before the Ghana winger went off injured. That paved the way for Eze to come on and the former QPR forward doubled the lead before half-time, starting his run from inside his own half and finishing from 18 yards after evading a couple of challenges. Sheffield United offered little going forward and by failing to beat Palace in their 17th match of the season, Chris Wilder’s team set the record for the longest winless start to a Premier League campaign.  The Blades finished the game with 16-year-old substitute Antwoine Hackford on the pitch, the youngest player to appear for the club in the Premier League. After five games without a victory, this was a welcome return to winning ways for Roy Hodgson’s Palace with the highlight undoubtedly Eze’s exceptional goal. The 22-year-old forward has adapted quickly since making the step up from Championship club QPR on a five-year deal for £19.5m in August. Eze’s first Palace goal was a sublime free-kick against Leeds in November. His second was just as pleasing on the eye.
