Our thoughts are with you at this moment. We will always remember you in our prayers. “I pray that God Almighty imbue you with that unsurpassable strength to live through this difficult moment. “While praying that God grant the deceased eternal rest, we also beseech Him to also give all those that Mrs. Adebutu left behind the fortitude to bear this sudden loss.”
