  Former Nigeria international and current Lobi Stars Team Manager Barnabas Imenger has been reportedly rushed to the Federal Medical Center Makurdi for an undisclosed ailment. NationSport learnt that Imenger has been in and out of hospitals since last year before he was finally moved to Federal Medical Center in Makurdi. All efforts to speak with him has been unsuccessful but his Junior brother George Imenger confirmed that a team of medical doctors have swung into action by carrying out an extensive test to diagnose the actual cause of the ailment. “Series of tests have been carried out on him to know what is really happening to him and apply proper medication,” George to NationSport. George, who acknowledged the support of Lobi Stars board, disclosed that the club’s Vice Chairman Mike Idoko has been supportive and promised to continue to assist. “Any assistance coming for him this time will go a long way because my senior brother has been spending his entire monthly salary on his health since last year. He is a very reserve and humble personality and believes since he’s still earning a wage and allowances at Lobi Stars he can always take care of himself but the truth is that he is the breed winner in the family and a lot of responsibilities rest on his shoulder. The entire Imenger family in Makurdi is in prayer as Barnabas has been the head, father and breadwinner,” George said. However, his son, Nanen Imenger, who is also a Nigeria international expressed shock over this latest development as his father has never been so sick: “We’re praying for a divine intervention because since last year my father has been in and out of hospital and he has lost a lot of weight.”
