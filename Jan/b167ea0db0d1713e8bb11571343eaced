 He established Utiva as a one-stop-shop for technology education. His objective is to offer youths digital skill training in product management, design, data analytics, artificial intelligence and digital marketing. For Eyitayo Ogunmola, the Chief Executive, Utiva, the two challenges faced by education were access and quality. While these created a demand for educational institutes, the supply of good quality resources lagged far behind. Last year, Utiva launched five new programmes: product design, digital marketing, project management, career starters programme, and artificial intelligence. So far, these have helped over 3,000 students develop the capacity to thrive in the workforce. Also, the startup got into the Facebook Community Accelerator, Unleash, and MIT Solve. The firm won the JICA award. Supported by the Japanese Government, it launched the Nucleus, a self-paced learning device that is independent of the Internet, expanded into over 30 cities across the world, inaugurated Wunming Scholarship for persons living with disabilities and provided internship opportunities in partnership with Unilever. He added: “Our team grew to 25 amazing folks. We launched our Utiva Talent Fellowship programme. We established a fellowship programme that incubates young folks and equips them with the much-needed skills. We initiated the FeTech Scholarship for Women in Tech and launched our presence in the UK.” Ogunmola holds a Masters in Business Strategy, Leadership and Change from Heriot-Watt University. He is a MIT Solve Entrepreneur, 2020 Facebook Accelerator Leader, Halcyon Incubator Fellow, Global Good Funds Fellow; Chevening Scholar, and Atlas Corps Fellow, 2019 Unleash Talent.
