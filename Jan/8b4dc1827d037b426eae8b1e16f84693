The wheel of fortune is currently spinning and transforming lives around the country, courtesy of Pure Bliss Biscuit. It was a moment of joy for Chisom Udo, a middle-aged man who won N1, 000,000 in the ongoing Pure Bliss Millionaire promo. Chisom collected his prize at a special prize presentation ceremony which was held in Lagos recently. Sharing his experience, Chisom said the fact that he won N1 million in the promo was both a surprise and a dream come true. “I still can’t believe I won; I feel really special winning this. If anybody told me I’d be a millionaire just from eating a biscuit I love so much, I’d have told the person to stop cracking jokes. The best thing about my winning is that I got my confirmation message on my birthday and that filled me with so much joy and appreciation.” Presenting the cash prize of N1 million to Mr. Chisom, Area Sales Manager, OK Foods, Leonard Onyekuru, said, “Pure Bliss is delighted that winners across the country have expressed happiness that the prizes won in our promo will significantly transform their lives. For us as an organisation, nothing is more fulfilling than lighting up the day of our consumers. It’s truly a rewarding experience.”
