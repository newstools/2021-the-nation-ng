 Toyin Abraham has recounted her ordeal in the hands of street urchins during the shoot of her upcoming project, Ige. Abraham, in a video shared on her Twitter page, was seen negotiating with a group of men for her to use a particular location for a scene of the film. One of the street urchins in the video refused to collect the sum of N10,0000 which the actress offered and demanded a higher sum. “Area boys, after giving them money, they will still complain that the money is not enough and they want more. This is what we go through every time we are filming but we love them sha,” she captioned the video. Reacting to the incident, the Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu suggested that filmmakers should consider looking into getting state permits to shoot in areas of Lagos to avoid unnecessary harassment. In an interview with Channels TV, Sanwo-Olu noted that filmmakers could seek proper permission from private property owners. “When you begin to talk very specifically about ‘Omo onile’, what are the rules of engagement? So you want to go to a place, did you ask if there is a permit that you need to have? Do you know if it is a private property that you are into”, he said. Many filmmakers have continued to complain about the undue harassment meted out on them by street urchins or omo oniles during the shoot of their films.
