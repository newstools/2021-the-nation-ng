By Osagie Otabor, Akure Details have emerged on why Accountant General of Ondo State, Mr. Laolu Akindolire, is to spend another three months in office. Akindolire was supposed to retire this month but Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Monday approved his stay in office for another three months. A source said the extension of Akindolire tenure was because of the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance who would be due to retire next month, the time Governor Akeredolu is expected to dissolve his cabinet. “The man will be there for a new cabinet to be formed for proper handing over. Appointing a new AG now to change signatories with PS Finance and Commissioner for Finance twice in three months is unhealthy,” the source said. A statement by the Ondo Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, said Akindolire extended tenure would lapsed on April 12 when a new Accountant General of the State would be appointed. According to Ojogo, “Specifically, Mr. Governor’s move is in the overall interest of the smooth running of government, and to stave off unnecessary hitches as Government inches towards a period of transition within the 3 months period in question. “Governor Akeredolu wishes Mr. Akindolire well just as he charges him to discharge his duties with renewed vigour as always.”
