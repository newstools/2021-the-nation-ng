REAL Madrid forward Karim Benzema will face trial for his alleged involvement in blackmailing former France team-mate Matthieu Valbuena in a sex tape scandal, the Versailles prosecutors office has said. The striker is suspected of having pressured his former team-mate to pay blackmailers who threatened to reveal an intimate video in which Valbuena featured. The 33-year-old Benzema will stand trial on the charge of conspiracy to attempt blackmail. Four other people will also stand trial. Benzema denies any wrong doing. He has not played for France since the affair came to light while both players were in the France squad for the 2014 World Cup.
