The Global Initiative on Substance Abuse (GISA) has trained over 400 practitioners on evidence-based drug and substance abuse prevention in Nigeria. Among the trainees were school-based prevention specialists, workplace prevention experts as well as management and policy specialists drawn from different professions and organisations. Founder/Executive Director of GISA, Dr. Martin Agwogie, said this in a statement to mark the 2nd year anniversary of the commencement of the Universal Prevention Curriculum (UPC) for substance use disorders in Nigeria. He said: “Participants in our trainings cut across different professions and organisations such as government drug laws and regulatory agencies, ministries, private, faith based, youth and non-governmental organisations”. The GISA boss noted that despite the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, the organisation has continued to deliver evidence-based substance abuse prevention training using the virtual platform. He said GISA is in collaboration with local and international organisations in delivering evidence-base substance abuse prevention interventions such as the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), United States, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Colombo Plan Drug Advisory Programme of Sri Lanka among others. According to him: “We recently received a UNODC grant to deliver evidence-based substance abuse prevention interventions in selected secondary schools in Lagos state. “It will be the first of its kind with over sixteen thousand students, their parents and teachers in the schools as direct beneficiaries from the project. This is a mark of recognition of our expertise in delivering evidence-based interventions”. Agwogie noted that GISA’s training in 2021 will include evidence-based substance abuse prevention in the family and community which will also be extended to other African countries.
