 Chelsea sacked manager Frank Lampard on Monday after 18 months in charge, with former Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel hotly tipped to take over at Stamford Bridge. Lampard signed a three-year deal in July 2019, leading Chelsea to the FA Cup final and a fourth-placed Premier League finish in his first season in charge. Chelsea cruised into the last 16 of the Champions League and briefly topped the Premier League table in December but they have slumped to ninth after five defeats in eight matches – 11 points behind leaders Manchester United. Sunday’s 3-1 FA Cup fourth-round win against Championship side Luton was not enough to save the former England midfielder. The club said it had been a “very difficult decision” to part ways with the 42-year-old, who is their all-time record goal scorer. “We are grateful to Frank for what he has achieved in his time as head coach of the club,” Chelsea said in a statement. “However, recent results and performances have not met the club’s expectations, leaving the club mid-table without any clear path to sustained improvement.” In a rare public statement, the club’s Russian owner Roman Abramovich said: “This was a very difficult decision for the club, not least because I have an excellent personal relationship with Frank and I have the utmost respect for him. “He is a man of great integrity and has the highest of work ethics. However, under current circumstances we believe it is best to change managers.” Former PSG boss Tuchel, who was abruptly fired by the French champions in December, is in line to take over, it was widely reported.
