 YOUTHS of Bonny Local Government Area in Rivers State have begged Governor Nyesom Wike to save the council from incessant pirates’ attacks on travellers on the waterways. Hundreds of youths stormed the Government House in Port Harcourt on Thursday in a peaceful protest. They lamented that constant attacks of traders has deepened the hardship in Bonny as traders have stopped further transactions. A resident, Ms. Furo Boma, said the criminals attack and rape women at will, adding that the development caused food shortage in Bonny. She said: “Our women are raped by the day. We do not have food again. Any boat that is bringing food for our people will be hijacked by pirates. “People living on Bonny Island do not sleep with their eyes closed because of recurrent attacks by sea pirates. It has not been easy for us. We no longer travel home to meet our parents.” Boma urged the governor to intervene and restore sanity on the waterways as the development was beyond their local government council. She said: “We have come to meet with the governor. He is the only hope that we have because it is obvious noting is coming out from the local government. “We have come to see the governor because we voted for him. One of the reasons we voted for him is because he promised to give us security. We have come here today to say enough is enough. We came here with the consent of our fathers. They know we are here. The governor should save Bonny people from pirates. “We don’t want to take laws into our hands that is why we have come to ask the government to fight for us.”
