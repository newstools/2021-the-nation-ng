 Yaya Toure has commenced plans to secure his coaching badges with opportunities to lead young footballers at Queens Park Rangers and Blackburn Rovers. The four-time African Footballer of the Year is yet to find a new club to continue his career since he left Qingdao Huanghai in January 2020 after helping them gain promotion to the Chinese Super League. Last year, the 37-year-old midfielder joined League Two club Leyton Orient in training but he has now expressed his readiness to follow a similar path as his brother Kolo, who is an assistant coach to Brendan Rodgers at Leicester City. Toure, who won three Premier League titles during his eight-year spell at Manchester City, said he has been learning from youth coaches in the Championship and he has led some coaching sessions. “The coronavirus pandemic has made things difficult in a lot of ways – it was the reason I left Qingdao Huanghai in China at the start of 2020 – but it has given me the opportunity to learn,” Toure wrote in the Coaches’ Voice. “I have taken the chance to start doing my coaching badges and think about the next chapter. I’ve already made good progress in gaining my qualifications.”
