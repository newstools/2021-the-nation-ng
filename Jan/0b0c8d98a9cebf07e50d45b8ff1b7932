Bayero University Kano (BUK) through the Department of Gender Studies in collaboration with Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, Germany has trained 120 youths in Kano State on leadership development. The two-day training, which held at Convocation Arena, BUK, ended on Tuesday. Participants were undergraduates, drawn from different universities and other tertiary institutions. BUK Director, Department of Gender Studies, Professor Hassana Sani Darma, said the centre has been training youths on de-radicalisation, through series of roundtable programmes, which have been initiated by the centre to make the society better. She disclosed the training are supported by Germany’s Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, which has always backed the centre on issues of youth moral and skills development so that they can aspire for leadership positions. “The latest training focuses on enhancing youths’ enlightenment and mobilising them to actively participate in leadership roles,” she said. Dr Maikano Madaki of the Sociology department of the university said: “The training is targeted at Nigerian youths, and the essence is to see how their leadership skills can be developed. And areas where they have challenges, in terms of developing leadership potentials and skills, can be addressed. “Secondly, the training is designed to look at the effects of drug or substance abuse in the country and the extent to which substance and drug abuse is remarkably affecting the socio-economic and political development of the nation since many youths are involved in drug abuse. ‘’So, the round table discussion is to create awareness among the target groups who are basically the youths, so that they can go back to their respective locations and NGOs and send the same information as they develop leadership skills. This will help in controlling drug abuse among the youths in the country for qualitative leadership.”
