 Lagos Judicial Panel of Investigation and Restitution on SARS and Related Abuses yesterday summoned the Head of the state Task Force, Omotayo Ojo, to appear before it on January 27. The panel Chairman, Justice Doris Okuwobi, also ordered that hearing notice be issued to Ojo. Justice Okuwobi granted the request of counsel to the police, Cyril Ejiofor that the head of the task force be summoned before the panel. He said persons mentioned in Dr. Oludare Stephens’ petition before the panel are not under the control of the commissioner of police, but the state task force. The attention of the head of the Lagos task force is needed in a petition filed by Dr. Oludare Stephens against the Nigeria Police Force for abuses before the panel. Earlier, during resumed proceeding, counsel to the panel, Jonathan Ogunsanya, told members that Ojo was duly informed that the matter had been scheduled for hearing yesterday. Ogunsanya said he was surprised that he failed to appear before the panel despite that he informed him personally. Lagos State was represented at the panel by Olukayode Enitan, while the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) was represented by A. C.  Eze and Jennifer Esu.
