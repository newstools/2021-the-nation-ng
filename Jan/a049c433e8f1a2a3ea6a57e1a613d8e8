 NANTES head coach, Raymond Domenech has hinted that Super Eagles winger, Moses Simon is gradually getting back to shape after recovering from a thigh muscle strain. Domenech revealed that the Nigerian is coming back strongly and has begun his recovery from the knock. Moses has played 15 games for Nantes with two goals in the French League this season but he has missed the club’s last two games with Montpellier and Lens after a one minute cameo against Rennes in the first game of the year. “There is no particular problem. We had everyone in training. Moses Simon? He is coming back and trained normally,” Domenech said of the Nigerian in a chat with the club official website. The former French national team coach gave additional updates on the fitness of his other players: “As for Jean-Kévin Augustin, he is also coming back. He is in the group and also trains normally. It is better, afterwards, the real problem is that when there were the matches of the reserve, we could have seen him play. Nantes who are on an 11 game winless streak will slug it out with Metz at Stade Saint Symphorien on Sunday in search of the first elusive win that take them away from the 17th spot on the log with 18 points from 20 games.
