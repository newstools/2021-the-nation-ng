A High Court sitting in Kaduna has ordered the release of Zeenat, wife of Sheikh Ibrahim Elzakzaky, the leader of Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), for COVID-19 treatment.  Last Thursday, Mohammed, son of the IMN leader, said his mother, Zeenat, tested positive for COVID-19 at the Kaduna correctional centre, where he demanded for her release for treatment and authority refused. Femi Falana, counsel to El-Zakzaky, however, presented a medical report to back up his case for the release of Zeenat. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) asked the court to allow Zeenat receives medical treatment outside the correctional centre, according to measures put in place by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).  In the ruling delivered yesterday, the court, however, asked that Zeenat be moved to a government isolation facility to begin treatment immediately. The judge, Gideon Kurada, granted the request after Chris Umar, the prosecuting counsel, concurred with Falana’s submission. The Comptroller of Kaduna Correctional Service, Ibrahim Labbo Maradun, had Friday last week denied the report of Mrs. Zakzaky’s testing positive. He said the result of her test was still being awaited as at Friday. The test result obtained by The Nation, stamped by the Kaduna State Ministry of Health COVID-19 Laboratory on January 20, 2021, shows that the IMN leader’s wife is COVID-19 positive.
