Yoruba rights activist Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has said he cannot be intimidated into abandoning his quest for a Yoruba land free of bandits and kidnappers. Igboho had asked herdsmen in Igangan, Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State to leave within seven days following reports of the killing of some Oyo citizens. In a viral video, which surfaced Sunday afternoon, Igboho expressed his appreciation to prominent Yoruba leaders for speaking up at this critical moment. He said: “They (herders) cannot chase us away from our land. Our eyes are opened unless they want to kill us. “Don’t ridicule or abuse our leaders in Southwest, I swear with the gods of our land, they are also angry with the current situation and they are now speaking up “You can see the way all the Yorubas and other prominent Southwest leaders rose up in unison to say that you must not arrest Igboho. “It is quite sad that we are being maltreated, killed and our sisters/daughters get raped by killer herdsmen, we can’t go to farm or stream to carry out different activities. Enough is enough.”
