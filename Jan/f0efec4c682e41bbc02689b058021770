Katsina State governor, Aminu Bello Masari, on Saturday tasked journalists on accurate and objective reporting of security situations in the state. Masari, who gave the charge in Katsina during a one-day seminar organised by the State Government in collaboration with the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), also charged them to ensure varying and balanced report before publishing. He described the seminar as timely, considering the roles of the media in the fight against banditry, kidnapping and other forms of crimes in the state, saying it is necessary so as to enhance their capacity and remind them of their social responsibility. He said, “The media is a great tool for ensuring the security of any society, hence the need to always be cautious and ensure accuracy, devoid of deceit and the need to always fear Allah in reporting.” He decried the damages the new media is causing to the state and nation in the area of fake news and urged them to adhere strictly to the ethics of the profession. The Special Adviser on Security Matters to the Governor, Ibrahim Ahmad Katsina, described the seminar as timely and targeted at enhancing security of the state through professional journalism. Earlier, the NUJ Chairman, Comrade Tukur Hassan Dan Ali, informed the governor that journalists in the state are determined to adhere to the ethics of the profession and to support his administration.
