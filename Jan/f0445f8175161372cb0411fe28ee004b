Former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Prof Attahiru Jega has described the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari as “very disappointing.” He told Daily Trust the current administration has performed below the expectations of “so many Nigerians”. Jega, who was appointed as former President Goodluck Jonathan, was INEC chairman from 2010 to 2015. The former vice-chancellor of Bayero University Kano said although Buhari enjoys goodwill from many Nigerians, citizens are worried “about the direction the country is taking.” “He (Buhari) has disappointed so many people. He still has time to correct things if he has the capacity to do that. Frankly, his government has been very disappointing. “Governance has been very poor at the federal level and many of the states, that is why we are seeing challenges everywhere; whether it is insurgency, banditry, armed robbery or other things.”
