The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged that lack of commitment on the part of the Federal Government has been responsible for the spike in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic ravaging the country. The party flayed the government for not being proactive in checking the spate of the second wave of the pandemic, a situation it said, triggered the spread and consequent escalating death rate in the country. In a statement on Wednesday, its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, lamented the increasing number of deaths of Nigerians, including prominent citizens, on a daily basis from Covid-19, regretting that the government has remained lethargic with no concrete commitment for solution. The statement said: “The PDP is shocked that the Buhari administration did not make any budgetary provision in the 2021 Appropriation for the acquisition of essential therapeutics, including vaccines, even in the face of the heightened anxieties over the second wave of the pandemic in our nation. “It is indeed the height of leadership failure that the Federal Government has not been able to take a decision on the type and quantity of vaccines expected as well as ancillary facilities and associated logistics.” The opposition party said it’s distressing that the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has not demonstrated any capacity beyond mere announcement of figures of infected persons, deaths, recoveries, discharges and issues of local protocols.
