  The Executive Chairman of Kosofe Local Government at the weekend commissioned two blocks of refurbished classrooms in Oworonshoki and Ifako areas of the local government. The first, in Oworonshoki, is a block of five classrooms at Ayeroju Primary School, while the second is a block of seven classrooms at Ifako Nursery and Primary School. The CDC Chairman of Kosofe Local Government Area, who represented Council Chairman, Hon. Sofola, at Oworonshoki, appealed to the school authorities to make judicious use of the facilities, adding that the council chairman has done well by renovating the hitherto dilapidated classrooms. “He has made use of tax payers’ money judiciously. It makes this environment conducive for pupils to learn. When the environment is conducive, pupils will be ready to learn and the issue of cultism will not be in their mind.” At the commissioning at Ifako Nursery and Primary school, Ifako, the Vice-Chairman of the council, Hon. Omotuyi Awosola, who represented the Council Chairman, also appealed for good use of the facilities. Councillor representing the ward (C), Ibraheem Bakare Olawale, announced that the chairman came to prompt rescue of the situation after a heavy rainfall destroyed the old structure four months ago. The head teachers of the two schools; Mrs. Ogeyingbo Adesola Oludayo and Mr. Cletus Ifaribido reacting in separate presentations, expressed appreciation at the gesture and promised to protect and make good use of the facilities. An APC chieftain in Ifako, Chief Olukayode Onasanya, praised the council chairman for the renovation and called on the school management to ensure proper maintenance of the facility.
