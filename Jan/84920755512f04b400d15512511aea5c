 KOGI State House of Assembly Speaker Mathew Kolawole on Tuesday explained that Governor Yahaya Bello’s insistence that COVID-19 was a ruse was to ensure that the virus did not set the state’s economy backward. He said in Ilorin on Tuesday that “it is not that the governor is not accepting the fact that there is a virus called COVID-19. “He just wants us to know it is an advancement of malaria, which is not really a big deal. “That is why Kogi has refused to lockdown ever since the emergence of the virus because we don’t want what will negate our economy the more.’’ Kolawole spoke after the Correspondents Chapel of the Kwara Council of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) awarded him with a medal for his contributions to youth empowerment. He also told reporters that the Kogi legislature supported Bello’s presidential ambition to compensate the North Central geopolitical zone. Kolawole said since Nigeria came into being, no-one from the zone ever occupied the presidential seat. “So, it will not be a bad idea if we have a president from this geopolitical zone as all other zones have been represented either as president or vice-president,’’ Kolawole said. He added that the Assembly’s support for the governor was for the development of the country.
