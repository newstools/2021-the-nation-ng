 Luck may come the way of Okpo Community Secondary School in Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area of Enugu State as its newly inaugurated alumni association has vowed to intervene in the 43- year- old school. This is coming 38 years after the first set left the school, then Okpo Boys High School, in 1983. The need to intervene was part of resolutions reached at the association’s inaugural meeting held at Nicole’s Place, University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). Chairman of the association, Chief Sunday Ossai, said the interventions when achieved, would help upgrade the school to a greater height and impact positively on the current students. He recalled that the school was like an open field when they (the first set) were admitted, but hard work soon made Okpo a competition among other schools in Nsukka.  He added that many of the alumni had done well for themselves. “Boys are now men and we must begin to think how to impact on the school from which all of us benefited.  “I remember that during my graduation speech, I told my colleagues that the outside world is full of potentials and they should go forth and explore. “I thank God that many of us are alive to witness the materialisation of that admonition to go forth and explore as Okpo Boys products can be found in many parts of the world today doing well,” he said. Also, Chief Samuel Asadu, Igwe Ogadagidi and Igwe-elect of Edem community in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State, the first pupil to be admitted in the school, expressed joy over the decision. The United States-based nurse said he could not wait to give back to the school that made him. “I have been in different parts of the world, people always want to know where I was trained, and where I started from. “I have been blessed by God with great fortunes and had since been in the business of giving back to society hence, I am all out to ensure the success of the alumni association and the betterment of our common alma mater,” Asadu said.
