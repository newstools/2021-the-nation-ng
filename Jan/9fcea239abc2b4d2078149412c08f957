 FORMER House of Representatives member from Ebonyi State Lazarus Ogbee has debunked reports of rift with Governor David Umahi over the governor’s defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ogbee  represented Ikwo/Ezza South from June 2015 to November 2019 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ogbee refuted the report at Isu, Onicha Local Government Area, during the distribution of empowerment items to indigents by the Ebele and Anyi Chuks Foundation. The former lawmaker said Umahi remained his political father. He said: “Umahi has defected to the APC but he is still my political father and I, his son. We know where we have reached and cannot cross the bridge, but my relationship with him is presently personal.” Ogbee said he did not defect with Umahi to the APC because of his principles. “I cannot join the APC because I was robbed of my victory at the court. I knew I won that election clearly, was duly sworn-in and that was my second time at the House of Representatives. “I am coming again, maybe not for the House of Representatives, but in another position and definitely, cannot easily be short-changed.”
