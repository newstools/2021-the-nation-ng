Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed said on Friday that President Muhammadu Buhari made the best choices in the recent appointment of Service Chiefs. The Minister told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that the choice of appointment of service chiefs is the exclusive right of the President who has information about their competences and capabilities. “Based on available information at our disposal, the President has made the best choices,” he said. “These men are not new to the theatres of conflict. Almost all of them have served in one capacity or the other in the theatre. “Having served in the theatres of conflict, it will make their jobs easier. “They are not starting afresh and we hope that they will take off from where their predecessors stopped,” he said. The minister asked Nigerians to give the new service chiefs the support that they need to embark on their new journey. He also thanked the former service chiefs for their contributions to fighting insecurity in the country.
