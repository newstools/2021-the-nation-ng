The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had an advice for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday. The opposition party should to stop living in illusion. In its reaction to a remark by Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike that President Muhammadu Buhari should get set to hand over power to the PDP in 2023, the APC  said Nigerians have endorsed it as their  preferred party. The Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC, Senator James John Akpanudoedehe, said Wike and the PDP have since 2015 lost out in the political equation of the country. According to him, the governor and his state “are only living in illusion of a dream that cannot come to pass.” Akpanudoedehe said the claim that Nigerians want PDP back to power by 2023 was “not only laughable but an indication that the PDP and the likes of Gov. Wike are living in dream land.” The APC scribe noted that for two consecutive cycles of general elections and other off-cycle elections, the electorate rejected the PDP for the years of its misrule, adding that Nigerians will not want to be remembered of the trauma of the disaster of 16 years of misadventure of PDP in government. He said: “We would ordinarily have allowed PDP to wallow in its usual illusion – since its descent from power in 2015 – that ‘Nigerians desire their return to power;’ how laughable! “We are constrained to set the records straight because it borders on the collective sensibilities of Nigerians who have consistently and resoundingly proven in two consecutive cycles of general elections as well as other off-cycle elections, their outright rejection of the contraption called PDP and their (Nigerians) preference and endorsement of APC as the Party of choice for the majority of Nigerians.”
