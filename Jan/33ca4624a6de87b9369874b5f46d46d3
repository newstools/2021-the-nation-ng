 The Court of Appeal sitting in Ado-Ekiti has dismissed the suit challenging the conduct of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) ward congress in Ekiti by the party’s National Working Committee (NWC). Delivering her judgement in the suit no: CA/EK/57/2020 on Wednesday evening, Justice T.N Orji-Abadua, dismissed the appeal by a group loyal to Senator Biodun Olujimi against an earlier judgement of the Federal High Court sitting in Ekiti. The Federal High Court had, in its verdict in July 2020 dismissed the suit instituted against Haruna Manu-led congress panel and upheld the preliminary objection raised concerning the suitability of the case. The court also awarded N200, 000 cost against the plaintiff and their Counsel to be paid to the PDP, the 4th and 5th defendants on or before of September 1, 2020. The Olujimi’s faction, dissatisfied with the ruling, approached the Appellate Court, urging it to set aside the judgement, which favours former governor Ayodele Fayose camp.  In its judgement , the Appeal Court upheld the decision of the trial court and held that the case was not justiciable on the ground that it was a matter that emanated from intra-party affairs. Reacting to the verdict, Fayose through his media aide, Lere Olayinka, said that there was no victor, no vanquished, noting that the two factions belong to the same political family. He called on party’s members to see the ruling as only victory for everyone and a watershed in the quest for reconciliation in the party. He said: “To all PDP members, please see this a victory for all. No victor, no vanquished. We are in deep talks to reconcile all. We should refrain from provocative languages.” But, in her response, Olujimi through her media aide, Chief Sanya Atofarati said “we would only take it as judgement of man which does not represent that of Almighty God. “However our lawyers are reviewing the judgement and at appropriate time we will take a position on the matter”.
