 How the Occupational Safety and Health Association emerged The Association is legally registered in Nigeria and duly commenced its activities in Nigeria in December 2011with the collaboration of local and international partners and supporters in the region. It’s duly registered with Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and also the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Challenges One of the major challenges is awareness; a lot has to be done on the publicity of the Association. Secondly, funding , we need the government agencies ,ministries, private sectors to get to know more about what we do ,the advantages and then come into partnership with us We need adequate funding to drive the Association,  we’re here to ensure safety of workers and even safety all around the nation Agenda for Association One of my major goals is to develop the motives and agenda of the Association which is safety such as safety in workplaces, safety in schools, safety in our homes, safety in malls, marketplaces, religious places etc. Also to push forward the Association, take it to greater heights and achieve more successes than ever recorded. Addressing workplace hazards My Association will be doing a lot to address workplace hazards in terms of partnering with private firms, government agencies, parastatals, ministries in getting proper trainings on occupational safety which will not only become useful to them in their place of work but also in their day to day activities .Role of occupational and health safety in nation-building Occupational and health safety have a huge role to play in nation building, we need to get officials trained and educated from time to time. Only a nation who has its workers secured and safe at work can function at its peak.
