 SPEAKER of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, on Saturday paid a condolence visit to the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Nuhu Ahmed Bamalli. The condolence visit was in respect of two prominent princes in the emirate, Alhaji Bashir Aminu (the Iyan Zazzau), and the Talban Zazzau, Abdulkadir Iya-Pate, who died on Friday. The Speaker, who visited the emir’s palace in Zaria, Kaduna State with a delegation of more than 20 members of the House, including the House Leader, Rep. Alhassan Ado Doguwa. prayed that God would grant the souls of the late prince’s eternal rest. The speaker also seized the opportunity to congratulate Bamalli over his elevation to the throne, saying that although he was not physically present at the installation ceremonies, he was with the emirate in spirit. He said: “I was here with my heart, with my soul. The only thing that was not here on that day was my body. “May you grow over us your subjects, and that includes me, with wisdom and with fatherly love. “Having said that, it is ironic that at the same time, I am coming to offer commiseration on the loss of two prominent members of your council. “I only heard yesterday, then I was given the details this morning. What can we say? May Allah grant them eternal rest. May their souls rest in peace.”
