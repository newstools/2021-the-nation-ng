 INDIGENOUS students of Ondo State in tertiary institutions might have a cause to smile this year as the sum of N209m has been earmarked in the stateâ€™s 2021 budget for the payment of scholarships and bursary awards. Last year, the National Association of Ondo State Students (NAOSS) protested severely calling on Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to fullfill his promise of disbursing bursary to indigenous students. National President of NAOSS, Kikiowo Ayoade, had said that previous administrations paid bursaries to students until 2015 and that over 6,427 Ondo State students have completed their registration. Also, the near moribund Ondo State Fire Service would be boosted with the planned purchase of two fire trucks for the sum of N170m. The N174.873bn Ondo 2021 budget has provision for N69.915 for capital projects and N79.084 for recurrent expenditure. Speaking at a press briefing in Akure, Ondo State Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Mr. Emmanuel Igbasun, said the sum of N468m would be used for waste collection across the state. Igbasun who gave a breakdown of the 2021 budget said the payment of pension to former Governors and Deputy Governors would continue as the sum of N10.916bn has been set aside for payment of pensions and gratuities.
