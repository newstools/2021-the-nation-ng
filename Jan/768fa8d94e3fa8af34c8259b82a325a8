 The CAF Confederation Cup first round second leg encounter between Rivers United of Nigeria and South African opponents Bloemfontein Celtic has been called off, CAF has confirmed. The South African team were unable to make the trip to Nigeria for the tie slated for Port Harcourt after efforts to secure a waiver to fly into Nigeria from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) were unsuccessful. In a response to a letter written to CAF by former River United media officer, Sammy Wejinya, CAF stated that no game will take place today, stressing that the case will be submitted to the competent body within CAF to decide on the appropriate course of action to follow. The  message reads: “Hello Dear. No the game will not take place. We hereby inform you that the case will be submitted to the competent body within CAF to decide on the appropriate course of action to follow. “The decision shall be communicated in due time. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.” Rivers United won the first leg in South Africa 3-0 a fortnight ago. The overall winners of this match-up will advance to the final playoff leading to the group stage of the Confederation Cup. Yet , Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has pleaded with the CAF to stage the match in any of the Nigeria’s  neighboring countries with a little less stringent COVID-19 protocols. In a letter signed by the NFF General Secretary, Dr.  Mohammed Sanusi and directed to the Acting General Secretary CAF, NFF said the request for waiver for the Bloemfontein Celtic contingent to Nigeria has been declined by the authorities. “Please understand that, the health policy as put in place by the Nigeria health authority is aimed at controlling the spread of the already number of Covid-19 infection in Nigeria and not aimed at South African nationals,” NFF said.
