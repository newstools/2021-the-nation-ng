 PRESIDENT of the Creative Industry Group, Felix Duke, has rejoiced with all members of the group for crossing over to 2021 while restating the group’s achievements. Expressing heartfelt condolences to all who are grieving due to the loss of loved ones, Duke prayed for the soul of the deceased. Duke went on to reel out the achievements of the CIG in 2020 despite the global flood of unpleasant events. According to Duke, the CIG launched the CiG Welfare Insurance Scheme, The CIG Pacific Estate, collaborated with Empress Madani on establishing the World Cinema Academy in Lagos. The group’s president also said two successive free skill acquisition and entrepreneurial training were conducted in the same year while courtesy visits were made to entertainers who have contributed immensely to the growth of the creative industry. “We are grateful to all and sundry who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to keep the CIG up and running,” he said in a statement. Continuing, he said, “Despite the hassles that kicked started the year, we remain unfettered in our hopes that we all shall surmount every challenge and make good progress.” He also said that all hands are on deck as the group prepares for the creative Industry Festival 2021.
