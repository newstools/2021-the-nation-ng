Social media was agog on Thursday over images of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar receiving a jab of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Dele Momodu on Twitter, shared pictures showing Atiku receiving the jab in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Momodu’s tweet read: “Former Vice President, the Wazirin Adamawa, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar receives Pfizer Covid-19 jab vaccination.” Atiku’s spokesman Paul Ibe confirmed the news, according to TheCable, saying: “The importance of the #COVID-19 vaccine in mitigating the effect of the coronavirus cannot be overstated, particularly in Africa and Nigeria. Yesterday (Wednesday), as part of the mass vaccination programme, Atiku Abubakar received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.” Pfizer vaccine is the first to be granted emergency use authorisation by the World Health Organisation (WHO). According to Pfizer and BioNTech, it is 90 per cent effective. Here are few social media reactions culled from Twitter: @rotifassy said: “As correctly predicted few months ago. This “vaccine tourism” will soon become the norm for Nigerian elites.” @Ndubuisi_Rita said: “Protecting himself and forgetting the masses that he will need their votes.” @sunybest4 said: “Plenty of Nigerians have no access to good vaccines. The rich will always be the cheat.” @45thchucks said: “He should’ve received it here in Nigeria to show his patriotic Nigerian spirit. Nigerian leaders always prefer overseas medical treatment while ignoring Nigerian infrastructure and institutions.” @Kachizone said: “What’s the president waiting for? Isn’t it leadership by example?” @Bodeowoeye said: “I learnt Alhaji @atiku ran to Dubai to go receive Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at the expense of his teeming #SoroSoke followers. Again, the former VP left his followers in the cold, to fight for their lives themselves, all alone. Where is Alhaji Atiku sense of patriotism?”
