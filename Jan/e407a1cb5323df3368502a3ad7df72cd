A 20-year-old girl Fatima Usman has cried over incestuous act being committed by her father, a staff of the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo. Fatima, who spoke in a viral video, said the sexual act with her father began a long time ago. She said whenever she refused to sleep with her father he would send her out of the house even at midnight. Fatima stated her mother does not check whether she sleeps in the house or not anytime her father sends her away for refusing his sexual advances. In her words: “My father has been sleeping with me for a very long and whenever I refuse he would send me out of the room. “If I say I will voice out, he would be threatening to kill me. He would bring out a knife and show me that if I tell anybody he would kill me. “My mother did not bother to check on me whether I slept in the room or not. Anytime my father sent me out, and I slept outside, my mother would have slept off, she did not know what was happening.” She said she want the state government to help her get justice. A man who claimed to be an in-law to Fatima’s father said the family intervened in the matter by asking her father to perform some rituals in line with their customs and tradition. He said: “‘ When we heard about the matter, we went to their house and Fatima’s father confessed to the act but pleaded that it was the devil that pushed him. So we took the matter to our village in Delta State and the family said he had committed sacrilege. “So he was asked to bring some items as atonement for the incestuous act and he provided those items, which include tubers of yam, goat, local gin among other. “After that the elders in the village warned the girl not to return to her father’s house that she should be staying with me.” He said the matter was reported at a police station and the father was arrested but granted bail. Ondo Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, said he was yet to be briefed about the matter.
