The Vice-President of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 elections, Gov. Peter Obi has denied securing an injunction to restrain the probe of the State Anti -Robbery Squad in Anambra State. A statement signed by his Special Assistant on media and Publicity, Mr. Valentine Obienyem, reads: “I saw the news that Mr. Peter Obi has secured a court injunction to stop the probe of SARS. “Kindly disregard the news as fake. There is absolutely no truth in the news. “Mr. Peter Obi is not SARS and could not have secured any injunction in a matter where he has no locus. For your information, it is SARS and not Mr. Peter Obi that is being probed. It is only enemies of progress that try relentlessly to link Obi to the probe that he is not part of.”
