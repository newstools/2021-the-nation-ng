An unidentified young man believed to be in his 20s was crushed to death by suspected commercial driver a few hours to the crossover night in Warri South local government area, Delta state. It was learnt that the identity of the driver could not be ascertained, but an eye witness at the scene of the incident, said the deceased was among those throwing fireworks as part of the celebration when he was knocked down. The driver, according to the witness escaped with his car for the fear of being lynched by angry mob who went after the car but couldnâ€™t get it but rather throwing stones at it. Speaking further, the witness said the throwing of fireworks on the streets of Warri and across the state was against the directives of the Delta state government to abstain from it.
