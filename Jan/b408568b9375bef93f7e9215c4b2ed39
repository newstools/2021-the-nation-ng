There was pandemonium in Abuja as one person was reportedly killed during a clash between the police and members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) popularly known as Shiâ€™ites in Abuja. The group on Tuesday staged the protest near National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) junction in Maitama with placards to demand the unconditional release of their leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife from Kaduna Correctional Center. Trouble started when a detachment of armed policemen sighted the protesters near Transcorp Hilton junction fired teargas canisters and live bullets to disperse them. One of the protesters was shot in the stomach in the process, leaving many others with injuries. The situation caused pandemonium in the area as motorists and passersby scampered for safety to avoid being caught in the saga. The area was also crowded as motorists were seen following alternative routes. Kaduna State High Court in 2019 ordered the Department of State Services (DSS), to transfer the Sheikh EI-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenah to the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Kaduna. Kaduna State government is prosecuting the IMN leader and his wife for alleged culpable homicide, unlawful assembly and disruption of public peace and among other charges.
