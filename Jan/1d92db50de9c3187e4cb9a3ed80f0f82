 DESPITE the influx of up and coming stars in the music industry, some still strive to deviate from the norm by doing things differently. Nigerian music act and record label owner, Omotayo Otunuga aka Felaman has announced plans to drop his new single ‘Orijo’ alongside a 15-track album. Currently signed to his Magik Records, the afro-fusion artiste and architect revealed this at the launch of the label and album. Speaking of his music, Felaman stated that everything he does is spiritual and original. He further explained that music is his life and he is excited to be making music for the world to listen to. “Music is my life and it’s something I’ve been craving since I was a kid and I’m happy I have the chance to do music. I have been doing music since I was young, I love to sing, so when I got out of secondary school I felt I should do music, but I didn’t have the chance to do music.” On his early influences, the young artiste revealed that initially, he didn’t get approval from his mother, because she really wanted him to go to school, being a principal at the time, she was the one who told him music would always be available for him at the right time. He explained that even though his label is young and new, he is aware of what needs to be done. “I’m actually new in this but it doesn’t mean I don’t have an idea of what I’m doing. I believe my songs are very good and with better promotion, I will get there. Magik Records is all about spirituality and originality. So expect the unexpected from us.” Also commenting on the inspiration for his music, he shared that he draws inspiration from his personal life, and many of his fans understand the message in his songs deeply.
