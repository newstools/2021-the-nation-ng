Two petitioners, who brought a case of police brutality to the Kwara State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on #EndSARS protest sitting in Ilorin, on Monday urged the panel to recommend the violation of their rights by the police. The petitioners, Shuaib Oba Jawando and Alhaji Kehinde Gobir, claimed in their petitions that they were arrested and interrogated for alleged involvement in the April 5, 2018 Offa bank robbery. They also claimed that they were interrogated by men of the disbanded Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS) under dehumanising conditions at Ilorin and Abuja offices. Giving his final submission before the panel, the petitioners’ counsel, Abdullahi Jimba, said what was written in the respondent’s (police’s) address was not related to the petition. The counsel said the respondent’s address is aimed at attacking the territorial jurisdiction of the panel, urging the members to discountenance the address in its entirety. Earlier, the respondent’s counsel, Adekunle Iwalaye, sought relief of the panel to dismiss Jawando’s and Gobir’s petition in its entirety. The panel Chairman, retired Justice Tunde Garba, said the petitions would be dealt with.
