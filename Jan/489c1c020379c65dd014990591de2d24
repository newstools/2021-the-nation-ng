  Unbeaten Ii the last two matches for TC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell; Quadri Aruna’s efforts could not save his team from losing to Bremen in the week 13 of the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL). Being the second defeat in the last 48hours, TTC Fulda were on the receiving end yesterday against their host Bremen with Swedish super star Mattias Falck being the match winner for the host in their 3-1 win over Aruna and his teammates. Relying on their 3-2 win in the first leg when Fan Bo Meng surprisingly defeated Falck but the permutation of TTC Fulda in the away match failed to materialize as Meng was beaten convincingly 3-0 by the Swedish. German international Ruwen Filus who in recent time has found his form,  failed to deliver when it mattered as he was defeated 3- 0 (11- 9, 11- 6, 11- 9) by Bremen’s Kirill Gerassimenko to give the host 2-0 lead. Just like he tried to do on Friday against Grünwettersbach, Aruna delivered again with an overwhelming 3-0 (8-11, 12-14, 7-11) win over Hunor Szöcs to put the tie at 2-1 while  Filus failed in the decider against  Fulda to give the home team 3-1 overall win. A disappointed Aruna described the defeat as unfortunate. “We were just unlucky today because we had our match plan laid out for the tie but things just went awry today. We hope we can get back into contention to escape relegation now that we are in 10th position in the league,” Aruna said.
