Flag-bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the 2019 governorship elections in Ebonyi State, Senator Sunny Ogbuoji, is not about to relinquish control of the ruling party’s structure to new entrant, Governor Dave Umahi, without a fight. When supporters of the governor allegedly jubilated over a news item suggesting the readiness of Ogbuoji to dump APC and join another party, the former senator representing Ebonyi South Senatorial District wasted no time in telling those who cared to listen that he was going nowhere. Sentry gathered that the former Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, who has not attended any of the party and government function called by Umahi since the latter joined APC, has vowed not to allow the governor take over the party ‘just like that.’ Ogbuoji and Umahi contested the 2019 governorship election which the governor won. Supporters of the senator are already announcing his preparedness to seek the number one office again amidst rumours that Umahi has a preferred candidate. “Ogbuoji is not leaving the APC for anybody. When nobody saw APC as a worthy political platform in Ebonyi, he moved there and gave the party some bite. Now some new comers are out to grab the structures ahead of 2023. We will not leave the house we built. We are here to stay and Ogbuoji will surely contest the 2023 guber election on the platform of the APC,” a party source stated. Already, the Ebonyi State APC Caretaker Chairman, Stanley Okoro-Emegha,is making moves to forestall possible intra-party crisis being between the two camps. He recently visited Ogbuoji at his Edda country home and assured him of the readiness of Umahi to work with all chieftains of the party.
