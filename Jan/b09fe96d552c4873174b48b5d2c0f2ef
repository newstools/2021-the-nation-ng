The year 2020, no doubt is a trying time, but for fashion and lifestyle blogger, Amber Rowan, it has been a positive year. “The year has been a trying one for most people. However, I have seen and utilised opportunities that counted as valuable experience for me,” she claims.
Continuing, the blogger, known popularly online as Ambsrowan, further discloses: “I have learned so much about myself and what I value. I have used this time to channel creative energy and thinking.” Despite the unprecedented disruption to economic and social activities, Ambsrowan can still claim a couple of achievements even as the year gradually draws to an end. “I have been able to finalise my plans for and designs of my activewear collection which will be unveiled early in 2021,” she reveals. Looking back, Ambsrowan appraised how far she had progressed from a child whose short-term ambition was to work as cabin crew to a young lady who, although didn’t have a long term dream, direction or idea, but does not hesitate to snap up travelling opportunities to broaden her horizon. “I always knew I wanted to take control and have my own business or product,” she affirms. On how she eventually found her passion, she avows: “Training has always been a big part of my life as a hobby, something I have a natural interest in. Girls have taken the gym floor by storm and I find that so empowering.” READ ALSO: She continues: “During the lockdown, I found life somewhat difficult without the gym, but I found new motivation which led me to shop online for new active wears and eventually I started research about materials for my own brand.” Of her plan for the future, Ambsrowan discloses: “I plan to broaden my collection, either within the fitness industry or loungewear everyday fashion.” She adds: “In 2021, I hope to launch my activewear collection making a statement in that industry, and I also hope to be more creative with social media posts, and concentrates on driving that growth.”
