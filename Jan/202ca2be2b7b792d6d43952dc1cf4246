 THE Federal Government has nominated Dr. Paul Adalikwu,  director, Maritime Safety and Security, Federal Ministry of Transportation, as the candidate for the Secretary-General of the Maritime Organisation for West and Central Africa (MOWCA). Adalikwu’s nomination, which got President Muhammadu Buhari’s nod, means that for the first time, Nigeria is indicating interest to produce the head of the 45-year-old organisation.

The Nigerian candidate is at the fore of efforts to establish a Regional Maritime Development Bank (RMDB) to be hosted by Nigeria. This multilateral financial institution is expected to address the  challenges of funding for maritime related commercial projects and deepen the regions’ capacity to harness the benefits of the blue economy. Adalikwu, an alumnus of the University of Calabar, also holds a Doctorate Degree in Public Administration and Management from Hamlin’s University, St Paul, Minnesota, United States.
