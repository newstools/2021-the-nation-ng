 US-based Nigerian actor and Instagram comedian, Ibraheem Bolaji Lawal aka Ibadan boy has said making a comedy skit involves dedication and information. In a  chat, Ibadanboy said:”It requires a lot of commitment, dedication and being informed about current events to be able to deliver efficiently to my audience not just something to laugh about but also pass across important messages through my comedy.” The comic actor says he draws inspiration from happenings around him and his influences while growing up. “I gain inspiration from current happenings in my environment and the world at large, personal experiences I had from the hood while growing up.” Reflecting on his journey to stardom, the comedian stated that fame has only made him better.  Ibadanboy also said that he has only gained from the positive side of fame. “I remain absolutely who I am but if there is anything fame has changed in me, it would be learning to be more patient and tolerant”, he said. “Comedy and acting as I said before has taught me to be more tolerant, humble, and respectful. And to God be the glory I’ve gained a lot of fanmily through this platform and also met a lot of wonderful people.” Recounting his early days as a content creator when friends talked him down from his chosen career, he said, “At the beginning of my comedy career, a childhood friend of mine called me razz and lot of friends even kept away from me because of my style of comedy ‘acting a local’ but thank God today the rejected stone is now the cornerstone. However, I never pay attention to such energy as it is a distraction that is expected en-route every road to success”.
