A Coalition of civil society groups has been told by a governor in the Northeast to drop the idea of promoting him as a possible presidential candidate in 2023. Sources say the campaigners had gone all the way from Abuja to the governor’s state to inform him of their readiness to tour the nooks and crannies of the country and garner support for his ambition. Sentry gathered that the group read about the governor’s alleged interest in the race somewhere and wanted to quickly “join the line.” But an aide of the governor revealed that not only did the governor, a former chief executive in the Federal Capital Territory who also served as a senator in the past, refused to grant the coalition audience. He also sent word to them that he is not interested in the race. “In fact, he told them he will be seeking a second term as governor of his state. When contacted by Sentry, the group’s chairman declined to speak on the matter but said his coalition is free to support anyone else come 2023. Whichever way to look at it some schemers clearly chose the wrong target.
