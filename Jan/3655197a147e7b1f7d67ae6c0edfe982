 Ex-Gunner Mesut Ozil has yet recalled the magic moment of former Super Eagles captain Austin Jay Jay Okocha during his days at Turkish giants Fenerbahce. Okocha joined the Turkish club in 1996 following the relegation of Eintracht Frankfurt to the 2. Bundesliga. In his two seasons with the team, he amassed 30 goals in 62 appearances, many of them coming from direct free kicks, which became something of a trademark for him at the club. It was here that he acquired Turkish citizenship as Muhammet Yavuz . Ozil who joined Fenerbahce this week after securing a release from his Arsenal contract, has yet spoken in glowing terms about Okocha’s days with Fener. “When I was a child, I remember being with someone who was supporting Besiktas and I was supporting Fenerbahce. I remember this and it will stay the same forever!” said the German. “While I was watching Fenerbahce, I liked Jay-Jay Okocha a lot for his playing style, and as for the team right now I’m really looking forward to playing with Dimitris Pelkas as we play in the same position. He’s a very talented footballer. “Of course I believe Fenerbahce are contenders to be champions every season, and hopefully we’ll do it as soon as possible. The dream is to play in the Champions League. I’ve been used to playing under pressure, and I know there will be pressure here too. “I’ve played with big clubs but Fenerbahce is something else for me. I appreciate the club so much and hopefully everything will be beautiful.”
