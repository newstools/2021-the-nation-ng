Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has charged Civil servants in the state not to see retirement from civil service as a route to death or terminal point but a new beginning of life to greatness. Masari, who gave the counsel while swearing-in six Permanent Secretaries into the state’s civil service at Government House Katsina, also noted that the new appointees deserved the appointment, considering their vast experiences in civil service. He further maintained that his administration is carefully appointing competent personalities into appropriate places in order to ensure accountability in governance adding that they were not expected to fail in service delivery. He said; “government is also gender-sensitive in all its appointments, ensuring balanced and well-represented administration. “We have many who might be qualified but not involved, you have to be qualified and be involved, I hope women will be forthcoming to see themselves as equal partners, not subordinate partners because governance is not about gender inequality but about gender equality and fairness. “For those of you who were in Civil service and think retirement is next to a death sentence, you better think twice, because retirement may be the beginning of new life for those who are determined and do not lose hope in their creator.” The newly appointed Permanent Secretaries include; Musa Abdu Dankama, Usman Isiyaku Dutsinma and Sule Musa, Mohammad Bilyaminu Albaba, Abdulhamid Garba and Maimuna Leko.
