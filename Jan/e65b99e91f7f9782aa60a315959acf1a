West Ham have agreed a deal to take Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard on loan for the remainder of the season. Lingard is expected to have his medical in Manchester before travelling to London to complete the move. If the deal is completed and Lingard is registered by midday on Friday, he will be available to make his debut against Liverpool on Sunday. Lingard has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford, failing to make a Premier League appearance this season, and has been looking to secure a move away to get more first-team minutes. It is understood Newcastle and West Brom approached Lingard’s representatives about taking the out-of-favour England international on loan, but the 28-year-old rejected their offers. The total cost of a potential deal is thought to be more than £3m, taking into account the loan fee and Lingard’s wages. United triggered a one-year extension on Lingard’s contract, which now runs until the summer of 2022, to protect his value ahead of a potential transfer.
