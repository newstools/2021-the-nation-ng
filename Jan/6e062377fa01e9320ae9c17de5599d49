Nigeria arm Chief Financial Officer & Chief Data Officer, Ngozi Ola-Israel, who spoke along with nine speakers from three continents at its just-concluded Data Science Week 2020 Hackathon event, explained that the challenge was geared towards driving productivity by empowering the employees of AXA Nigeria with relevant data analytics and machine learning skills needed for them to be more effective in their daily task, thereby bringing more value to the business. Supported by Zindi Africa, the hackaton  is a private challenge event on data analytics opened to only AXA Mansard employees.The challenge, which lasted for four days had 21 data scientists enrolled and four on the leader-board. Three winners were announced by Tekedia Institute, a United States-based institution with focus on business management and leadership development. While thanking the participants, organisers, and leaders on board, she said the company will continue to take active steps to use data analysis to make a sustainable impact in the insurance space. The Hackathon Challenge aimed to see how a hypothetical company could use her employees’ data between the first three years to give insight into why employees were leaving the company.
