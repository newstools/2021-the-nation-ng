The National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF) have warned that it will tackle some government agencies like the Standard Organisation (SON) and National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC). NAGAFF blamed the agencies for frustrating some stakeholders. He said some agencies frustrated port operations last year. National Coordinator, 100 percent Compliance Team, NAGAFF, Ibrahim Tanko, lamented that operations of the two agencies through samples collection from consignments at the Lagos seaports, had made the nation to lose a whooping N6billion daily, adding that the process negates trade facilitation. Tanko, who frowned at the activities of personnel from the two agencies of government, threatened that the compliance team would engage, resist and interrogate their operations from next month, in a bid to promote trade facilitation and boost government revenue drive. He reiterated that 100 percent Compliance Team would ensure that samples that were subjected to laboratory test by the agencies must be returned to the shippers, accusing personnel of SON and NAFDAC for illicit practices. On customs operations, he affirmed that issues of multiple alerts and Customs Intelligence Units interception of consignments at the seaports in Lagos would be tackled, noting that letters had been written to the Area Controllers of Apapa and Tin Can Island Port. Tanko stressed that freight forwarding subsector will experience a huge turnaround of vesselÂ  but urged the agencies of government to collaborate with the practitioners.
