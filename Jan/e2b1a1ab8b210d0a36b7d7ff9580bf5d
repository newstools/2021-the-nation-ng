The acting chairman of Warri South Local Government Area (LGA), Dr. (Mrs.) Minnie Igbrude, has appealed to security chiefs in the council area to support her administration like they did to the immediate past Dr. Michael Tidi-led government for peace to continue. Igbrude who is the director of personnel management of the Council made the appeal Thursday when she led some top officers of the council on a working visit to security chiefs with the area. She noted that their support will help to consolidate the existing peace in Warri South. Those in her entourage include the council’s treasurer, Mr. Ugborugbo Moses; assistant director of administration, Mr. Geoffrey Anamali; the chief admin officer-in-charge of security schedule, Misan Mabiaku and image-maker, Mr. Ebule Anthony Metsese. Expressing gratitude to the security personnel for contributing to the relative peace across the oil city, Dr. Igbrude, enjoined them to synergize with her administration. The Police Area Commander in Warri, ACP Abubakar Argungun, the Assistant Director of DSS Warri, Asibong Eteng and DPO Police ‘A’ Division Warri, CSP Ezekiel Onyeke, were among Security Chiefs visited by the new Warri South Council boss. The Warri Area Commander, ACP Argungun, described the visit as a mark of recognition and respect for the Police as an institution. He said, “our relationship with Warri South Council is very cordial. The immediate past Chairman supported us with the necessary information and I am sure yours won’t be any different. Your visit has shown that you have the capacity to deliver in peacebuilding and sustenance.”
