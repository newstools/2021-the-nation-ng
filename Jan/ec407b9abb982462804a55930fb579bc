 AGE notwithstanding, the thought of losing a loved one is something everyone dreads as we always wish our loved ones never depart from us. Benue billionaire, Terry Waya, recently lost his mother, Mama Monica Atese Waya, at the age of 80. Sharing her obituary post, Waya wrote: “Farewell mama, we love you but God loves you most.” Although the details of the burial have not been made public, well-wishers have been sending condolences to the businessman and his family and plans are in top gear to give the late woman a befitting ceremony. As a known socialite, all eyes will be on Waya to give a colourful burial to his mother and it is expected that all his friends will storm Benue.
