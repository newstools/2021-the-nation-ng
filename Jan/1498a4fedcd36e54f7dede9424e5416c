About 13 groups of ex-militant leaders have warned the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) against disengaging youths who went through duly established recruitment process and received employment letters from the commission. The ex-agitators at the weekend lambasted some groups, who they said were recruited to attack youths agitating for their rights, following their earlier outcry against what they described as plans to disengage them. The leaders, under the auspices of the Coalition of Niger Delta Transparency Advocates (CNDTA), described those attacking them as selfish, wicked and anti-patriotic to the Niger Delta struggle saying such outburst remained the reason for the poor state of the region. The leaders’ position was signed by Oghenekaro Duku, Watchdogs for Truth and Good Governance (WTGG); Ebi Ogolo, Graduates of the Niger Delta Movement (GNDM); Peter Johnson, Giant Strides of Niger Delta Force (GSNDF) and Amadi Frederick, Niger Delta People’s Movement (NDPM), among others. The coalition insisted the NDDC must absorb persons, who went through the commission’s recruitment process and were issued employment letters only to be abandoned by the commission. They said: “These qualified sons and daughters of the region were duly issued letters of employment and was well documented. “As we speak their respective files are in the Human Resources Department of the commission. The Director, Mr Silas Anyanwu is aware of this and can confirm this indisputable fact. “It would be recalled that this was exactly the same attitude displayed by the commission in respect of nonpayment of benefits to the 2019 NDDC Scholarship beneficiaries. They virtually had to protest abroad for what was due to them. “Let it be known that as a coalition saddled with the vision of speaking for the oppressed in the Niger Delta region, we shall not watch the brains of the region be intimidated and shortchanged all because they haven’t resorted to violence.”
