Gunmen have invaded Peremabiri community in Southern Ijaw Local Government of Bayelsa State. They torched over 20 houses. The hoodlums, who were said to have invaded the community in about 50 speedboats on Sunday, were allegedly on a mission to take over the community from an ex-militant leader, Paul Eris, popularly called Ogunboss. Sources alleged that the gunmen drove away residents suspected to be loyal to Ogunboss and took over  the town. A source said:  “As I speak with you, many people are still hiding in the bush and many houses have been burnt down. “The gunmen came in over 50 speedboats, shooting indiscriminately. They gained entrance into the community. People had no other option but to run into the bush. “We learnt that the gunmen have vowed to remain in the community and ensure that Ogunboss and his followers never return there. “I was told that the Christmas day attack on Ogunboss’ house was to drive him out of the town. And today’s attack is aimed at taking control of the community.” The government has not made a statement on the invasion. Police spokesman Asinim Butswat promised to get back to our correspondent after getting details from the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the area.
