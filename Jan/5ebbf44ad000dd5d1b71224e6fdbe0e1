 Genesis Group – owners of Genesis Cinemas – have kicked off 2021 with the opening of a French-themed restaurant. The new French-designed restaurant is situated on Adeola Odeku, Victoria Island Lagos. The new outlet registered itself as the 23rd outlet of the total numbers of Genesis Restaurant. Speaking on the new opening, Genesis Founder and Group Managing Director, Dr. Nnaeto Orazulike, shared the vision behind this location saying, “The Genesis experience is anchored on exceptional delivery of style and taste. When deciding to open our Adeola Odeku outlet, we had the Lagos professional in mind. From the opening hours of 7:00 am to 10:00 pm every day of the week, to our delivery services and cost-friendly tasty meals, you can dine in style without breaking the bank.” With the kitchen expected to be run by the dynamic culinary masters, Chef Toun (Dubai) and Chef Ayo (Nigeria), the newly launched outlet has the stunning interior designed by Patrick Norguet, the renowned French designer acclaimed for the redesign of McDonald’s on the Champs Élysées in Paris. The project was exquisitely managed by the awarding-winning Dakota Design (South Africa) and Harcourt Aduke Associates (Nigeria). The modern fit-out of the building was executed by Desmo UK (United Kingdom) and the external design flawlessly done by Architect Chuka Okolo of PDT Consulting (Nigeria). Genesis Restaurant is a part of Genesis Group, an indigenous conglomerate that has been around for 30 years with business interests in restaurants, catering, snack food production, hotels, cinemas, real estate, steel trading, and oil and gas.
