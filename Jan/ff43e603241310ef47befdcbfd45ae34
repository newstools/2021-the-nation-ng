Leading Nigerian entertainers including Toyin Abraham and Innocent Tuface Idibia recently took out time to dine with fans on Foodbay TV’s docu-reality series, Dining with Stars. The maiden season of the show featured Innocent ‘TuFace’ Idibia, Yemi Alade, Toyin Abraham, and 2020 Big Brother Naija winner, Laycon. Hundreds of interested fans responded to the call out of which 12 fans were picked with three dedicated to dining with each of the stars. Each set of fans had unique experiences as they dined with their favorite stars to dishes made with the help of Chef Miyonse, a BBNaija alumnus. From spa pampering sessions that all fans enjoyed, to Santa Toyin Abraham’s gifts, to a literal day in the life of 2Baba, to vibing with Yemi Alade on screen and some intellectual banter with Laycon, the fans all attested to a truly wonderful time. Speaking on the show, Femi Ogundoro, the Group Managing Director of Maxima Productions and the man behind Foodbay TV said, “For FoodbayTV, 2020 might have been a funny year, but we’re happy that when this set of fans think of 2020, they’ll remember and reflect on the Dining With The Stars experience as something good and memorable from this year. We are proud to have played a role in making their dreams come true.” He continued: “We look forward to a wonderful New Year, and to a grander second season where we will make more dreams come true.” Adding to Ogundoro’s submissions, Toyin Popoola-Dania, Brand Manager for Devon Kings, said, “The meals they dined on were prepared with our products – seasoning, vegetable oil, and margarine – and this made the experience deliciously special. We are glad to have been a part of feeding their smiles.” The exciting docu-reality series, Dining with Stars, first debuted on FoodbayTV, an African food TV platform, which showcases healthy African food and lifestyle.
