 Nigeria international Henry Onyekuru is on the brink of returning to Galatasaray for a third loan spell, according to reports. Turkish newspaper Milliyet says the Monaco-owned winger has agreed personal terms with the Super Lig side but Galatasaray and the Ligue 1 club have yet to agree financial terms, with a two million euro difference between the parties. Monaco want an obligatory option to purchase set at five million euros included in any deal while the Istanbul club are willing to pay three million euros at the end of the 2020-2021 season. A loan fee of one million euros has been agreed between the two clubs, meaning the total package would be four million euros if Galatasaray have their way. The former Eupen star has had two different loan spells with Galatasaray, scoring 17 goals in 56 appearances and won the Super Lig and Turkish Cup in his first full season with the club. Onyekuru has been frozen out of the Monaco first team picture in the new season, making four appearances in the French Ligue 1, the last of which came against Stade Rennais on September 19. The 23-year-old has a contract with the principality outfit until the end of the 2023-2024 season.
