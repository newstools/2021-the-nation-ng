 NOTWITHSTANDING directives by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) against the backdrop of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, several churches in Kogi State held cross over services into the New Year. Worshippers in most of the churches visited failed to wear face masks, nor observed social distancing. Churches visited in Ajaokuta Local Government Area included The Apostolic Church Nigeria (TAC), United Evangelical Church (UEC), Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) and St. Mary’s Catholic Church. The situation was similar in some of the churches visited in the capital, Lokoja and its environs. One of the clergies in an interaction with our correspondent expressed the optimism that God will protect worshippers from contracting the Coronavirus. The clergy who preferred that his identity not be mentioned explained that prior to the crossover night, the Covid-19 protocols was normally observed, but that could do little in the face of influx of worshipers into the churches for the crossover into the new year. “There is a need for ministers of God, irrespective of their denomination, to join hands together and pray for God to salvage the world from the hands of the wicked ones who brought the pandemic to destroy the world,” he said. Pastor Paul Olukunle of the Apostolic Church Nigeria, FFN Assembly, Ajaokuta, said the Covid-19 pandemic is a test that God can destroy the world within a tinkle of an eye. He admonished Nigerians to believe in God and do according to His will. He expressed hope that 2021 will be full of testimonies and fruitfulness.
