Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on National Assembly Matters Senator Babajide Omoworare has called on Nigerians to beat back the surging wave of COVID-19 with cooperation and adherence to safety protocols than was done with the first wave to curtail its spread and effect. In his new year message issued in Ile-Ife, his home town, Omoworare emphasised the need to keep adhering to COVID-19 protocols, maintain a positive mindset, caution and modesty while pursuing economic prosperity this year. “Defeating COVID-19, its spread and effect is a collective responsibility and must be treated as important by all. Without concerted effort, we will be on a vicious circle. While not allowing COVID-19 to dampen our productive and positive Nigerian spirit, we should equally do our collective best to end the pandemic,” he said. Omoworare urged the citizens to be positive with the 2021 economic outlook, pray for the nation and support the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration to end the pandemic, cushion its effect, solve security, infrastructural and economic challenges. “Permit me to further explore this medium to charge Nigerians, especially the good people of Osun State, to give maximum support to the Governor Gboyega Oyetola-led APC government to sustain the ongoing development drive being experienced in Osun State and Nigeria,” Omoworare said.
