He warned that the government would no longer send relief materials to any community which engages in man-made disaster. He said: “It is erroneous for government to intervene in manmade disasters because it is already it is spending too much in the fight against COVID-19, and no community should add to that burden. “Learn to live in peace with one another, if you do so, development will come to the area and businesses will thrive.” Chairman of Okobo council Sylvester Attah warned the communities that nothing could be gained from war or communal clashes.
