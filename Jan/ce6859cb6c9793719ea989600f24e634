Ahmed Musa further called on the State Government under the leadership of Bako Lalong to make land available for him to build a sports edifice  like the one he recently built in Kano and Kaduna. Also at the event, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Idris Maje , promised to dole out N1million, N700,000, and N500,000,and N300,000 for takeaway for the best goalkeeper, best team and highest goal scorer respectively at the peace football tournament. Meanwhile, West Brom manager Sam Allardyce has confirmed the former Leicester winger is set to link up with the club for a trial. Musa, who had an unremarkable spell with the Foxes between 2016 and 2018, is a free agent after leaving Saudi side Al-Nassr. West Brom will run the rule over him before making a decision on whether to offer him a short-term deal. Allardyce said: “He’s not here yet. He’s a person of interest and when he arrives we’ll alert everybody and let them know.”
