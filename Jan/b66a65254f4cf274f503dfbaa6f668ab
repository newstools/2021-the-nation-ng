The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun has expressed “deep sadness” over the demise of former Minister of State for Commerce and Industries, Senator Jubril Martins-Kuye. APC described his death as “the passing away of one of Ogun’s finest politicians.” In a statement on Sunday by the Publicity Secretary of Ogun APC Caretaker Committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, the late politician was described as an “uncommon bridge builder, patriot and a very humane, courteous and humble politician whose model was politics without bitterness. “Either as a federal minister and Senator of the Federal Republic, Pa Martins Kuye gave a very good account of himself as an accessible community leader, grassroots mobilizer, moulder of people and builder of bridges. He was renowned for his propounded principle of ‘salt solution’ which abhorred sectarian tendencies within political party formation. “While commiserating with the Governor of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun, and the people of Ogun State on the exit of this political titan, one of Ogun’s finest politicians, we pray that will grant the deceased’s immediate and political family, the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” the statement concluded.
