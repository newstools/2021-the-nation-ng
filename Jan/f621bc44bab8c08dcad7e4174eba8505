Traditional rulers in Ido/Osi Local Government of Ekiti State have appealed to the committee superintending the creation of Local Council Development Authorities (LCDAs) to embrace justice and fairness in the location of the LCDAsâ€™ headquarters. The traditional rulers, the Olosi of Osi-Ekiti, Oba Oladiran Adewoye Agunbiade; Olugbole of Igbole-Ekiti, Oba Emmanuel Olugenga Ajayi; and the Onifisin of Ifisin Ekiti, Oba Folarin Fabunmi, backed the creation of new LCDAs from the existing Ido/Osi Council with headquarters in Osi-Ekiti. The monarchs, represented by the Olosi-in-Council, made the call in Ado-Ekiti while addressing the committee on creation of LCDAs. The monarchs, in a paper presented to the committee, hoped that it would study their request and do justice to it. They hailed Governor Kayode Fayemi for putting machinery in motion to consider creating LCDAs, to bring government closer to the people and for administrative convenience. Speaking on behalf of the delegation, the Odofin of Osi-Ekiti, Olaiya Faturoti, said similar agitations were made and presented to successive governments and committees in 1955, 1995, 2003 and 2014. He said Ido and Osi were the two paramount land owners in the local government since time immemorial.
