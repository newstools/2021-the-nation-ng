 FORMER Adamawa State Governor, Senator Jibrilla Bindow has arrived in Yola, the Adamawa State capital. It is his first trip to the state after his exit from power in 2019. At a reception for him yesterday by the the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bindow called for retention of leaders from the state to ward levels instead of conducting fresh elections. Bindow advised the APC members to ensure that they are registered along with their families during the partyâ€™s membership registration, even as he disagreed with the national leadership of the party on fresh elections of officials, except it is meant to replace non-performing ones. Bindow, who interacted with the state caretaker officials of the party on the way forward ahead of 2023, insisted that there was no need to replace the current executive, especially at the ward, local and state levels. The party, he said, should fill vacant positions and replace people who have not done well in their executive positions, especially those known to have engaged in anti-party activities. He apologised for keeping out of the state for so long in spite of calls on him to return home, explaining that his long absence was meant to give the present government breathing space to deliver on its promises.
