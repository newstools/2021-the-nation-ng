Nigeria is set to have its first female ambassador to the United States of America. She is Dr. Uzoma Elizabeth Emenike, Nigeria’s outgoing ambassador to the Republic of Ireland. She also has concurrent accreditation to Iceland. Dr Emenike, who was in the Foreign Service for no less than 30 years before retiring, is the wife of a long-standing ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, Chief Ikechi Emenike. She is one of the about twelve envoys retained by Buhari as a result of their sterling performance during their first outing. The country will be represented in the United Kingdom by Sarafat Ishola, a former minister. Another ex-minister who on the list is Chief Demola Seriki, who will represent the country in Spain. (See list for other postings as obtained by The Nation). The Nation learnt on Monday that the envoys may not be taking their seats abroad yet as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is yet to perfect the process for their resumption. On why the ministry did not release the names and postings of the envoys as approved by the Presidency for so long, the ministry’s spokesman Ferdinand Nwonye told The Nation last week that confirmation of “agreemo” from the prospective host countries is key in posting of envoys. Agreemo is a memorandum from one nation to another agreeing to the appointment of an ambassador or envoy. While it is yet to be confirmed whether the required “agreemo” had been granted, about 11 ambassadors were re-appointed, eight were retained in their current countries of posting and three others were redeployed.
