 SENATE President Ahmad Lawan, on Monday congratulated Professor Maimuna Waziri on her appointment as the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University, Gashua, Yobe State. Lawan, in a statement in Abuja, also congratulated the Governing Council of the University on making the appointment without rancour and under the guidance of due process and best university tradition. He noted that with the appointment of Prof. Waziri, the Governing Council has sustained the steady sail of the university towards becoming a true citadel of learning and research. He said: “Professor Waziri has served with merit in three universities, including the Federal University, Gashua where she was the Deputy Vice-Chancellor until this new appointment. “Her credentials thus amply recommend her for this appointment and underscore the popular expectation that she will discharge the onerous tasks of the office with distinction. “Professor Waziri’s attainments in academics and leadership are inspirational to women in the North and other parts of Nigeria who have dreams of distinguishing themselves in their professions and of making remarkable contributions to national development. “I urge her to continue to be exemplary by bringing her vast administrative and academic experience to bear in working with the management and members of staff to take her university to higher academic rankings.”
