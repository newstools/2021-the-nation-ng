By Rasaq Ibrahim, Ado-Ekiti Following an eviction order to them in Ondo forest reserves by Governor Rotimi Aketedolu, herdsmen have relocated to Ekiti state forests for grazing activities The State Secretary of the Maize Grower Processing Marketer Association of Nigeria, (MAGPAMAN), Tope Emmanuel, raised the alarm during a chat with reporters in Ado-Ekiti on Tuesday. Emmanuel said some herdsmen invaded a multi-million naira farm at the Aduloju farmstead along Ado-Ijan-Ikare roads in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti state capital, destroying crops worth N10 million. He stated that the herders with their cattle destroyed the farm belonging to some members of MAGPAMAN with impunity. Emmanuel stated they had been constantly unleashing terror on the farmers in the area in the last seven days, adding they invaded the farm at night with dangerous weapons. He explained the affected farmers obtained about N6.6 million loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) under anchor borrowers’ programme to plant maize, adding they had incurred losses worth N 10m from the destructive activities of the herders. He called on Governor Kayode Fayemi and other stakeholders to come to their rescue in saving them from the clutches of the deadly herdsmen and helped in recouping their investment. Emmanuel said the police, the Amotekun Corps and other security agencies were aware of the incident but couldn’t intervene for reasons best known to them. When contacted, the Amotekun corps commander, Brig. General Joe Komolafe, who confirmed the development, said: “We are on top of the situation”.
