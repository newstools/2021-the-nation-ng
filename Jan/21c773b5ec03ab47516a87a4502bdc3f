The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) on Friday faulted a statement by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alleging mishandling of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by the Buhari administration. The group described the PDP statement as “endemic myopia and sensational gibberish” designed to deflect public attention from the accusations of embezzlement of funds and incompetent leadership rocking the party’s national secretariat. The BMO, in a statement jointly signed by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, said the numerous successes recorded by the Buhari administration through the proactive initiatives of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as well as commendations by respected global figures were incontrovertible evidence that the PDP allegations were nothing short of misdirected effort. “No responsible government inputs figures in a Budget without being sure of the cost of items. “The Federal Ministry of Finance, which released over N118.37 billion for COVID-19 capital expenditure in 2020, had offered clarification that a supplementary budget would be forwarded to the National Assembly at the appropriate time,” the group said.
