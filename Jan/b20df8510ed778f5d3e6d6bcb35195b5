 Industrious filmmaker, Niyi Akinmolayan promises never to work with individuals or persons who hate the Nigerian film industry known as Nollywood. The passionate filmmaker made this known in a random post on Sunday evening, January 10 through the microblogging site, Twitter. “I can never work with people who hate Nollywood and disrespect the hardworking people in it and then want to come to invest and ask for ROI. If you don’t geddifuk,” he tweeted. The founder of Anthill studios is known to have contributed to the success of top-grossing Nollywood flicks that include ‘The Set Up,’ ‘Chief Daddy,’ ‘The Wedding Party 2,’ ‘The Arbitration,’ ‘Out of Luck,’ and ‘Falling.’ His recent offing, Day of Destiny, is currently airing in cinemas and features Olumide Oworu, Toyin Abraham, Jide Kosoko, Nobert Young, Ini Dima Okojie, Blossom Chukwujekwu, Ireti Doyle, Denola Grey, and Mr. Macaroni.
