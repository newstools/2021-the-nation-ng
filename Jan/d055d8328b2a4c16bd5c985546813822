West Bromwich Albion recorded their first win under Sam Allardyce as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-2 in a see-saw Black Country derby in the Premier League on Saturday, with Matheus Pereira scoring twice from the penalty spot. The result gave West Brom a big boost in their bid to avoid relegation, as they moved to within three points of 17th place, albeit remaining stuck in 19th spot for now. Wolves stay in 14th place. After just seven minutes, Pereira stroked a penalty home to give West Brom an early advantage, Fabio Silva scored a huge goal to equalise for Wolves with just seven minutes to go in the half, and then Willy Boly slammed home from a corner to put Wolves in front in the 43rd minute. In the 52nd minute, Nigeria international Semi Ajayi restored parity when he looped a header in to the back of the net following an O’Shea throw-in – his second Premier League goal this season. “It’s massive. If there was one game to change our season, this is the game. It’s the one fans look forward to the most,” West Brom midfielder Romaine Sawyers said. “We had seven days with the gaffer. This was the first time really on the training ground, getting back to basics… He’s a bit tough on us, but it’s not a happy situation we’re in, so we need that tough love.” The visitors sealed the win when Robinson won another penalty after drawing a foul from defender Conor Coady and Pereira scored from the spot again.
