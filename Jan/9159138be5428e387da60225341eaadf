A kidnapper simply known as Mohammed Amodu, famous for his nefarious activities in Abuja environs, was kidnapped by another kidnapper, Buba Babu, 35, and had to pay N1,555,000 for his freedom. Force Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba, who paraded both kidnappers alongside other criminals in Abuja on Monday, said Babu was notorious for kidnapping citizens on highways around Abuja. Babu, he said, was third in command of a kidnap syndicated headed by one Buji, who was neutralized by the police alongside the second in command. Mba said Babu took leadership of the gang and was notorious for always killing kidnap victims. Babu took Amodu into custody and when the kidnapped kidnapper hesitated to pay, he was shot in the arm. Mba said Mohammed had boasted he had charms and could not be shot and Babu shot him to show how serious he was. The police spokesman said Babu had a strong links between with a major terror group in northern Nigeria. Amodu, Mba said, was known as “Confirm” because he was a reputed marksman in the underworld. “Yet he was kidnapped and held and Mohammed was released after he paid N1.55 million,” Mba said. Amodu, who said he has been involved in more kidnap operations than he can remember, revealed he was kidnapped after supplying 90 rounds of live ammunition to Babu. Amodu said Buba was associated with Boko Haram, and he regained his freedom after paying the ransom. Amodu said there was a time his own gang kidnapped 20 victims at a time. He said he had saved up to N15 million from his nefarious activities. He said he witnessed an operation where Buba kidnapped 55 petsons from a luxurious bus at a time. Also speaking, Buba said he had been into kidnapping for three years. He said as a kingpin he sends boys for major operations along major roads as he never operated within town. He said he broke off from Buji to form his own kidnap gang because of unfairness in sharing ransom money.
