 SEVEN members of the Abia State House of Assembly, who are of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), might defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in April, it has been learnt. Minority Leader Chijioke Chukwu (Bende North), who addressed reporters at his country home, said what began as banter is becoming a reality. He said: “Serious consultations to welcome them are on, as those of us in APC are making plans to break the ranks of PDP in the House. It’s better to stay in the mainstream than hang on in the periphery.” According to Chukwu, most of them have realised the need to belong to the centre to be part of the socio-economic and political meandering. “As for the Speaker, Chinedum Orji, who is my friend; we’re still talking. If he eventually decides to join us, we’ll welcome him. In the next four months, APC will make a major breakthrough in the House. We’re not leaving anything to chance. Many of my colleagues are itching to join,” he added. On Governor Okezie Ikpeazu’s rumoured plan to join the party, Chukwu said the earlier he joins, the better. According to him, some of the people in PDP have a leg in PDP and another in APC. “There’s nothing one can gain staying on the sideline. There are so many things one can get being at the centre, that’s being in the government that controls the central government,” he added. Chukwu, however, warned the party’s leadership to ensure members do not end in self-destruction, noting that internal crisis, particularly in Abia State, could jeopardise its chances in future elections.
