Abductors of Alhaji Suleiman Akinbami, an oil dealer in Ekiti State, have demanded N60 million before setting him free. Akinbami was abducted on Sunday night by four armed assailants at one of his petrol stations along Ado-Ijan-Ikare in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti state capital. A family source said the kidnappers have contacted the them, demanding N60m for his release. The source said, “We pleaded with them to reduce the amount but we are yet to hear from them.” The Ekiti Amotekun Corps commander, Brig.-General Joe Komolafe (retd) said he was not aware of the ransom demand, saying his men were trailing the gunmen.
