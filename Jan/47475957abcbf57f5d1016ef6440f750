Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has declared Ogun state will be his next destination to flush out criminal herdsmen. In the now-viral video, Igboho stated that he has heard about the criminal activities of herdsmen in the state. The Nation had reported how military men escorted herdsmen to flog residents in some villages in Ogun state for rejecting herders in their midst. He said: “What many people do not know about this whole issue is that it was God that wanted to liberate Ibarapa people from the captivity of herdsmen that I went there. “The suffering that the people of Ibarapa were going through was brought to the fore by the death of Dr. Aborode, Aborode’s death exposed a lot of things going on in that area. “Many who have been killed and kidnapped there is not small. We however thank God that normalcy has been restored gradually. “By the grace of God, the remaining issues in Ogun state will be resolved, all criminal herdsmen in Ogun state should get prepared I am coming.” He lamented many politicians were trying to discourage the struggle despite his genuine intentions. “I am more than what anybody can bribe or win over with money. I do not have any children in Nigeria that herdsmen can kidnap and no herdsmen can stop me on the way. “Enough is enough, that is why I’m fighting this struggle. On this struggle, no going back,” Igboho declared. He further warned politicians from sabotaging his struggle against herdsmen in Yorubaland
