A Federal High Court in Lagos on Wednesday admitted in evidence a compact disc (CD) containing expert analysis of the contents of an iPhone allegedly found in the possession hip-hop singer Azeez Fashola, otherwise known as Naira Marley. Justice Nicolas Oweibo admitted the CD tendered in evidence by second prosecution witness Anosike Augustine, on the ground, among others, that the iPhone itself had already been admitted in evidence. Marley is standing trial on money laundering and internet fraud charges preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was arraigned on May 20, 2019, pleaded not guilty and is out on bail. Trial has since commenced with the court adjourning proceedings till yesterday for ruling on whether to admit more evidence against the ‘Am I a Yahoo boy’ and ‘Soapy’ crooner, as prayed by the EFCC. Marley, through his counsel, Olalekan Ojo, SAN, had opposed the anti-graft agency. Giving his ruling yesterday, Justice Oweibo said, “l consider the CD to be admissible in view of the nature of this case. Accordingly it is hereby admitted in evidence and marked Exhibit F.” Justice Oweibo adjourned till March 8 and 11 for continuation of trial. In the charge, the EFCC alleged, among others, that some of the credit cards discovered in Marley’s residence bore the fictitious names Nicole Louise Malyon and Timea Fedorne Tatar. These, it indicated, were used in furtherance of internet scams. The commission said the offences contravened the Money Laundering (Prohibition) and the Cybercrimes Acts.
