Mohammed said the command achieved its highest monthly collection of N13billion despite challenges of COVID-19 and #EndSARs protests that affected businesses globally. He commended terminal operators at the port for their support towards increased revenue and efficiency. For instance, Mohammed described the cargo handling crane owned by West African Container Terminal (WACT) as the best in Nigeria, which he said has helped for greater efficiency at the facility. He added that plans to install scanner in Onne would increase the command’s productivity, efficiency and capacity to detect concealments faster “In the face of several challenges that impacted on shipping and port activities last year, our operatives were resilient, being at work always, even during the COVID-19 Pandemic outbreak and the nationwide lockdown that followed. “Last year, this Command collected a total of ?118,959,214,999.53k.

We have also made remarkable increase from our ?94,044,676,428.17 that was collected in 2018. “It is worthy of note that under my watch, the Command achieved N13 billion monthly collection for the first time in its 37-year history.
