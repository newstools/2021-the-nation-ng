Gabriel Jesus’s early strike was enough to beat Sheffield United and send Manchester City four points clear at the top of the Premier League. It was fine work from Ferran Torres to work his way through two Sheffield United players inside the area before cutting back for striker Jesus to tap home after just nine minutes. City have 44 points from 20 games with Manchester United, who are at Arsenal later on Saturday, on 40 points from the same number of matches. Sheffield United had arrived at the Etihad Stadium on the back off their shock 2-1 win at Old Trafford against Manchester United and delivered another solid and organised display. City had over 75 per cent possession but struggled to create many real openings after the goal, although Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale did well in the 72nd minute to keep out a fine drive from Oleksandr Zinchenko and Aymeric Laporte’s effort a minute later. The Yorkshire side, still rooted to the foot of the table on eight points, went close to an equaliser with a late John Fleck drive that flashed past the post. Ramsdale did well again to keep out a Jesus effort in stoppage time as City had to settle for a single goal victory – Guardiola’s 500th win as a manager.
