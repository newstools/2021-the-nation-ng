 A non-profit organisation, Triple J Foundation, has put smiles on the faces of some underprivileged members of the society through its empowerment project, tagged: “Angel at Christmas” which was held recently in the Panama Community area of Ikoyi, Lagos. According to a statement by the foundation’s Coordinator, Dr. Douglas Jombo, the debut project was put together to provide food, clothing, books and toys for underprivileged children in the community, especially in Lagos State. He said, “TripleJ Foundation is the initiative of three Kidpreneur Sisters, Jessica, Juanita and Jemima Douglas-Jombo. It was birthed to ease the pains of poor feeding among underprivileged children and the elderly in our society. We jump-started the initiative during the COVID-19 lockdown with the SDG2 – Zero Hunger for children as its major focus.” On the organization’s objective, the coordinator discloses that the event was meant to extend love, provide food and gifts to about 50 less privileged children in Lagos. He says the initiative was to teamup with like-minds to eradicate hunger during this yuletide season and carry out the SDG2 -Zero Hunger for children goal of the United Nations.  “Beyond today’s event, we are hoping in our future plans to do more by providing back to school kits as well as funding of school fees to children who cannot afford it.” He noted.  The beneficiaries also recieved drinks and packed Jollof Rice which was specially prepared  by fast-rising social media influencer and Teen Chef, Jessica Douglas-Jombo , who also runs a popular food content site on Youtube: “Cooking with Jessie.”  The foundation says it’s opened to having well meaning individuals, private organizations sponsor the event in 2021 whilst also calling on the Government at all levels to do all within her powers to improve on welfare of citizens and to provide enabling environment for businesss to thrive.
