 NAPOLI coach Gennaro Gattuso has received good news on their number 9, Victor Osimhen with the striker receiving the green light to return to training. His latest coronavirus test came back negative, meaning he will no longer be self-isolating at his home in Posillipo. Napoli confirmed via Twitter on Friday evening that Osimhen has overcome the virus. The Nigeria international was diagnosed with the coronavirus disease exactly three weeks ago upon his return to Italy from Lagos, where he celebrated his 22nd birthday without observing COVID-19 protocols. Osimhen was inactive for Napoli before contracting the virus, having suffered a shoulder injury during the second half of Nigeriaâ€™s 4-4 draw against Sierra Leone on November 13.
