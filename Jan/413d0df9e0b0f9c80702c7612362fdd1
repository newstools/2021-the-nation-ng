Lagos State Government has threatened to impound any truck that flouts traffic law. The government on Wednesday read a riot act against truck and trailer operators, indicating that it would not hesitate to impound for months, any vehicle found contravening the Lagos State Traffic Reform Law 2018. It restricted truck movements to dedicated routes and night time, saying any truck found moving on other routes outside the laid down ones, or moving in the day, would be sanctioned. The government said when the directive becomes operational, trucks will only be permitted to move between 9pm and 6am. Transportation Commissioner Frederic Oladeinde, who spoke in Alausa, Ikeja at a stakeholders’ meeting on the implementation of trucks and long vehicles restriction to night time and dedicated routes, said the restriction was in compliance with Section 45 of the Transport Reform Law. He added that it was aimed at sanitising Apapa, ridding the state of traffic congestion and ensuring that other road users have access and make use of the roads. Oladeinde said the development was part of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s efforts to curb accidents attributed to the activities/operations of trucks/trailers on roads. He added: “This is in line with Mr. Governors’ THEMES Agenda, especially as it relates to Traffic Management and Transportation and the ease of doing business. “Some of the things we will be enforcing are restrictions of containerised trailers and trucks on our roads from 9pm to 6am.”
