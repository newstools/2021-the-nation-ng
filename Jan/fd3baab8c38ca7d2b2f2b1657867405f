There was heavy protest in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Thursday as commercial drivers, members of the Nigeria Forest Services known as Forest guards, farmers and traders stormed the streets protesting in support of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu order to herdsmen to vacate forest reserves in the state within seven days. The protesters carried placards urging the Ondo Governor not to back down on his directive. Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Comrade Jacob Adejo, said commercial drivers were no longer safe in the state. Adejo said his members need protection as herders attacked them with impunity as well as kidnapped them before now.
