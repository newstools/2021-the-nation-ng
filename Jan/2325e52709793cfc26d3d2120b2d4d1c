Lagos State Information and Strategy Commissioner Gbenga Omotoso has urged Lagosians to respect the COVID-19 protocols, to stem the tide of infection. He said the second wave of the pandemic is worrisome, advising people to keep safe. Omotoso, who said COVID-19 is no respected of persons, added that prevention is better than cure. At the weekend, Television Continental (TVC) crew that interviewed patients at the Yaba Isolated Centre said it is advisable to obey the protocols to avoid the consequence of disobedience. A correspondent, Adedoja Salam-Adeniyi, said: “I experienced heart wrenching scenes at the Yaba IDH. People – men, women, young and old were struggling to breath. COVID-19 second wave is nastier. Please, stay safe.” The state government has warned that the virus is spreading like a wild fire. Also, doctors have warned that the new variant comes with more respiratory distress and more patients depend on oxygen. Lagos State Government is planning to reopen old isolation centres as more cases are reported. Many patients are from Alimoso, Epe, Alapere, Iponri and Surulere, according to the report. Also, 80 per cent of patients are critically ill and require oxygen, according to the report. The commissioner reminded the people that curfew between 12am and 4 am was still in force, saying clubbing during the period would be treated as violation. He said arrested clubbers would be prosecuted. Omotoso said: “The second wave is deadlier and spreads faster. People should observe physical distancing, wear face masks and wash their hands or use hand sanitiser always. “Residents are advised to avoid large gathering and ensure strict adherence to the COVID-19 guidelines. The second wave of the pandemic has continued to spread faster among Lagosians with increased cases of patients being admitted at isolation centres.”
