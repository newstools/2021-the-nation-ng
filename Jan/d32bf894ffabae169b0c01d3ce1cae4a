Brighton boosted their Premier League survival hopes as Neal Maupay’s winner against a lacklustre Leeds United ended a run of nine games without a win. Maupay tapped in after 17 minutes following slick build-up from Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Trossard. Brighton hit the bar through Trossard’s deflected cross shortly after, while the Argentine fired over another good chance in the second half. Leeds created little throughout and managed just two efforts on target. Brighton’s victory means they move five points clear of third-bottom Fulham, who plays against Chelsea later on Saturday. Leeds remain 12th in their first season back in the top flight, having to take 23 points from their opening 18 games.
