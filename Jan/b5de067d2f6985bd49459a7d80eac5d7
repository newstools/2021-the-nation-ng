Leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has issued a 14-day ultimatum to South East Governors to ban all forms of open grazing in the region in compliance with the 1969 statutory law of Nigeria. Kanu, who issued the notice through IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, warned the group’s security outfit would commence enforcement of the anti-grazing Law across the entire region if no action was taken at the expiration of the ultimatum. He commended the steps taken by the Governors in the South West in banning open grazing, insisting that such move must be reciprocated and consolidated in the eastern region. The statement reads: “We wish to humbly and most submissively call upon all the governors of the East, to as a matter of urgency, ban all manner of open grazing in the region in compliance with the 1969 statutory law of #Nigeria that banned such provocative and primitive practice by Fulani herdsmen. “The bold step taken by Yoruba governors in banning open grazing in their region is commendable and as such MUST be reciprocated and consolidated by a similar pronouncement in the East. “If after 14 days there is no firm and decisive action by Eastern governors to ban open grazing in our land, #ESN will step into the breach to commence the enforcement of this 1969 Anti-Grazing Law across the entire region. Don’t say you were not informed or given prior warning.”
