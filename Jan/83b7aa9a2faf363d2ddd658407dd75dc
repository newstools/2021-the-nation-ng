Tyson Fury’s eagerly-anticipated heavyweight title unification fight with Anthony Joshua is unlikely to be held in the UK. Negotiations over the long-awaited Battle of Britain resumed after Joshua’s ninth-round KO victory over Kubrat Pulev in December. Talks over a two-fight deal have progressed well and both parties are confident an agreement will soon be finalised. But Fury’s co-promoter Frank Warren isn’t confident of the biggest fight in the history of British boxing taking place in the UK. The Queensbury Promotions chief told ESPN: “There are a few venues but nothing concrete at the moment. “I very much doubt it will be in the UK because of COVID, and it will be a two-fight contract.” Warren’s doubts over the fight happening in the UK are also shared by Fury’s other co-promoter, Bob Arum. The 89-year-old told talkSPORT: “The appropriate place would’ve been the United Kingdom. “But with the restrictions and uncertainty, we’re looking for a site someplace else – be it the Middle East or Asia. “And I’m sure that once we get this document signed, we’ll jointly be able to select the site and get it announced.” Legal action from former WBC heavyweight king Deontay Wilder – who Fury dethroned last February – could potentially derail the blockbuster fight. The American, 32, is adamant he’s still contractually entitled to a trilogy fight with the Brit. Fury and his representatives, however, are adamant The Bronze Bomber’s rematch clause expired last October. Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, recently revealed he’s sent a draft contract to Team Fury telling The Daily Mail: “The contract reflects the positive nature of the discussions we have had so far around this fight. “We now await their comments before we all move on to agreeing a location. “We hope to have something signed within the next two weeks.”
