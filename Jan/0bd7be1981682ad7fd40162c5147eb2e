Fulani settlement at Naâ€™ikko village in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State has been attacked by bandits, leaving no fewer than 12 persons killed, with many houses razed. The bandits were said to have stormed the village Thursday night and started shooting sporadically. It was gathered that most residents of the community whose houses were razed fled their homes and took refuge at Barkallahu village in the Igabi Local Government Area of the state. Nura Haruna, who lost two of his sons and two brothers in the attack, called on the Kaduna State Government to come to their rescue. Narrating how the incident happened to reporters when the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, visited the displaced persons at where they are taking refuge in Barrkalahu, Naruna described the incident as an unwarranted attack on the innocent locals. He, however, called on the security agencies and the Kaduna State Government to fish out the perpetrators of the attack and bring them to justice. On his part, the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home affairs while commiserating with the victims over the killings, however, appealed to them to recourse to the law, and to shun any form of reprisals. He assured them that the government will do everything within its powers to arrest the masterminds of the attack.
