A strong Southampton side knocked holders Arsenal out of the FA Cup in the fourth round courtesy of a first-half own goal on Saturday. The Saints were rewarded for their attacking intent in the opening period when Gabriel turned in Kyle Walker-Peters’ cross in the 24th minute. It was the first goal Arsenal had conceded in 508 minutes as they suffered a first loss in seven matches. Southampton will face another Premier League side, Wolves, in the next round. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said; ‘We’re really sad to be out of the competition and disappointed about the way we lost the game, conceding from an area in which we cannot give the ball away.  ‘We had some issues controlling the game in the first-half and some unforced errors. We didn’t hit the target. Two or three big chances in the second half but not enough to win the game. ‘The way we conceded the goal is completely our own fault. We have to compete in this game or you know you’re out. We have to do that better, it is a lesson. ‘They all tried so hard, it was a really intense game. Southampton play really aggressive. I hope we can use that to be more prepared for Tuesday. ‘We are looking in the market to see what else we can do. We moved some players, we are short in one or two positions.’
