 THE police in Lagos have arrested 43 clubbers, including strippers, at a night club on Victoria Island. They were arrested on Sunday for allegedly violating COVID-19 protocols/guidelines. Spokesman of the State Police Command, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said in a statement on Monday: “The Police operatives attached to Maroko Division, on the order of the Commissioner of Police, went after the deviant clubbers and got them arrested in the club clustering and clubbing without any regard for the COVID-19 protocols. “The CP, Hakeem Odumosu, has ordered that the suspects be moved to taskforce office in Oshodi for prosecution. “He ordered that club owners should no longer be spared as they encourage total disregard for the protocols.” The CP urged Lagosians to be law-abiding and to value their lives in view of the rising COVID-19 cases globally.
