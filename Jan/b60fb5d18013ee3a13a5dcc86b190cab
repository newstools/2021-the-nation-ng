 Two security guards at a public cemetery in Ondo town have been rescued from being lynched by men of the Amotekun Corps in Ondo State. The two men were accused of exhuming corpses from the cemetery they were employed to guard. An eyewitness said an alarm was raised that the two men were in possession of human heads severed from buried corpses. The source said: “Very early today (Sunday) somebody went to defecate in a bush beside the cemetery and he saw Alhaji with a sledge hammer and he broke one of the tombs in the cemetery. “After some minutes he came out with a bag . So the person that saw him raised the alarm and we rushed to the scene. When we checked the bag Alhaji carried, we saw a human head in the bag. “When we went round the cemetery, we discovered that about 44 tombs have no dead bodies inside them. They have been exhumed by ritualists. So we have handed them over to the Amotekun corps.” But the State Commander of Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, who confirmed the arrest, said they were rescued when the residents were about to lynch them. He said no human heads were not found on the suspects. “The suspects were rescued by our men when the residents were about to kill them. We have handed them over to the police.” But the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Tee- Leo Ikoro, said the suspects have not been handed over to the police.
