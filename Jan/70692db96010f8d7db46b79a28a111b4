 Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has invited individuals, groups and relevant stakeholders to collaborate with the state government in ending the menace of banditry attacks in the state. According to a press statement by the governor’s Special Assistant on New Media, Malam Bishir Ya’u, he made the disclosure, when he received a delegation of Katsina State Security Committee Initiative led by the former Speaker of the defunct Kaduna State House of Assembly, Alhaji Mamman Abubakar Danmusa,  at the Government House, Katsina. Masari also used the occasion to acknowledge the contributions of some well-meaning indigenes of the state that returned home and assisted the government towards overcoming current security problems. He said, ’’your decision to return home to contribute your quota is timely and will go a long way in solving the avalanche of security challenges in the state. ‘’As a result of banditry in the state, many people lost their lives, while several others were displaced resulting in losing their sources and  livelihood. Banditry attacks have inflicted damage on the social and economic activities of the state that will take years to repair.’’ He lamented that thousands of farmers in the frontline local governments have been denied access to their farms due to incessant attacks by the bandits during the farming seasons, an ugly development that has created large deficits in both food and cash crop productions. Earlier, the chairman of the group, Alhaji Mamman Abubakar  Danmusa said they had resolved to organize themselves in order to assist the government to get the state out of the woods. He further maintained that they were at Government House to show solidarity in recognition of the state government’s steadfastness towards securing the lives and property of the citizenry.
