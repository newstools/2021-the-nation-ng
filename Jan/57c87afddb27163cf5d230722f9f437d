The Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas, has urged personnel of the NNS Jubilee to ensure adequate maintenance of infrastructure provided for their use in the base. Ibas said this during the inauguration of 1Ã—36 rooms ratings arrival hall constructed by the Naval Headquarters for NNS Jubilee in Ikot Abasi on Wednesday. The CNS, who was represented by the Commander Eastern Fleet, Rear Adm. Perry Onwuzulike, said that the project was part of the chief of naval staff infrastructure development going on across the country. He said that the strategic vision was to develop infratructure in all the naval base as a deliberate attempt to ease accommodation problem for personnel. Ibas urged those who would take possession of the facilities to see them as their own, maintain and protect the facilities for future generation.
