 FEMI Ogundoro’s Foodbay TV has announced the second season of its reality show, Streetz Food Naija. The announcement for the second season of the documentary reality TV show in partnership with Devon Kings was announced in a private event recently. The producers informed viewers and the media that the expected 13 candidates would be shortlisted from the entries across the country. For the second season, organisers say the experience will be bigger with a whopping sum of N5 million grand prize for the winner and get a scholarship to attend a culinary school while the first runner and the second runner will win huge sums and SME toolkits to enable them to excel better after the show. As it did in its first season, Streetz Food Naija 2 will be focusing on the street food vendors across Nigeria who will be showcased, celebrated, and also rewarded for coming out tops. The 13 contestants chosen across Nigeria will be rated by four carefully selected judges. While Chef Ette, Chef Nutella, and Adesola Ladejobi return for the second season, Tosan Jemide of Cakes by Tosan will be making his debut on the reality show. An excited Ogundoro said: “FoodBay TV covers everything you can think of when it comes to food. Food is life and Streetz Food Naija is one of its products. Like we did in the first season, we are looking for the best in terms of street food in the world. We are looking for engagement, creativity and the major goal is to elevate people. We are taking the second season beyond the culinary space and to the street. Street food is big all around the world but in Nigeria, people don’t respect street food, so what we have set out to do is empower them to package their food to be enticing and globally accepted. In the end, everyone will come together for a food festival. However, because of the pandemic, we won’t be having the festival and during the show, we would be following the guidelines and rules of the NCDC to avoid and curb the spread of the coronavirus.”
