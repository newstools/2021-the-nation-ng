Fuel Prices were collected from all the 774 local governments across the country from over 10,000 respondents and their locations. The prices obtained reflected actual prices households bought fuel, together with the prices reportedly sold by the fuel suppliers. The average of all the prices was then reported for each state, and the average for the country was collated from the averages for the states. (NAN)
