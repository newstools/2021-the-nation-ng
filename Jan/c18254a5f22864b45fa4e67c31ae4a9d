Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has gone into self-isolation after one of his aides tested positive for COVID-19 pandemic. Deputy Governor Benson Abounu made this known on Sunday at the Armed Forces Remembrance Interdenominational Service organised by the Benue State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). It was held at ECWA Church, Markudi. The deputy governor said the governor would have loved to be present at the church service, but he had gone into self-isolation following a medical reportÂ  that a permanent secretary and his family tested positive for the pandemic. Abounu, the chairman, State Action Committee on COVID-19, said the governor had not shown any symptom of the virus after being in isolation for nine days. He said Governor Ortom will continue to remain in isolation for the approved number of days until a test shows he is negative. The deputy governor, while lamenting the rate at which the virus has continued to kill personalities in the state, noted that in the last five days, the state had lost four prominent persons, including a serving local government chairman. Confirming that the virus is real, Abounu urged residents and other Nigerians to adhere to the COVID-19 protocols, to reduce infection rate.
