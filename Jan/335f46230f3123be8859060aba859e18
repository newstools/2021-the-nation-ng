Residents of an estate in Lekki, Lagos, have alleged that some trespassers are planning to take over their properties. They claimed that the trespassers were using the police for the illegal act at Alma Beach Estate, Lekki.  Some armed policemen, they alleged, had been deployed for the trespassers’ use in violation of the directives of the attorney-general of the federation (AGF). The crisis started in 2017 when a company laid claim to 150 plots of land in the estate, without providing any proof. The Lagos State Government repudiated the firm’s claim in a July 3, 2020 letter to the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) Zone 2. In the letter, the surveyor-general confirmed the residents’ titles to the land, with a survey plan number LA/0807/2007/05, adding that NICON Trustees survey plan number SJA/301/076K/2003/LA ‘’does not exist in the state’s records’’. Earlier the residents had got an injunction from the Federal High Court, restraining NICON Trustees from the land. Based on the court order, the AGF wrote to the inspector-general of police (IGP) on the need for peace in the estate. Reacting, the residents’ lawyer, Dr Muiz Banire (SAN), said it was shocking that things were still tense despite the court order. “If the rightful allottees decide to defend themselves against the invasion and destruction of their homes and properties, and there is a breakdown of law and order in Alma Beach Estate, any police officer responsible for the deployment of policemen to provide cover for the hoodlums terrorising the estate should be held responsible,” he said.
