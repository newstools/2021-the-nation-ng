Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni’s main challenger in Thursday’s election, Bobi Wine, alleged yesterday that the military besieged his home, as votes were still being counted. “We are under siege. The military has jumped over the fence and has now taken control of our home,” Bobi Wine, tweeted. Museveni, who is seeking a sixth term, shot into an early lead yesterday according to tallies released by the electoral commission. The incumbent was credited with 63 per cent of the votes and Wine with 28 per cent in 29 per cent of polling stations Wine dismissed the commission’s count as a joke. He declared himself President-elect, telling reporters in Kampala: “We secured a comfortable victory.” He added: “The people of Uganda voted massively for change of leadership from a dictatorship to a democratic government. But Mr. Museveni is trying to paint a picture that he is in the lead. What a joke!” Government spokesman, Ofwono Opondo, denied Wine’s claims. He said: “This is what we expected before. Even before we went into polling, he said the election will be rigged.” The election has been dogged by controversy from the beginning. No fewer than 45 people were killed in an unrest that broke out across the after Wine was arrested on the campaign trail in November. On Monday, Facebook shut the accounts of Ugandan government officials, saying that the pages were being used to manipulate public debate ahead of elections while on Tuesday the government ordered all social media to be blocked across the country, although many people retained access through VPN services.
