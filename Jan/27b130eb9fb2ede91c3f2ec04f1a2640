All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain Senator Tokunbo Abiru (Lagos East) has said that he was not involved in the cancellation of the selection of a new vice chancellor for the Lagos State University (LASU) by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. In a 10-minute video published by a blogger, it was alleged that Abiru prevailed on the governor to cancel the first selection process. He also alleged that the Senator told Sanwo-Olu to screen out indigenes of the Ikorodu Division contesting for the vice-chancellor. He also claimed that Abiru gave the advice on the ground that Ikorodu Division was only interested in the governor, and not the VC position. Abiru said in a statement that “all these claims were nothing but mere figments of Mr. Oshodi’s imagination,” adding that they do not in any way represent the truth. He maintained that he neither prevailed on the governor to cancel the process first initiated by the Joint Council and Senate Selection Committee to select LASU’s next VC nor influenced him to zone the position out of the Ikorodu Division for any reason. He said as a matter of fact, he did not play any role in the whole process. Abiru stressed: “For the purpose of record, I worked in public and private sectors for 32 years before I partisan politics. For this period, I was a promoter of good corporate governance hinged on competence, due process and transparency. “Even though I am now in partisan politics, I still believe these values should be at the core of operations in all public or private institutions. “Coming from this background, I strongly believe the appointment of LASU VC, like other tertiary institutions nationwide, should be based on competence and due process. “This is the position I have always held, especially in this era when we consciously look forward to our universities to lead the path to sustainable development in all facets of life.”
