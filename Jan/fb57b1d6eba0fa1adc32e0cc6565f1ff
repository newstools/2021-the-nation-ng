 THE Plateau State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the brutal manner local government workers were dispersed by security men during a peaceful protest. They protest non-implementation of the N30, 000 minimum wage. The Nation reports that the local government workers were dispersed by security men last week on the orders of the state government on the premise that they were preventing state civil servants from accessing their offices, and also that the state government was not responsible for their predicaments. The state chapter of the PDP, in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Mr. John Akans said “governance requires a positive response to decision making in solving conflicts in a proper and functional institution by meeting the needs of the masses in a democratic manner that impact on people’s lives and not through brutal approach against the people meant to be protected. “We believe that governance requires a positive response to decision making in solving conflicts in a proper and functional institution by meeting the needs of the masses in a democratic manner that impact on people’s lives and not brutal approach against the people you are to protect.” According to him, what happened to local government workers who protested was an outrageous attack on the fundamental rights of not only the protesting workers but all Nigerians, particularly when on a peaceful protest. “This gross abuse of power shown by Governor Lalong clearly shows that he is truly a loser already and he needs to understand that even as a governor, there is a limit to intimidation. His action is highly irresponsible for harassing and intimidating civil servants who are demanding justice against low wages and unjust leadership. It is evidently clear that Governor Lalong has completely run out of leadership ideas.”
