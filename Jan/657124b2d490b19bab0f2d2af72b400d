 THE All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State has vowed to take over the state’s leadership from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the November governorship election. Caretaker Chairman Basil Ejidike, at the weekend in Awka, said the APC was tired of playing second fiddle. He spoke at a meeting of party stakeholders with governorship aspirants. George Moghalu was absent at the meeting. Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige expressed worries over ‘deficiencies in the party’s reward system’. He, however, assured party members of improvement, pleading that they exercise more patience as President Muhammadu Buhari had other goodies for them Ngige said: “Since I joined politics, current members of the State Working Committee (SWC) are one of the best, in terms of educational qualification, but their output is not commensurate with your experience. As leaders, you must see yourselves as workers and should not be partisan. “You’ve not done enough to cement the party, hence the fracture lines. It’s not their fault to an extent. Our reward system is not commensurate to other parties, especially when the PDP is ruling…” Senator Andy Uba described the ongoing   registration as very important to APC, adding that another key factor was complete reconciliation to enable the party win. “Nobody should see himself or herself as unequal. We can’t afford to allow governance fall into the hands of our enemies again,” Uba said. Tony Nwoye, who lamented the party’s abysmal performance in past elections, said: “We must tell ourselves the truth; we didn’t perform well in 2019, we couldn’t win any seat in the house. I don’t want to talk about 2017. “Let’s leave acrimony and pursue unity and oneness. We need people and there’s need to review our process.” He urged leaders to sit up, and Ngige to take the party’s message to President Buhari to make the house fertile.
