A member of a local vigilante group in Rivers State, popularly known as OSPAC, has allegedly shot and killed a woman, identified as Mrs. Beatrice Obisike, at a burial ceremony in a community in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state. The incident reportedly happened in Rumukeni village on Saturday. The incident happened less than 24 hours after another OSPAC member inflicted deep machete cuts on a 19-year-old man, Jeremiah Gabriel, for allegedly dropping a dead snake in a compound in Emuihua council area of the state. The incident happened in Rumuekpe community. His attacker is said to have been arrested. A source close to the burial venue, who narrated the incident to newsmen in Port Harcourt yesterday, said the mother of four was hit by a stray bullet when OSPAC members were shooting sporadically, apparently to announce their presence at the ceremony. The source said the victim was one of the cooks at the burial and was busy in the kitchen section when she suddenly slumped after being hit by the bullet. She died instantly. The husband of the victim Justice Obisike has called for justice. Obisike queried why OSPAC members are still armed despite the Inspector General of Police Muhammad Idris Adamuâ€™s directive last year that all civilians including local vigilante should hand over their guns or face prosecution.
