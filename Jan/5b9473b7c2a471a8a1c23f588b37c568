Nigerian disc jockey, Catherine Obianuju Udeh aka DJ Switch believed to be in an asylum in a foreign country, has begged Singer Peter Okoye to send her a gift as he plans to make giveaways. DJ Switch allegedly flew out of Nigeria following allegations of death threats following the #EndSARS protest. The activist and disc jockey stated she is no more working due to her situation and in exile, which explains why she may be unable to afford certain things.
