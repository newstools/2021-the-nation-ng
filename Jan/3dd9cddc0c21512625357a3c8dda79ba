Oyo chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended its chairman in Ibadan North East Local government, Mr. Taiwo Iyiola for alleged anti- party activities. The party, in a communiqué by the State Working Committee, noted Iyiola was suspended for multiple allegations of anti-party activities by the executives of his local political ward and sequel to his suspension from the party at his ward level. Oyo PDP however directed the vice chairman, Mr. Isiaka Fatokun to immediately take over the leadership pending conclusion of investigations. But Iyiola described his suspension as illegal, saying he got to know the news of his suspension on a Facebook page. Iyiola noted he was surprised when he saw the news, adding that he has never been found wanted and the party do not have any evidence for anti- party activities levelled against him. Iyiola said: “I’ve never for once engaged in any anti part activities since I’ve been in this party, and I’ve never been served any query, so, i don’t know what my offence was that warranted my suspension. “This is the local government of Governor Seyi Makinde and the governor himself knows that am doing my duty as expected. I am sure that the Governor is not aware of the purported suspension. “This issue can destroy the party because why will the party suspend an innocent person? It shows that anybody can be tormented and frustrated out of the party.”
