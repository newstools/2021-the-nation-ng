Former National Secretary of Labour Party (LP) Dr. Kayode Ajulo has lamented the demise of its national chairman, Alhaji Abdulkadir Salam, Baraden Paiko, He said in a statement in Abuja that the party leader was an embodiment of hardwork and courage. Ajulo said: “As a former National Secretary of the Labour Party, elected on the same day with Alh. Salam as National Chairman. I share in the deep sense of loss that this news evokes. “The pain we all feel is deep and raw; I can only hope that time will ease the pain that the loss of yet another stalwart and citizen of our dear country as this year draws to a close. “Comrade A A Salam was a leader who stood by his dogma dearly and worked assiduously for entrenchment of what assures peace and prosperity. “He was a brother-in-arms and even though we had ideological differences while I was the National Secretary of the Labour Party, I will remember Comrade Abdulsalam as a courageous person who always stood up for his own convictions.”
