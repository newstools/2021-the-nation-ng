Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo has written a parting message to Manchester United fans after his one-year loan deal with the club came to an end. The striker has only made four appearances this term and he is gutted that his journey will not be continuing at Old Trafford. “It’s so hard to see this dream come to an end,” Ighalo wrote. “But I give God the glory for helping me fulfill this lifelong dream of putting on a Manchester United shirt as a player and represent this great club, it was indeed an honor I will forever cherish and be grateful for. “To the manager I say thank you for trusting and believing in me when many did not, to my amazing team mates I will miss you guys , it was always fun and a time I look forward to training and spending time with all of you . And I pray we win the LEAGUE and FA cup this year. “To the best fans in the world (the Manchester United fans) we have missed you, but we hear your voices cheering us on from afar, we can’t wait to have you all back on the stands.  “I’m still and would remain a MANCHESTER UNITED FAN forever. Once a Red, always a Red. “Thank you @manchesterunited and God bless.” Ighalo was brought in on loan from Chinese side Shanghai Greenland Shenhua last January and he helped fire the club into the Champions League places. However, Edinson Cavani’s arrival from Paris Saint-Germain last summer pushed Ighalo down the pecking order and he has found minutes hard to come by. The 31-year-old is under contract with Shanghai until the end of 2021 but he could return to the Premier League on loan to one of United’s rivals.
