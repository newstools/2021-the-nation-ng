 HENRY Onyekuru has admitted  signing for Everton was something of a risk but insists  he has no regrets about the move as he looks for a move away from his current club AS Monaco in France. He has managed just four appearances for Monaco this season, with the last coming as a late substitute in the 2-1 away defeat to Rennes in September. The 23-year-old joined the English Premier League side in 2017 but failed to make a competitive appearance for the club. He arrived at Everton from Belgian club KAS Eupen on the back of a 22-goal season, but was immediately sent on loan to Anderlecht. That was followed by another loan this time to Turkish side Galatasaray before sealing a permanent move to French club AS Monaco in 2019. “The first dream is to play in the Premier League, it may not have worked out at Everton but I have no regrets about it,” Onyekuru told BBC Africa Sport. “When I received offers from top clubs in England I knew back then that I needed a work permit to play. “That it didn’t happen then has nothing to do with my talent but red tape that’s beyond my control.” Onyekuru also admitted he would have to leave the former French champions in order to get more playing time and is looking for a move this month. He added:  “I am not someone to make excuses about life or football, but I think the manager has a different plan and I am probably not in that plan. “I’ll definitely be leaving in January for football reasons, so I can return to the form I need to be in.”
