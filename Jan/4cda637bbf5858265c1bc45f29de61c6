 EX-HOUSEMATE of the BBNaija reality show, Dianne Russet, has put a nosy follower on Instagram in her place when she compared her to a cancer patient. The reality TV show star had shared a new picture of herself on her Instagram page when the follower referred to her new look as being similar to that of a cancer patient. “You look like a cancer patient with that haircut,” the follower with the handle @veekeybella commented. Dianne was however quick to knock the fan and schooled her for her insensitive comment. She replied, “And you think it’s funny? I mean it’s ok not to comment but to be insensitive about certain things then you are very stupid or lack sense. “Y’all steadily troll people and be the first person to react when something happens. God forbid, I’m not a cancer patient but be careful what you type, you don’t even know half of what people go through you just come here to type whatever. Y’all need to learn Nigeria is not the problem you are.” Dianne participated in the 2019 edition of the BBNaija reality show tagged ‘Pepper Dem’. Though she didn’t make it to the finale, her best friend on the show, Mercy Eke, eventually won the show. Dianne has, since leaving the show, gone ahead to start a career for herself in the world of film. She already has two short films to her credit and acted in both films.
