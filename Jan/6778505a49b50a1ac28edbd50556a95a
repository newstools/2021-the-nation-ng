Softworks Limited, a software development company on Friday announced the re-launch of Softworks.xyz, a platform designed exclusively to solve the unemployment amongst young Nigerians by connecting freelancers with tech and design service seekers to collaborate and get work done. Through Softwork, businesses and individuals can hire freelancers with graphic designing skills, websites and mobile app development, and digital marketing. The tech innovation is the first of its kind in the nation’s media and technology space created specifically to benefit skilled and qualified Nigerians seeking employment. CEO of Novarick Homes and Co-founder at Softworks, Noah Ibrahim, explained the initiative is to move away from the large, untargeted job market to tailored services that address the specific needs of the employer by bringing freelancers together in one place. He also stated by relaunching this software, steps are taken in the right direction to solve the unemployment problem. According to him: “Unemployment is prevalent in our society today. Owing to the pandemic, the statistics of unemployment surged to the highest we have seen in recent times. “For this reason, we sought out an innovative way to solve this problem. The demand for some certain skills is currently on the rise, our mission is to create a hub where employers can access the skills that they need in their organization by connecting them with freelancers.” Through this platform, employers will be able to engage directly with freelancers by simply assessing their competence in certain skills using performance ratings, completed jobs and peer testimonials. This will allow businesses to access people with specific knowledge and understanding unique to certain job functions that would normally be difficult to find during recruitment processes like blockchain Programmers or software developers in highly specific coding languages.
