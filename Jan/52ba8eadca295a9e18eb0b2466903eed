The police in Ughelli ‘A’ Division at the weekend killed two robbery suspects in a gun battle that lasted for about an hour. The incident occurred after a failed attempt to rob a customer, who had gone to the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to withdraw money. One of the suspects, who reportedly escaped with bullet injuries, was among the three-man gang, who attempted to rob customers that were leaving the ATM about 3pm. Command spokesman DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, who confirmed the incident, told The Nation that the police at Ughelli ‘A’ Division received a distress call that three robbers were operating close to a new generation bank on Market road, Ughelli.
