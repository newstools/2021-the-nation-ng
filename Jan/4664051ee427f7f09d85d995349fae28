According to Lawrence, the Controller-General of the service, Mr Ja’afaru Ahmed, gave approval for the issuance of the cheques. He said that the gesture was to provide succour for the injured workers. The controller called on officers and men in the command to be more dedicated to their duties. Responding on behalf of the beneficiaries, Mr Ombu Michael, whose head and face were stitched due to injuries, expressed gratitude for the gesture. He said that the gesture would encourage the injured workers to be more dedicated to their duties. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the beneficiaries received the cheques through the Correctional Welfare Insurance Scheme (CWIS).
