 THE Senate of the Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo on Monday appointed Prof. Damola Oke, the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Administration), as the acting Vice Chancellor. The Nation gathered that 113 professors attended the emergency Senate meeting where Oke polled 61 votes to defeat Prof. Wahab Elias, the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academics), who got 51 votes. Oke, a Professor of Plant Pathology and former Dean, Faculty of Science, joined LASU as an Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Botany in 1984 and became a Professor in 2004. The Visitor, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, last Friday cancelled the selection process of a substantive VC embarked on by the Council/Senate Selection Committee. The committee had recommended Professors Olumuyiwa Odusanya, Sena Bakre and Kabir Akinyemi to the governor, but he discarded that due to petitions condemning the selection process. The Visitor thereafter mandated the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, to convene an emergency Senate meeting to appoint one of the deputy vice chancellors as acting vice chancellor.
