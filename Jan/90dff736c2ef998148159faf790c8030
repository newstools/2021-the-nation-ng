 Nigerian equities surged forward yesterday as investors reacted positively to the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to hold benchmark interest unchanged at 11.5 per cent. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks share prices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) rose by 1.21 per cent, equivalent to net capital gain of N259 billion. At the end of its two-day meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN yesterday unanimously voted to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and other key parameters at their current rates. Consequently, the committee retained MPR at 11.5 per cent, the asymmetric corridor around the MPR at +100/-700bps, Cash Reserves Ratio at 27.5 per cent and liquidity ratio at 30.0 per cent. Market analysts and investors, who had mostly anticipated that there wouldn’t be change in the apex bank’s policy, opened up market orders to attract deals. Investors are moving funds to quoted equities in response to low yields in the fixed-income markets. Aggregate market capitalisation of all quoted equities at the NSE rose from its opening value of N21.494 trillion to close at N21.753 trillion. The ASI also trended upward from its opening index of 41,088.96 points to close at 41,584.94 points. The positive market situation was driven by widespread gains, especially within the large and medium-cap stocks such as Airtel Africa, Flour Mills of NIgeria, Lafarge Africa and MTN Nigeria Communications.
