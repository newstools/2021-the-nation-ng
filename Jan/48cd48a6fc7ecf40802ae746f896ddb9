 MUKHTAR Sarumi aka Mukhy is set to make a debut in the Nigerian music scene with his first official single titled ‘Julie’. This is following his decision to dump his first-class degree in Chemical Engineering as well as quit his corporate job in the UK last year during the COVID-19 pandemic to focus on his passion – music. Mukhy collaborates with AfroPop singer Glitch to produce his first single which embodies a fun-filled melody built on heavy references and features loads of feel-good energy. According to the 25-year-old Osun State indigene, Mukhy says, “Julie is about “that girl”. Everyone has that girl in their life who they would give everything for – sometimes it is the person you’re with at the moment, but most times it’s someone who got away. I know who my Julie is and if she shows up on the day of my marriage, I’m leaving my wife for her.” Julie was produced by Jaemally Beatz and is out today, January 14th, 2021 on all music platforms.
