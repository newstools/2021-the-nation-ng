The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra) on Wednesday said it will allow controlled use of the anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin to treat Coronavirus (COVID-19). “We will facilitate a controlled, compassionate, access programme for Ivermectin,” said Sahpra CEO Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela, while briefing the National Press Club. “We cannot prove that there is a risk or there is a significant benefit, we have considered that. The framework will be communicated and will be revolving. “We hope the controlled access will enable us that the product is used properly and limit the black market,” she said. She pointed out that more clinical trials needed to be done on Ivermectin since they had limited evidence of its effectiveness. Sahpra will continue to review emerging information that becomes available on the product. There have been calls by politicians, civil society, and some medical professions for the use of Ivermectin describing it as a “wonder drug” with immensely powerful antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents.
