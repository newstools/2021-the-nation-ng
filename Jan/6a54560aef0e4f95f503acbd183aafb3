 Katsina State government has not announced the resumption of schools at the Basic Education level, despite the directive of the Federal Government that schools in the states could resume. An official of the state Ministry of Education, who spoke in confidence with The Nation yesterday, said the state government’s primary concern was to address the security challenges occasioned by the recent abduction and subsequent release of 344 Kankara schoolboys by bandits. He said: “The state government is working hard to provide tight security in schools, particularly those having boarding houses, address also the issue of COVID-19 protocols before announcing their resumption.”
