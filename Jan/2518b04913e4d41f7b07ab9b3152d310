 ALTHOUGH the Chairman of the Caretaker/ Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress, Mai Mala Buni, has been talking tough, promising to sanctions members who sabotage the forthcoming membership registration/revalidation exercise in any way, feelers emanating from some parts of the country indicate that the registration may not pass without some drama. Sentry gathered that Buni’s statement was in reaction to plans by individuals and groups within APC to prevent perceived ‘opponents’ from being registered during the nationwide exercise. “Let me make it abundantly clear that the party would not condone any act of sabotage of denying anyone or group of persons from registering. The party would deal decisively with anyone or group who attempted hijacking the exercise. Everyone must be allowed and given the chance to register. The party has adequate back up materials to ensure a successful exercise and no one is disenfranchised,” Buni said. But he may have to do more than just talk if he truly desires that his warning be taken to heart. Sources tell Sentry that many leaders and their groups are planning to prevent members of rival tendencies within the party in their various states from being registered. There are also those who want to ensure that their own loyalists form the majority of registered members in their domain. They intend to manipulate the exercise to their own advantage. Here’s hoping Buni and his men can walk their talk.
