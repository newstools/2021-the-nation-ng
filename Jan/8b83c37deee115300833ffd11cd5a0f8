Police in Osun have rescued a 20-year-old woman Opeyemi Olatoke from an abandoned house where her father reportedly locked her up for five years. It was learnt that Olatoke was kept in the abandoned house in the Alfa Fire area of Ikirun in Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state. The father of the lady, Samson Olatoke, who was said to have also locked up his son, has been arrested by police. A statement signed by the Women, Children and Social Affairs Commissioner, Olubukola Olaboopo, yesterday said the matter was reported to her office by an NGO, Value Female Network. She said, “The ministry and the police swung into action; we went to the house where the 20-year-old girl was locked up by her father. The father disclosed that he locked up the girl because she was physically challenged. The victim’s mother informed us that Opeyemi’s health started to deteriorate when she shouted from her sleep at age four and since then she was lame.” Olaboopo urged parents to take good care of their children. “The founder of Value Female Network NGO, Dr Aderibigbe Costly,  said Samson Olatoke only fed “the girl once in a while”.
