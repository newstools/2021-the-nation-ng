 BORNO State Governor Babagana Umara Zulum was in Damasak, headquarters of Mobbar Local Government Area in Northern Borno, where he launched the distribution of variety of farm inputs to 1,200 irrigation farmers for the current dry season activities. Zulum, who travelled with the Senator representing Northern Borno, in the Senate Abubakar Kyari who is indigenous to Damasak, distributed water pumps as key components of irrigation, fertiliser, seeds, chemicals and N5, 000 to each of the 1,200 farmers, all of whom will be cultivating rice and onions, among other food crops. The event was facilitated by the Ministry of Agriculture, under its Commissioner, Bukar Talba. Members of the Damasak community led by Senator Kyari, thanked Zulum for his support, even as they expressed their determination to increase food production in line with the governorâ€™s vision for agriculture. Zulum believes that unless resettled communities engage in agricultural activities, there could be problems resulting from unsustainable dependence on food aid from donors.
