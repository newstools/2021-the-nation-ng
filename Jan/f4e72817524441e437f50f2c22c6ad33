CONVICTED former Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia told an Appeal Court on Saturday that 700 million dinars ($5m; £3m), deposited in his account when he was in office, were proceeds from a sale of gold bars. He said ‘emirs of the gulf countries’ gave him 60 gold bars which he sold in an underground market. The former prime minister also admitted to not declaring the proceeds to tax authorities. Ouyahia was prime minister between 2017 and 2019, but his lingering reputation is from the 90s when he implemented austerity measures. He famously told Algerians that ‘people do not need to eat yogurt’ in response to opponents contesting his tough economic measures. Ouyahia and other senior officials who served under ousted President Abdelaiz Bouteflika have been prosecuted and jailed for corruption, money laundering and misappropriation of public funds. He is currently appealing a charge of corruption and misappropriation of public fund in relation to a scandal involving a car assembling group.
