 The Vice Presidential Candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, in 2019 elections, Peter Obi, said he was pained to hear of the death of Joe Erico, a former Nigerian International and Super Eagles’ Assistant coach. Erico was part of the coaching crew that led Super Eagles to the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations tournament held in Mali and also helped qualify Nigeria for the 2002 World Cup. He reportedly died in Lagos, at the age of 71, after a brief illness. In his condolence message, Obi described Erico as a committed sportsman who served the nation well, both as a player and as a coach.  He noted Erico’s coaching exploits that earned him the nickname “Jogo Bonito”, adding Erico’s sacrifices, achievements and legacies in Nigeria’s football sector will always be remembered. Obi condoled with Erico’s family, friends and well-wishers , urging them to accept his death as the will of the Almighty, which cannot be questioned. He further expressed his sincere condolences to the Nigeria Football Federation and football lovers in Nigeria, praying God to give them the fortitude to bear Erico’s death. “May God who has called Joe Erico home, grant him eternal rest,” Obi prayed.
