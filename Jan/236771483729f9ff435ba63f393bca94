RB Leipzig are ready to make a loan move for Premier League duo Kelechi Iheanacho or Divock Origi, according to reports in Germany. The two strikers make up a three-man wish list for the Bundesliga side, who are also targeting a move for Nice’s Kasper Dolberg. According to German news outlet Bild, the Bundesliga club would only be looking to take one of the three men on until the summer. It could be an enticing opportunity for the trio, who have struggled for regular first-team minutes at their clubs this season. Iheanacho has played as Jamie Vardy’s back-up at Leicester but has managed 18 appearances across all competitions this season, while all three of his goals and his two assists came in the Europa League.  The Nigerian also did himself no favours in the Foxes’ 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace last month, missing from the penalty spot in the first half before struggling in front of goal at Selhurst Park. While Iheanacho has had a fair few appearances from the bench, Origi hasn’t been so lucky at Liverpool. The Belgian forward, who is limited to an impact role for Jurgen Klopp’s side, has made just 10 appearances in all competitions, totting up a measly 340 minutes in the process. The 25-year-old has only managed one goal and an assist in that time, which came in the Carabao Cup 7-2 demolition job of Lincoln City back in September.
