 EDO State Governor Godwin Obaseki has said that the state government would deploy the over 800 Police constabulary personnel across the state to enforce strict compliance with the state’s regulations to check the spread of COVID-19. The governor said defaulters would be prosecuted and those found guilty convicted by mobile courts set up across the state. Obaseki, during a news conference in Government House, Benin City, at the weekend, said the state government was strengthening measures to ensure a halt in the spread of the virus. He noted that wearing facemasks in public is compulsory, stating that those convicted by the mobile court would be regarded as ex-convicts. “We are strengthening enforcement of COVID-19 regulations in the state. Those who disobey the regulations, would be made to pay fines and undertake community service. The over 800 police constabularies, who are stationed in each ward in the 18 local governments in the state as well as other security agencies have been charged with enforcing the regulations,” he said. According to the governor, “the battle against COVID-19 involves all of us taking responsibility for our actions. We have all it takes to win this fight and together, we shall overcome. We must be a role model of best practices by wearing face masks consistently and properly; avoiding closed spaces, crowded places, close contacts and ensuring we protect our parents, grandparents and very senior citizens, who are more likely to die if they contract COVID-19.” Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu also said there would be enforcement teams in markets, parks, and other public places to ensure strict compliance.
