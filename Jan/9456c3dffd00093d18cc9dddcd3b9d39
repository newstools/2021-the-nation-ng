Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 election in Enugu State, Senator Ayogu Eze, has said the party would take over the Government House in 2023. Ayogu spoke at the weekend when he presented foodstuff and cash to party members for the New Year. According to him,  two more governors in the Southeast were on their way to join the APC. He said: “A new dawn is about to begin for APC. If we play our card well, we will be in a position to form a new government in Enugu State. We need to lay a good foundation, and if we do, in 2023, APC will form the next government. We are now realigning, we are talking to our brothers and friends in other parties. “We want to strengthen the party structure at the grassroots so that in 2023, APC will form the next government in Enugu State. “We are not relenting, we are talking to our friends across parties and other divides, because you can see that APC is becoming like a beautiful bride in the Southeast, Ebonyi has fallen, Imo has fallen, and I can predict to you that one or two more states will fall very soon. “However, we must show that we are serious and committed. I must identify with the reservations expressed by the party leadership; we have manpower, we have serious personalities but they don’t come close to the party, there is no way we can build a party when all our big guys are not coming together.” Eze added that a president of Igbo extraction was possible with the commitment of members from the region. “We need to work for it as it will not just drop from the roof. We have to work for it and it means building alliances, building friends, because it is not something that we here can do alone. So, let us not try to be cagy and shut our doors. I believe if we work conscientiously, there is something that I see in the horizon coming for this party, but the key is unity,” he added.
