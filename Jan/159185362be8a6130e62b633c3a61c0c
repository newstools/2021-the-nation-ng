RANGERS’ manager Steven Gerrard has explained the club is willing to keep Leon Balogun beyond the 2020-21 season. The 32-year-old defender teamed up with the Ibrox Stadium outfit in the summer of 2020 after leaving Wigan Athletic. The centre-back has been delivering solid performances for the Gers since his arrival, featuring in 18 games across all competitions. His fine showings helped the Ibrox Stadium outfit to their current top spot on the Scottish Premiership table after gathering 62 points from 22 games. Balogun’s one-year contract with the Gers is set to expire at the end of the current season and Gerrard has revealed the club’s desire to hand the Super Eagles star a new deal. “All contract chat will remain private between players and the club once they get up and running,” Gerrard said in a pre-match press conference. “At the right time, we will sit down with Allan McGregor and see what he wants to do in terms of his own future. Leon Balogun is also someone we want to keep a hold off.”
