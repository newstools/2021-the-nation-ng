 AHEAD of the 2022 governorship election in Ekiti State, a staunch loyalist of former governor Ayodele Fayose, Dr. Tope Aluko, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC). Aluko and his supporters were received into the party by the APC state Chairman, Mr. Paul Omotoso, at Ward B Secretariat in Iyin-Ekiti, Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government. Aluko, who led his followers from across the 16 local governments into the APC, said he joined the progressives fold because of the good work of President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Kayode Fayemi. He expressed his readiness to work for the APC to retain Ekiti in the coming 2022 governorship election, saying his joining the party would strengthen it in the state. Aluko, the former PDP state secretary, said he consulted with his former leader, Fayose, whom he described as a mentor and friend, before joining the APC, stressing that the defection wouldn’t affect his relationship with him. He said: “In December last year, I told Fayose that I want to settle down at Iyin-Ekiti and play my politics. With what Governor Fayemi has done for us here, the APC remains the only party here and I have to join the train. I told him I would be joining the APC and he approved it. So, this defection won’t strain our relationship in any way. “I am coming to add value to this party. I am not here to cause trouble. They have given me the guidelines and I am ready to abide by them in the interest of discipline in our party.”
