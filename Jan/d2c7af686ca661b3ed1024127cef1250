Former Super Eagles striker Yakubu Aiyegbeni has declared he won’t apologise to Nigerians over the open goal he missed during the 2010 FIFA World Cup Group B match between Nigeria and South Korea. Aiyegbeni missed a glorious chance to put Nigeria ahead at the must-win group game at Durban Stadium on June 22, 2010 in Durban. Many Nigerians have been angry with the former Portsmouth and Everton striker over the miss. Speaking on Wednesday during an interview tagged Live with Yak on NationTV, Aiyegbeni said he has no apology for the miss. According to him: “I won’t apologise at all. Why should I? I have scored so many goals for Nigeria too. I have sacrificed a lot for the country. Did anyone apologise to me? “I cannot apologise because it wasn’t a deliberate miss. I seriously wanted to score. But it wasn’t to be. So many have strikers have missed chances too and nobody will apologise so I won’t.”
