A three-time ex-commissioner and former Executive Assistant to late Oyo Governor Abiola Ajimobi, Dr Morohunkola Thomas, has stated Governor Seyi Makinde remains popular among the masses despite the security challenges facing the State. He advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) to develop and follow an outstanding strategy to regain power in 2023. Thomas said recent security challenges in the state have done nothing to mar the popularity of Makinde among the masses because he is relating with them in the way they need a Governor. Thomas stated this while featuring on Southwest Political Circuit, an interview programme on Ibadan-based Fresh FM 105.9 at the weekend. He said the APC should not be deceived by the ongoing hullabaloo on security challenges in Oyo State, stressing that Makinde’s popularity remains intact. When asked to assess Makinde, he said the administration is barely 18 months old, explaining that it might be too early to do so. He, however, said: “Let nobody deceive himself, regardless of whatever is happening in the state now, the masses are still with Governor Makinde. “That is the truth of the matter and you have to come to terms with that reality. It does not have to be the elite. But the masses, I can tell you, are still with Makinde. I relate with the masses. I live among them and I know what they are saying. “Anyone who wants to beat Makinde in 2023 must come up with a strategy that is superior to Makinde’s. It is not for me to assess him. But what I am hearing from teachers, civil servants, traders and others is what I have just told you.”
