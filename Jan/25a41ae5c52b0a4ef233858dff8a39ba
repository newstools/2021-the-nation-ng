Wayne Rooney has retired from football after being appointed as Derby County’s new manager. England and Manchester United’s all-time leading goalscorer had been doing the job on a temporary basis following the sacking of Phillip Cocu towards the end of November, but he has now signed a two-and-half-year deal to take charge permanently. Rooney has impressed since stepping into Cocu’s shoes and he has been supported by fellow coaches Liam Rosenior, Shay Given and Justin Walker, who will retain their positions on his staff moving forward. Rosenior takes up the role of assistant manager, while Given will move to the position of first-team coach. Walker will remain as first-team development coach, while academy goalkeeping coach Jason Pearcey has been appointed as the club’s first-team goalkeeping coach. Steve McClaren will continue to assume the duties of technical director and advisor to the board of directors. Rooney said: “When I first arrived back in the United Kingdom I was completely blown away by the potential of Derby County Football Club.
