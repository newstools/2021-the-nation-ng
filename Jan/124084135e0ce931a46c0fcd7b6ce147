 March 13 has finally been picked for the burial of late business mogul, High Chief Olu Benson Lulu-Briggs, after two years of his demise and chaos in his family. Before death, the late Lulu-Briggs was also Paramount Head of Oruwari House of Abonnema. But the controversies and litigations that trailed his demise, including legal tussles in Nigerian and Ghanaian courts over where the deceased truly died and who should take possession of his remains made his burial a long wait. It was also learnt that the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent restrictions by the federal and state governments as regards funerals and large gatherings further elongated the final burial rites. On behalf of the Oruwari Briggs House, Ibim Dokubo, a lawyer, stated that when on December 23, 2019, a High Court in Ghana ruled that the body of the paramount head be released to the family led by Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, the matter was appealed up to the Supreme Court before the body was finally brought on March 16, 2020, in the midst of COVID-19. In his lifetime, Lulu-Briggs was a public servant, labour leader, politician, businessman and philanthropist. All eyes will be on March 13 as the late chiefâ€™s friends and associates have been longing to honour him. Hopefully, the family will come together and give their patriarch a befitting burial rite after years of delay despite interventions by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike and other top personalities.
