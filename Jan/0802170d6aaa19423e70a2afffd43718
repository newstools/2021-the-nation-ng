 Steven Gerrard praised his ‘excellent’ Rangers side as they claimed another three Scottish Premiership points at Aberdeen with specific mentioning of Joe Aribo’s contribution to the team. Speaking to RangersTV after his men made it three wins from three over Granite City club this season, Gerrard said: “Aberdeen is a tough challenge, whether at home or away and we have taken nine points from nine. “I am very pleased with the outcomes of the three games. I felt we were excellent today to get two in front. “I thought we were excellent even before the sending off as we were asking a lot of questions and were really good in possession and our standards and mentality were top. He continued: “I am pleased that we have got our dangerous players on the ball in those areas. I thought the first goal was superb – typical Alfredo and a fantastic finish. “Joe Lewis has made an excellent save from Ryan Kent as well so we have had some other real, big moments in the game, and to come here and create what we did is really pleasing. “But our attacking players were certainly on it tonight. [Joe] Aribo was dangerous, Kent was dangerous, Ianis [Hagi] was always dangerous and I thought he made some great runs without getting put through.”
