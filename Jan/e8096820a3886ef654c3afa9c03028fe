Real Madrid will be looking to make it back-to-back wins in La Liga when they continue their 2020-21 campaign away to a struggling Osasuna tonight. Los Blancos are currently second in the table, two points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, while Osasuna occupy 19th  position, having only picked up 14 points from their opening 16 games of the season. Osasuna have won three, drawn five and lost eight of their 16 league matches this season to collect 14 points, which has left them down in 19th spot, just two points ahead of basement side Huesca. Los Rojillos are not in a disastrous position considering that they are just two points from the safety of 17th  with a game in hand, but there is no getting away from the fact that it has been a disappointing season to date. Jagoba Arrasate’s side, who finished 10th  in La Liga last season, returned to this level of football in 2019 courtesy of winning the Segunda Division and will be determined to consolidate in the top flight. Osasuna have not actually won in the league since beating Athletic Bilbao on October 24, but they have shared the points in their last three matches with Elche, Alaves and Real Sociedad. Arrasate’s team will enter this weekend’s contest off the back of a win, meanwhile, having scored three unanswered goals against Olot in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday night.
