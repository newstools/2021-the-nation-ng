The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has promoted 19 personnel in its Eket Unit Command in Akwa Ibom. The Unit Commander, Asst. Corps Cdr. Adebayo Gboyega, decorated the personnel on Thursday in Eket with a charge that they must not bring shame to the corps. He expressed delight that all the personnel who went for the last promotion examination from the unit were promoted. “This is the only time that those who went for promotion examination were all promoted,” Gboyega said. He said that the affected personnel were promoted to the ranks of superintendent route commander, route commander, assistant chief inspector, chief road marshal assistant and senior road marshal assistant. Gboyega advised the newly-promoted personnel to be more committed and dedicated to duties in order to achieve the mission of the corps. “Promotion means additional responsibility and total loyalty to the corps. The higher you go, the more you are expected to be committed to your duties. “To whom much is given, much is expected. Your loyalty to the corps should not be doubted. “Don’t bring shame to the corps, rather do all possible to justify your promotion,” Gboyega said. He advised them to respect their seniors. Responding on behalf of the newly-promoted personnel, Mrs. Imaobong James, expressed appreciation to God for their success in the promotion examination. “It is God that promotes, promotion comes from God and not from any man; so we return all glory to God for making today a reality,” she said. James thanked the unit commander for creating an enabling environment for the personnel to work well. NAN
