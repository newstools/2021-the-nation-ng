 Three Nigerian athletes were in action at the American Track League I, the first leg of the World Indoor Tour in Fayetteville, all churning out very impressive performances in their events. Blessing Okagbare who hadn’t competed indoors since she last won the NCAA 60m title in 2010, opened up her season, racing to a Personal Best (PB) of 7.17s to win the race. She got a rebound over Jamaica’s Christiania Williams who had edged her out in qualification, with the latter returning 7.18s, same as she did in the heats for second place overall. Meanwhile, Kayla White pipped Morolake Akinosun over the finish for third as they both were timed 7.20s, a PB for Akinosun. On to the men’s 60m, Divine Oduduru after winning his heat in 6.70s, clocked a Season’s Best (SB) of 6.65s to finish second to Trayvon Bromell who powered to a blistering World Lead (WL) of 6.48s for a thorough win. Chukwuebuka Enekwechi also got his 2021 campaign going as he hurled an SB of 20.65m to finish second in the men’s Shot Put. The event was won by Ryan Crouser who pulled an astonishing indoor World Record (WR) of 22.82m, breaking the previous record of 22.60m that had been set by Randy Barnes since 1989.
