 Hair entrepreneur, Oluwakemi Juba, has explained how her affinity for hair extension at the age of 12 turned into owning a hair company. Juba, the brain behind Kojhairways, said she founded the business in 2015 due to her love for beauty, especially hair. “So many things inspired me into selling hairs. I love dealing with anything called beauty. I have lots of businesses but the business I am known for is my hair business,” she quipped. Selling all types and shades of hair extensions including fibre wigs, Juba said, “I realised I needed to do something else and extensions were the thing that kept coming up because I had worn them since I was 12.” She further said though she grew up in a strict family where she wasn’t allowed to wear anything make-up or dye her hair as part of fashion, her mother permitted the use of hair extensions. “Extensions for some reasons, my mum was fine with. The first time I wore them, it was an immediate confidence boost. They became this cloak of power. A lot of women have the same thing. It doesn’t have to be over the top.” Speaking further on how she started her business, the Sagamu, Ogun State-born said she was grateful for the opportunity offered by Instagram. “It is called moving with the trend – that Instagram gave us all the opportunity to own an online store and be self-confident. “It started from there and today, we are in almost all the states of the federation and we are prompt in delivery to our customers. “We welcome their complaints and we try to improve in the areas where we are lacking, they are the reason why we are still in business to date.” Oluwakemi Juba, a graduate of Business Administration from the Tai Solarin University of Education has her hair company’s head office located in Lagos.
