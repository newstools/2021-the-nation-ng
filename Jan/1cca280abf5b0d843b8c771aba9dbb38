After returning to action following 77 days absence due to shoulder injury coupled with COVID-19, Victor Osimhen has said that he was happy being part of the Napoli’s team that lost 3-1 away to Hellas Verona on Sunday. Amidst the doubt over the future of Coach Gennaro Gattuso at Naples, Osimhen who was the only player that commented after the loss to Verona believes the team would bounce back from the defeat. Commenting on his social media, the Nigerian striker said: “We are united in victory as in defeat, happy to be back … we move. ” Meanwhile, Gattuso’s future at Napoli is reportedly uncertain, with Rafael Benitez mentioned as the possible successor. La Stampa reports President Aurelio De Laurentiis has asked for a meeting face to face with sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli after the 3-1 defeat to Hellas Verona in Serie A. Napoli are currently sixth in the League, through to the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia and the round of 32 in the Europa League. The newspaper claims the coach’s position could be the topic when the patron and the director meet, as the Partenopei also lost the Supercoppa Italiana against Juventus last week. Benitez, who coached Napoli between 2013 and 2015, has recently freed himself from Dalian in China and the report claims he could return to Naples. But Sky Sport Italia reported yesterday that Gattuso has faith from the board.
