 THE Borno State government has enrolled 1,163 children of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), in schools in Mobbar Local Government Area. Special Adviser to Governor Babagana Zulum on Communications and Strategy, Malam Isa Gusau said in a statement issued in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital yesterday, that the enrolment was supervised by Zulum in Damasak, headquarters of Mobbar Local Government Area during a three-day visit to the area. He added that the measure was part of efforts to ensure that all children of school age were enrolled in school. He said the governor was on a three-day visit to LGAs along the shores of Lake Chad for schools enrolment and other humanitarian support to returnees. “In the third and final day of Zulum’s trip to Damasak, 1,163 children of IDPs were enrolled in primary schools as part of the governor’s enrolment campaigns. “The pupils, who were from Guzamala and Abadam local government areas in Northern Borno had been out of school since their parents were displaced by Boko Haram insurgents when they attacked their communities. “Zulum appealed to parents to allow their children to enrol in schools, saying that there were functional schools provided by the government,” he said. The governor said social welfare and other assistance from the government will be restricted to parents who allowed their children to attend schools. “Zulum also launched the distribution of water pumps, fertilisers, seeds, chemicals and N5, 000 cash support for 1,200 irrigation farmers to enable them to embark on food cultivation during the current dry season. “The governor also supervised the distribution of food combination to 10,000 IDP families. “Each of the 10,000 families received 25kg of rice, 25kg of beans, 25kg of maize and five litres of cooking oil as part of interventions before they can generate livelihoods for themselves in Damasak,” Gusau said. Damasak, a border community was a stronghold of Boko Haram terrorists.
