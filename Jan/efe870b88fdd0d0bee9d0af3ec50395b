 In line with its long-standing commitment to support its stakeholders and communities, the Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) Limited, has donated a newly built a block of classrooms to LEA Primary School in Karon Magiji, Abuja. Speaking during the formal handover of the tastefully finished blocks, the District Head, Chief Yunusa Bako Abdullahi, commended the gesture by the foremost consumer packaged goods company and bottlers of Coca-Cola products in Nigeria, saying the community would continue to cherish the support. “What NBC has done for LEA Primary school is very commendable, particularly because building a decent learning environment for our pupils had been a major challenge for us. We consider this a major investment in the future of our children, the leaders of tomorrow,” he said. Similarly, Headmistress of the school, Mrs. Abigael Eulus, described the new classroom blocks as a major relief for the pupils who hitherto, had been learning in overcrowded classrooms. Public Affairs and Communications Director, Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC), Mr. Ekuma Eze said over the years the company has continued to lead the charge in private sector contributions towards education and human capital development in Nigeria, doing so through a wide range of interventions.
