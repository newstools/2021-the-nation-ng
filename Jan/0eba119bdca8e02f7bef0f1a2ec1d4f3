Coach Gernot Rohr has lamented the absence of Super Eagles B from the on-going African Nations Championship in Cameroon  even as he  predicted stiff competition for shirts ahead of the remaining 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho in March. However, Rohr said he has been monitoring the players featuring in the domestic league despite the  absence of the local-based  Super  at  the CHAN Tournament. “We are watching the league games with the NPFL link,” he said. “We are also actually watching the CHAN competition in Cameroon where our local players unfortunately did not qualify.” But with most of the injured players now back in action with their European clubs, Rohr presumed that the Super Eagles’ ‘complexity’ would change so that competition for shirts would be keenly contested in the forthcoming international engagements. The Super Eagles will play away to Benin Republic on March 22 and round off their 2021 AFCON qualifying campaign in a home match against Lesotho on March 30. Rohr  told NationSport that the Super Eagles would be solid  against their Group L rivals in the remaining ties , adding he was keeping tab with his wards: “We have 35 players in our scouting list and analyse every weekend their performances. “The decisive qualifiers will come soon and it’s the moment to count on our complicity. Ndidi, Kalu, Simon, Etebo and others will be back after injury and make the competition for the starting team very interesting,” noted the former Bordeaux coach.
