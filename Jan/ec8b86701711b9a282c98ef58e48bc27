  The Stade Charles De Gaulles De Porto Novo in neighbouring  Republic of Benin  will now host the outstanding CAF Confederation Cup tie  between Rivers United and South African side Bloemfontein Celtic . Media officer of the Port Harcourt-based side Mayuku Charles  confirmed as much adding the match   will be held  on January 23rd  as against 24th  earlier reported. Celtic were due to play Rivers United in Port Harcourt last week but did not travel after the Nigerian government refused to waive strict coronavirus regulations which required Celtic to be quarantined for seven days upon arrival. South Africa has been designated as a high risk country by Nigeria and all travellers must quarantine. Following CAF’s directive, Rivers United were mandated  to secure a  neighbouring  venue   for the  return leg after the  tie originally billed for January 6 was called off .
