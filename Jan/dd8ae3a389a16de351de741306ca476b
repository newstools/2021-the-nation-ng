Subscribers to national telecoms operator, Globacom, now have more channels to make it much easier for them to link their phone numbers to their National Identity Numbers (NIN). Apart from the first method of sending their NIN to 109, which Globacom announced earlier, subscribers have three more ways of competing the NIN update process. “We have further simplified the process for our esteemed customers to link their National Identification Number (NIN) to their mobile numbers by giving them more options to conduct the process. “Now, they can simply text their NIN to 109 or use any of these options: they can dial *109# or *109*your NIN# directly. Customers can also call 109 to update their NIN via voice call,” Globacom explained.  For those who do not have their NIN, the operator said they could dial *346# to retrieve the number if they have already registered with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). Customers without a NIN are reminded to visit any NIN enrolment center to get one. Globacom subscribers with  enquiries were  urged to contact any of its customer contact channels or visit https://www.gloworld.com/ng/nin  for support.
