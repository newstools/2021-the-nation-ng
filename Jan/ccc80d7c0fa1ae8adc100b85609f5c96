Singer Simi has celebrated her husband, Adekunle Gold, who clocks 34 on Thursday. She took to her Instagram handle to share a lovely photo of herself and husband. The mum of one wrote: “My baby. We’re growing older together and it’s exactly what I’d hoped it would be. “May you never lose your wonder, your big belly-laughs (and your industry laugh), your dreams, your joy, your love, your peace, your grace, your smiles, your hope. May the world be good to you. May God stay blessing you. May wisdom abide with you. May you stay beautiful, because you’re too vain to be basic tbh. “I love you so much. Happy birthday my lover na friend. Issa full birthday weekend. Periodt!”
