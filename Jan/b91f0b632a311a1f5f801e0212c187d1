 CHAIRMAN of Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Dr Joan Oviawe has described the Godwin Obaseki-led administration as the most teacher-friendly government in Nigeria. According to her, primary school teachers in Edo were among the best well-treated in the country. Her stand is following the proposed indefinite strike of teachers scheduled to start January 18. Oviawe, who spoke on Thursday in Benin, noted that the take-home pay of teachers was more than that of an average civil servant. She said: “There is no basis for the planned January 18 strike by teachers as Governor Obaseki has done so much for them. “Edo State does not have any issue with anybody. The government has been pro-teachers. Only three of the 18 councils owe primary school teachers.” Oviawe hinted that SUBEB had trained 11,400 teachers in the last two years. She said Edo was the only state in Nigeria that had trained such high number of teachers. She also said community-based teachers would be recruited and trained this year.
