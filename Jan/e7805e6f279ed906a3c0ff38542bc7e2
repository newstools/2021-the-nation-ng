 THE Ekiti State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged Governor Kayode Fayemi to face governance and stop junketing about in a bid to actualise his ‘utopian’ 2023 presidential ambition. It said the rising spate of insecurity and alleged misgovernance of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration would have been a thing of the past if Governor Fayemi had focused on governance rather than dissipating energy on 2023 politics. The opposition party, in a statement yesterday by the factional state Publicity Secretary, Raphael Adeyanju, said Fayemi must rise up to the task of providing good governance and making lives better for the people rather than fighting for presidential ticket, which had no meaning to the Ekiti people. The party, which lamented the growing level of insecurity, accused the governor of abandoning Ekiti State for armed bandits to take over and operate without any hinderance. Reacting, APC described the opposition party’s vituperation as a ranting of paranoid people, who are only perfectionist at spreading gospel of bare-faced lies.
