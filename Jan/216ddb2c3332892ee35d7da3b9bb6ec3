For the past few days, it’s been all celebration in the household Chief Razak Okoya, owner of Eleganza Group of companies. On Tuesday, January 12, the industrialist and his wife, Shade Okoya, had two reasons to celebrate – the Aare of Lagos turned 81 and their pretty daughter, Resheeda, turned 20. Although it was a modest celebration by all standards of the Okoyas due to rise in COVID-19 cases, they still found a way to have fun. Family members and celebrant were thrilled with indigenous performances such as eulogy, dance and poetry by a cultural group. Taking to social media, the billionaire’s beautiful wife showered accolades on the duo. The socialite labelled her husband and daughter her two favourite people in the world, adding she was lucky they shared the same day.
