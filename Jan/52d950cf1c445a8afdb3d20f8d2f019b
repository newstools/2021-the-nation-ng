 The CEO of Monimichelle Group, Ebi Egbe, has  urged the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the several oil companies operating in the Niger Delta region to queue behind  its sports development, Egbe who bankrolls  a tourney for  the riverine Apoi communities of Southern Ijaw local government of Bayelsa State, said he decided to sponsor the Apoi Unity Cup won by Ogboin United of Ogboinbiri, as a way of  combating militancy amongst the youths “I’ m out to change the narrative of Southern Ijaw being the hotbed of militancy and  I’m confident sports, especially football can be used to redirect the energy of the youths. “Egbe explained. “Rather than engage in militancy, I want them(youths)  to be engaged in football. The kind of mammoth crowd that watched the matches, especially the final was a clear indication that with sports, the youths of Apoi will become worthy Ambassadors of Nigeria.” Egbe promised to make the tournament an annual event that can only get bigger and better even as he rallied for the support of the NDDC  and oil companies operating in the region to bolster  the tournament. “If the NDDC and the oil companies put just 10 percent of what they are using to fight militancy into sports and the provision of sporting infrastructure in Southern Ijaw, there would be nothing like militancy anymore,” noted  Egbe.“ I can put my money on this because we all know the power of football, especially in the Niger Delta region where soccer talents abound.”
