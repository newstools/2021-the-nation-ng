Leaders of the Ondo State Peoples Democratic Party are to meet to take a definite position ahead of the South Zonal Congress. A chieftain of the Ondo PDP, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, who is contesting for the National Vice Chairman of the PDP at the congress, has the backing of former Governor Ayodele Fayose. But some Ondo PDP leaders including the state executive are in tune with the Governor Seyi Makinde leadership of the South West PDP. Fayose and Makinde are at loggerheads over who is the leader of the PDP n the South West region. State Chairman of the Ondo PDP, Fatai Adams, who gave the hint about the meeting in an interview said the PDP remained intact, solid and united. According to him, “We are solid in unity, solid in understanding and political strategy. There is nothing like clash among us. The fact that you have ambition does not mean clash. “Governor Seyi Makinde remains the leader of the party in the South West. Nobody is disputing that. As soon as the leaders agree and give us a date, we will be at the Zonal Congress and perform our constitutional duties. “We don’t have anything against any of our sons contesting any position at the Zonal Congress. We are very intact in Ondo PDP. Before the zonal congress, all of us will seat down and agree on our position.”
