Super Eagles Manager Gernot Rohr, has offered his support to Victor Osimhen and has backed the Napoli striker to bounce back from his present predicament. Osimhen, who lost his father last year, turned 22 in December and was allowed by his club boss to travel back to Nigeria and spend the time with his family. Upon returning to Italy, the Nigerian forward was tested and found to be infected with the dreaded COVID-19 virus, even though he was asymptomatic. However, his troubles started when a video surfaced online showing Osimhen at a party with people who showed little or no respect for the COVID-19 protocols of social distancing and wearing of nose masks. The former Lille star has since offered his apologies to the club, coach and fans but Napoli are still expected to sanction the player for his recklessness. But Rohr, Osimhen’s international coach, believes what happened was a genuine error which the player deeply regrets. “You know Victor, he is young, he is very humble,” Rohr told ESPN. “This was for him a mistake, but he will learn, and he will be strong after.” The Franco-German is also impressed with how Osimhen’s club boss Gattuso has handled the matter, which shows the Italian tactician’s respect for the youngster. Rohr added: “When you have a good player, who is very humble and he makes a mistake, you try to help him. “Also, the coach (Gattuso) respects him, that is why he will speak to him to help him.” Osimhen missed Napoli’s 2-1 victory at the weekend as he continues to self isolate following his COVID-19 status.
