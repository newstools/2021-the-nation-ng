 CHAIRMAN of the Senate Committee on Army Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume (Borno South) on Thursday kicked off an empowerment programme for 1,200 women, some of whose husbands were killed by Boko Haram insurgents. The women, selected from Biu, Hawul, Kwaya, Bayo and Shani local government areas, received grinding machines, sewing machines and cash gifts. A statement by Ndume’s media office in Abuja explained that Borno State Deputy Governor Umar Kadafur handed over the items to the women. He was assisted by his wife, Maimuna. The empowerment held at the Ambassador Lodge in Biu. The statement added that Ndume’s wife, Maryam, also donated electricity transformer to the people of Galtimari ward in Biu. Kadafur appealed to beneficiaries not to sell the items but use them for the purpose they are meant for. The second phase of empowerment would hold in Askira/Uba for about 600 women of Chibok, Damboa and Gwoza councils.
