Umar Sadiq scored two goals as Almeria cruised into the next round of the Copa del Rey with a 5-0 victory over Deportivo Alaves on Saturday. The 23-year-old fired the Segunda Division outfit ahead in the eighth minute, after benefitting from Jose Corpas’ assist. Some moments before half-time, Sadiq made it 3-0 for the hosts a few seconds after Ager Aketxe doubled their lead. The former Roma youngster has now scored five goals in his last two matches for Jose Gomes’ side after he grabbed a hat-trick against Ponferradina a fortnight ago. Rodrigo Battaglia’s own goal and Juan Villar’s spot-kick later in the second half completed the rout for the Rojiblancos, who have now won their last three matches. Sadiq was in action for 74 minutes, and he has been playing a crucial role in Almeria’s push for La Liga promotion with 11 goals in all competitions since he moved to Spain from Partizan Belgrade in October. The Nigeria youth star is Almeria’s leading scorer in the Segunda Division with nine goals in 18 league appearances so far this campaign.
