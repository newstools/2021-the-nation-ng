  Oleksandr Usyk has not agreed to step aside and allow Anthony Joshua to fight rival Tyson Fury for the undisputed heavyweight championship next. IBF, WBA and WBO champion Joshua and WBC belt holder Fury are currently in the midst of discussions for a super fight this year, in a fight that would be one of the biggest in the history of boxing. However, the biggest spanner in the works for Joshua and his promoter Eddie Hearn is the Ukrainian challenger Usyk, who is the mandatory challenger for AJ’s WBO belt. Usyk beat Derek Chisora to earn his chance to fight for the heavyweight belt, after he vacated all of the cruiserweight titles as the undisputed champion and moved up in weight. His mandatory status means Joshua will either have to fight Usyk first or vacate the WBO title in order to secure an all-British showdown with Fury However, Usyk’s promoter Alexander Krassyuk said that his fighter has no intention of stepping aside and is ready to fight for the title shot he’s earned. He told Sky Sports: “According to now the deadline is more for Fury and AJ not for Usyk.
“There were talks about an interim title or the AJ vs. Fury winner relinquishing the WBO title the next day [after they fight]. “But as for today Usyk is the WBO mandatory and never gave his consent for the [Joshua vs. Fury] bout to happen without him. “Usyk is in good condition now; he successfully recovered from his last fight and looks forward to challenging the title this spring. “A non-title fight has never been under discussion and I really hope it will never be.” Despite this, Joshua remains optimistic of finalising a deal with Fury and getting the opportunity to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in the early 2000s.
