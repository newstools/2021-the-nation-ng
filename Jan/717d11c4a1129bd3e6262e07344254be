Ekiti State Commissioner of Police Babatunde Mobayo has dismissed insinuations that the sack of Corporal Olajide Omolola from the Force for getting pregnant amounted to an infringement of her rights. Mobayo was addressing newsmen in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, on Thursday, noting that the police acted in the best interest of the Force. Omolola, who was attached to the Iye Ekiti Police Station in Ilejemeje area of Ekiti State, was dismissed last week for getting pregnant barely a year after graduating from the police academy. Mobayo said that the corporal flagrantly violated section 127 of the police Act by getting pregnant outside marriage, which he said carries punitive measures against any defaulters. “In the police organisation, we have rules and regulations, which are being carried out within the ambit of the constitution. The police officers are not even allowed to keep their children that are above 18 years of age in the barracks. Some of these laws were taught in the police colleges before we graduated. “If you are in Police College you are not supposed to get pregnant. When you pass out, you still need basic trainings for your attention not to be distracted; you must spend a certain period of time before you get married for you to perform efficiently. “The lady in question passed out May, 2020, which is eight months ago and now she is with six months pregnancy. The Police Act 2020, which is undergoing amendment in the Senate has not repealed. She had contravened Section 127 of the police regulation. Section 126 of the regulation states that a married policewoman who is pregnant may be granted maternity leave, while Section 127 says an unmarried policewoman who becomes pregnant shall be discharged from the Force and shall not be enlisted except with the approval of the IGP.
