The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, has said that anybody with COVID-19 virus that enters the Iwo community will be automatically healed. The monarch also prayed for an end to COVID-19 pandemic, urging Nigerians to adhere to all safety protocols by the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC). Oluwo, speaking in a ceremony to mark his 5th anniversary on the throne, said ‘God has bestowed power on kings to legislate on his behalf on earth and I want to thank God that he has been supporting me since I became the king of this ancient town. Within the five years of my reign, the community has witnessed a series of developments. My subjects are living happily and healthy. We did not have any issue of Coronavirus. Anybody with COVID-19 that enters Iwo will be automatically healed. “I pray for you as I am celebrating five years on the throne that all stagnations, poverty, and sickness of all my subjects shall come to an end. By extension, the same way that none of my subjects contract Coronavirus, I pray that the pandemic will cease in all parts of this country and our economy will bounce back.” The Emir of Bichi Emirate, Nasiru Ado Bayero and Olofa of Offa, Oba Mufutau Gbadamonsi, who were among the guests that graced the occasion, lauded the monarch for bringing development into the community and implored the residents to support the monarch and the Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, for them to bring more infrastructural development in the town.
