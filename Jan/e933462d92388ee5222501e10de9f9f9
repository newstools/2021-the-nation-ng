 Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers is particularly thrilled with the partnership between Wilfred Ndidi and Belgian international Youri Tielemans in the midfield of Leicester City. The midfield has given Leicester a substantial base in the middle of the pitch from which to play forwards and attack with menace. Rodgers admitted that the manner in which the Ndidi combines with the Belgian in central midfield is particularly useful to the team and Rodgers believes the pair complement one another with their contrasting playing styles. “They play different roles,” the 47-year-old said. “This is the beauty of this league, there’s so much diversity in terms of styles you play against and systems too. “You have to have flexibility, but those two really complement each other. Wilf had a great game the other night in a high-intensity game with lots of duels, where you’ve got to win your headers, got to be strong, got to be aggressive, got to cover ground. Youri does that too but then [Ndidi] can pass it to Youri and he can play the forward passes. “There’s a great combination there between the two. If you can get that in one player, he’s probably worth £150M. They both have their own strengths and they complement each other very well.”
