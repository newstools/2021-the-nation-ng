National Association of Private Proprietors of Schools (NAPPS), Imo branch has established Covid-19 taskforce to complement the state government in a bid to check the spread of the virus in schools. Disclosing this to the Nation in Owerri, the Imo State capital, the Chairman of the association, Joe Mbakwe, said that the introduction of the taskforce would complement the state government taskforce led by Prof. Maurice Iwu to check the spread of the virus in the state. “This is a way to show the world that Imo State private schools are 90 per cent ready to check the spread of the virus in private schools in the state,” he added. Mbakwe, who is the proprietor of Sure Foundation Modern Schools, Avutu, De Sam Mbakwe Campus, noted that the virus though deadly has come to stay with the people, adding that the best Federal Government could do now is to come out with taskforce that would ensure compliance of the preventive measures than to lock down the country the second time. He said the last year lockdown had adverse effect on private schools in the country, adding that the education sector suffered a lot of backwardness. “If we don’t run normal school calendar, it will be a disaster to the sector. We made a lot of sacrifices for the last lockdown last year to ensure that we compressed two sessions together. Any lock down again will collapse the school system. “What we need now is to make sure everybody complies with the protocols. We must adhere and adjust to the preventive measures. “If Nigeria is a developed country that has gone far with e-learning or online education in our educational system, we can also be thinking in that direction. But with my experience of over 20 years, no state including Imo is up to 10 per cent e-learning compliance. So the best is the normal conventional classroom learning,” he stated.
