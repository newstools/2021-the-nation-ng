Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has revealed why he missed Gunners’ last two games. The Gabon attacker was not involved in their two games against Southampton, an FA Cup loss and a Premier League win. Aubameyang stated that his mother has been experiencing health issues, adding that was why he took time off to attend to her. He wrote on Twitter: “Hey guys, thank you so much for all the messages and calls over the last few days. “My mother is going through some health issues and I had to be there for her. She’s already much better now and I will be back. I’m more than grateful to the doctors and nurses helping her get through this. “And of course, thanks to my Arsenal fans for the love! I’m more determined than ever to keep our momentum going! “Thank you all again – I really am beyond blessed to receive this level of support and love from all of you and I can’t wait to be back.”
