The Board of Trustees of the Vigilante Group of Nigeria (VGN) has stated that it stands by the leadership of Dr. Usman Mohammad Jahun. This follows a leadership tussle and claims to the position of Commander-In-Chief/National Chairman of the group. In a press release signed by the board’s chairman, Alhaji Ahmed Dalhatu, and its National Legal Adviser, Barrister A. A. Manta, the board also sounded a note of warning to those taking advantage of the current situation to desist and respect the decision of the board of trustees. Recall that there has been a leadership tussle between Dr. Usman Jahun and Ali Sokoto of blessed memory. According to the press release, the Court of Appeal, sitting in Kaduna Judicial Division had ruled in favour of Dr. Usman Mohammed Jahun as far back as December 2019, making him the authentic Commander-General. In another development, another member of the group, Alhaji Bakori Umar, who was Chief of Staff to late Sokoto, is claiming leadership of the security group. During a phone interview with our reporter, Bakori attested to the Court of Appeal judgment, which ruled in favour of Jahun but insisted there is another suit filed against Jahun’s authenticity at the Supreme Court, which makes him the group’s National Coordinator. Bakori also stated that all documents of VGN, including its original certificate and documents of its account are in his custody. Jahun, reacting to this, however said Bakori is keeping the documents illegally, as they should be in the custody of the board of trustees. He said he took advantage of Sokoto’s death to take custody of them. “Bakori does not have any right to be in possession of those documents. They should be with the BOT. He only took them at the resident of Late Ali Sokoto. Even before Sokoto’s demise, I won the case at the Court of Appeal and therefore remain the National Coordinator of The Vigilante Group of Nigeria”, Jahun said.
