Enyimba international will be without inspirational captain Austin Oladapo for the all-important CAF Champions League clash with El-Merreikh on Wednesday. Oladapo in a chat with brila.net confirmed he won’t be part of the Enyimba’s squad as he continue to recover from ankle injury. “I won’t take part in the game, I’m not 100 percent fit, although i returned to training yesterday but the game is coming too soon for me,” he said to brila.net.  Oladapo has missed Enyimba’s last two matches, including the first leg defeat in Omdurman and last week’s NPFL game with Abia Warriors. The People’s Elephant are at the risk of missing out of the lucrative group phase of the CAF Champions League after trailing 3 – 0 from the first leg. Failure to overturn the score line, means the two times winners will drop to the CAF Confederation Cup.
