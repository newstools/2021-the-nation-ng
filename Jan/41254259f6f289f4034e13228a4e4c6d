 IMO State has vowed to prosecute all illegal revenue collectors and people who fail to wear facemasks in public places. Governor Hope Uzodimma gave the warning on Thursday after the State Executive Council (SEC). He said recent reports on the activities of illegal revenue collectors, and abuse of the Nigerian Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) protocol, call for drastic measures to check the trend. He also reiterated the governmentâ€™s initial warning to revenue agencies that the use of consultants for collection of government revenue was abolished. Uzodimma warned that any person(s) caught collecting revenue for government under whatever guise will be arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned.
