 SINCE emerging the first winner of the MTN Y’ello Star talent and music reality TV show, Oladotun ‘Dotti’ Okeowo has been up to so many things. Investigations conducted revealed that the 26-year-old has been making visitations to media houses and top dignitaries. Still basking in the euphoria of 2020, Dotti had performed at the virtual MTN end of the year party. He serenaded the staff of the teleco with his tunes before calling it a day. Dotti was also spotted with the Oyo State Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Seun Fakorede. The budding music star visited the commissioner as part of his courtesy visit and media tour of Oyo state. Dotti’s winnings include a house with an in-built studio, a new car, and a five million naira cash prize. He will also write and record a song under the professional tutelage of six-time Grammy award winner, Malik Yusef, at the Power Studio in New York. The top six finalists will attend the summer music programme at the Berklee College of Music in the United States.
