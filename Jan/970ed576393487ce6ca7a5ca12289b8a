  Former Spurs, Aston Villa and Sunderland striker Darren Bent is not carried away by the recent display by Alex Iwobi at Everton while the Englishman claimed that the Nigerian does not show his talent on a more regular basis. In an interview with Football Insider, Bent suggested that the former Arsenal ace needs to perform on a more consistent basis: “That’s the issue with him, that he doesn’t do it every week. “He flatters to deceive every now and then and the quality isn’t always there with the final ball, sometimes he doesn’t even take up the invitation. “We know he’s got endeavour, we know he works hard but at times he’s got to add quality to his game. If he does that, I think he’ll be a lot more effective.” In 48 games in total in all competitions for the Merseyside club over the last two consecutive seasons, Iwobi has only managed to score four goals and make just four assists and he faces stiff competition to stake a regular place in the team.
