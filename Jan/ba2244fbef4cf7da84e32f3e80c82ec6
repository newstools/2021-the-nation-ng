 ONE of the music acts signed to Naira Marley’s music label, Zinolesky says his boss is an intellectual. He said, “So, you know it’s a family thing, he’s a very intellectual person that looks at all angles, spiritually every angle left, morally.” In a recent chat with DJ Cuppy on Apple Music 1, Zinolesky, who has two hit singles, says being an artist on Marlian music is an experience. “Being signed to Marlian Music is, trust me, an experience like no other. Because Naira Marley doesn’t take us as an artist, this is like his brother or his brother like his family,” he said during the chat. Currently making waves with his new single, ‘Kilofeshe,’ off his debut EP, ‘Chrome,’ the 25-year-old strongly believes being on Naira Marley’s imprint is a perfect decision. “I think I’m in a perfect place, perfect place, and I’m very happy I made that decision.”
