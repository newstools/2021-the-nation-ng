Anambra State House of Assembly complex has been shut down, following a COVID -19 scare. Security operatives have taken over the arena to prevent workers and visitors from entering the premises. It was reported in the social media that some lawmakers and workers of the Assembly tested positive to COVID -19, which led to the closure of the complex. But, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Okechukwu Okoye, has debunked the rumour of coronavirus pandemic in the Assembly Okoye, who described the reports as “dangerous rumour”, said there was no iota of truth in such stories. However, the lawmaker said the complex was shut because of government policy to fumigate some public buildings in the state as a preventive measure against diseases, including COVID-19. According to him, “there is no iota of truth in the story. This is a dangerous rumour. The truth is that Governor Willie Obiano is fumigating public institutions in the state as a preventative measure against diseases, especially COVID-19. “The governor started the exercise at the secretariat. Now, it’s the assembly complex. “That’s why we vacated the place and asked workers to also vacate for two weeks because of the toxicity of the fumigation. “Nobody has tested positive for COVID19  in the assembly to the best of my knowledge.”
