  For Dakuku Adol Peterside, the immediate past Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), yesterday was not just the end of a tumultuous year; he clocked fifty. In two decades, Peterside has been local government chairman, he has been a commissioner, he has been a legislator and he has led a federal agency. He sure has packed so much into his youthful years. As NIMASA boss, his era was the first time the agency would remit huge sums in dollars into the Federation Account. It shared this record with the Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB). Before then, the agency’s image was in tatters. Many saw it as where to go for free cash. In a matter of weeks, Peterside, who holds a doctorate degree from the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, will launch a book ‘Strategic Turnaround’ detailing the strategy used by his team (which included his successor, Dr. Bashir Jamoh) to breathe fresh air into the agency. I have had more than a peep into the book and believe it is worth watching out for. As he begins his 51st journey on earth, I pray God will grant him his heart’s desires.
