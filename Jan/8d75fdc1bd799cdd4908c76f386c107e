 FOLLOWING last week’s fire incident that razed Sokoto Central Market, the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has donated N50 million to the Sokoto State government and victims of the fire incident with a resolve to lobby the Federal Government to fulfil its pledge of assisting in the rebuilding of the market. Chairman of the Forum and Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi announced the donation on Tuesday in Sokoto when the forum visited the market. The governor was in company of the Chairman Northern States Governors’ Forum, Simon Bako Lalong and Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar of  Jigawa State. Fayemi said the NGF will pursue the pledge made by the Federal Government to the state government and victims of the blaze.
