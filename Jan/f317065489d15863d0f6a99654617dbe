The Nigerian Institution of Structural Engineers (NIStructE) has elected the Deputy Rector (Academics), Yaba College of Technology (Yabatech), Dr. Kehinde Osifala as its 20th President. The investiture, which took place at YABATECH, attracted dignitaries in the engineering field. The Rector, Mr. Obafemi Omokungbe, an engineer, congratulated NIStructE and Osifala. He described it as an honour for the YABATECH community to have one of the institution’s best brains and seasoned administrators run the affairs of the prestigious institute. Omokungbe said Osifala had in his 36 years in YABATECH contributed immensely to the academic and administrative development of the college. He assured NIStructE that Osifala would bring in the desired development to the profession and raise the quality of service of the institution. The Rector said the institute played a critical role in national development and safety and such should regulate the structural engineering profession to ensure that only qualified and competent hands are engaged. “It is important that the necessary partnership with the government and other relevant organisations must be formed by the institute to checkmate the activities of quacks. Emphasis must be laid on professional development which the institute is highly committed. With the right leadership the challenges facing the institution will be reduced to the barest minimum,” he said.
