The milestone keep coming for Payseen. Cassa Gang/Kush Empire Entertainment has announced that the singer–songwriter’s new album have been streamed more than 40 thousand plus times globally. It’s another big win for the Nigerian born South African based singer in what is already a huge year. Currently, the singer is gearing up for the release of his follow up music videos. That’s not all, though. Till date, Vibe Machine is the singer’s finest work and it’s said to be is triumphant release. But the cassa gang/kush empire singer is not stopping. In 2020 alone, he released several singles: his good boy-styled solo cut, “Holiday,” he also shared “Take Over.” This were some of the singers’ best efforts in 2020.
