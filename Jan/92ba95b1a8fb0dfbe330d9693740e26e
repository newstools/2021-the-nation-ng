 If APC’s interim national leadership hoped to douse the crisis rocking the Kwara State chapter with the removal of Hon. Bashir Bolarinwa as the chairman, then it obviously got its permutations wrong. Reports reaching Sentry from Ilorin, indicate that fresh troubles are brewing within the party. In fact, the purported sack of the chairman is creating problems anew. While party leaders in Abuja are quick to tell you that the issues in Kwara are being resolved by the North-Central zonal leadership led by Governor Sani Bello of Niger State, inside sources say no fresh effort has been made to end the crisis. “The plan is to force the APC in Kwara to accept Abdullai Samari, the governor’s choice as the new chairman of the party and forget about Bolarinwa. The governor is enjoying the support of the national caretaker committee. But I can tell you for free that the plot will fail. The Niger State governor and his colleagues in the zonal leadership are just buying time and trying to convince those they can reach to support the governor’s choice,” a source said. But it appears Bolarinwa’s camp are not about to let go easily as members of the state executive caretaker committee continue to reject his removal. They have reportedly told Samari he cannot lead the APC in Kwara. On the other hand, the governor is telling whoever cares to listen that Samari remains the only APC chairman known to him, setting the stage for a prolonged crisis. These rumblings are coming when APC is about to register new members and revalidate the membership of old ones. The grapevine says the exercise may expose how bad the O’toge revolution has turned.
