Two suspected armed robbers who killed a motorist and made away with his car in Kano State have been arrested by police detectives. Police confirmed the death of the vehicle owner, Isa Hassan Abubakar, 50, allegedly shot by the armed robbers. The incident occurred on Saturday about 10pm near a shopping mall along Zoo Road. Witnesses said the suspects scared residents when they shot sporadically in the air. “People, scared, began to flee the area before they descended on one old man in his white Toyota Vibe car,” a witness told The Nation. Another source said, as people ran helter-skelter for their lives, he saw the gunmen approach a man in his car, forcefully removed him and fired a shot at him. “He fell and the attackers zoomed off in his vehicle.” Police Commissioner Habu Sani, speaking through  spokesman  Abdullahi Haruna, said the stolen vehicle has been recovered. Haruna said policemen swiftly visited the scene upon hearing gunshots. “Police arrived at the scene and chased the gunmen, who eventually abandoned the snatched vehicle and ran away. “The victim was rushed to the hospital but he died while receiving treatment,” he said. Haruna, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), said the suspects will be charged for armed robbery and homicide.
