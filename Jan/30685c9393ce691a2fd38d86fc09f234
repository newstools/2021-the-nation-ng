 THE leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Imo State chapter, has suspended  13 members of the organization indefinitely for allegedly  violating some sections of its constitution. The organization which dismissed as false and misleading, recent media report of purported impeachment and vote of no confidence against its president, Dr. Ezechi Chukwu, said that a disciplinary committee would soon be set up to investigate the erring members. Ambassador Kenneth Nwachukwu-state secretary of the organization who disclosed this while briefing newsmen in Owerri explained that only five, out of the 12 people who endorsed the purported “vote of no confidence petition” are authentic members of the executive committee of the body; stressing that the remaining 46 Exco members are solidly and firmly behind Chukwu’s leadership. According to him, the innuendoes and insinuations of those disseminating the rumours of impeachment of Chukwu were merely opposed to the choice of a very renowned and highly respected son of the state- Professor George Obiozor, adding that Ohanaeze Ndigbo in the state is holistically supportive of the candidacy of Ambassador Obiozor in conformity with the resolution of the elders and leaders of the state. “This is an Imo Ohanaeze solemn resolution and it has nothing to do with Dr. Ezechi Chukwu as a person and our support for Obiozor is based on merit and the added value his leadership portends compared with other equally qualified sons of ours who showed interest.” Quoting relevant portions of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo constitution to back up his assertion, Nwachukwu also dismissed as spurious, allegations making the rounds that Ezechi Chukwu had concluded plans to engage non-registered members of the body as delegates to the forth coming election, contending that this is at variance with the provisions of the organization
