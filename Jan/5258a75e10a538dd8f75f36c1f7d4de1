 SUPPORTERS of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Aba North Local Government Area of Abia State at the weekend defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). They were received by the Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, at his Camp Neya country home in Igbere, Bende Local Government Area. Kalu urged them to be of good behaviour and work conscientiously for the party’s victory in 2023. He said: “We are a disciplined party. We encourage people to pay workers’ salaries, pensions, build roads and take care of the society. We have no other business than taking care of our people. “We believe this party will make all of us proud. The party believes in the rule of law. It believes things should be done well, and believes in all Nigerians. “Your defection to the APC shows that this party is the best for Abia and Nigeria. We are growing stronger and stronger every day, and our growth will be felt in the 2023 elections.” Bunch Adiele and Eze Agege, who spoke for the defectors, pledged to be law abiding and deliver Aba to APC in 2023. They appealed to Kalu and the party’s leadership to accept them unconditionally. They said: “We are your sons and daughters residing and doing business in Aba. We have realised our mistake and lost our political root. But, today, we are here to tell you we are sorry and fully back with you. Forgive us and take us back as your children. “Today, we want to be officially accepted into APC to reunite with the father of politics in Abia. All the wards in Aba North are represented here. We are resolute to return Aba North to APC.”
