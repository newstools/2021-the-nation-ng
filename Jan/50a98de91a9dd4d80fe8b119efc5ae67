Given the recent surge in criminal activities across the country and the rise in kidnappings and banditry, Youth Party has released a policy document detailing how Nigeria can reform its police to meet up with the demands of securing every Nigerian. A statement signed by the party’s Acting Chair, Mr Tomiwa Aladekomo, linked the country’s rising insecurity to weak and ineffective policing. Mr Aladekomo said “we cannot expect to have a solid internal security architecture when the police who are primarily responsible for providing internal security are demotivated, poorly trained, poorly remunerated. And except we reform the police, we will continue to suffer insecurity.” Speaking about the policy paper on policy reform presented by the party, Mr Aladekomo noted that “opposition does not start and end with contesting elections, it is also about offering alternative, and often times superior, ideas on governance. “That is what we have just done by publishing this policy document that answers so many of the lingering questions on the lips of many Nigerians as to how we can have a competent and effective police force.” The party recommended a technology and intelligence driven police force, the establishment of community policing, the digitization of police records, and an improvement in the welfare of officers among several others.
