 ARUNA Quadri’s  TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell  started the New Year on a winning note and ended their losing streak in Germany’s Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL) on Sunday. Fulda-Maberzell beat Post SV Mühlhausen 3-0 with 20-year-old German international Fan Bo Meng playing a major role with a surprise win against his experienced compatriot Steffen Mengel. Another German international Ruwen Filus beat Lubomir Jancarik 3-0 (11- 9, 11- 3, 11- 7) while Meng edged Mengel 3-2 (17-15, 3-11, 6-11, 11- 9, 11- 6) to increase TTC lead to 2-0. Aruna then defeated experienced Austrian Daniel Habesohn 3-1 (6-11, 11-7, 11-5, 11-6) to wrap up victory for the Fulda based side. A delighted Aruna told NationSport yesterday that it was a perfect start for the team adding that the team is primed to do well in the second half of the season. “We are happy for the win although we did not expect that we would win easily 3-0. However, this is a good start into the second half of the season,” Aruna said. Vice President of TTC Claus-Dieter Schad described Meng’s win as crucial to the victory. “He (Meng) showed a great fighter heart and a lot of dynamism and power,” Schad said “He pulled it off in the last set and deservedly won. “This is a perfect start to the New Year and probably our best performance of the season.”
