 THE Oniru of Iruland, Oba Wasiu Omogbolahan Lawal, has inaugurated ‘Oba and Chiefs-in-Council’ to ensure the smooth running of his administration and see to the affairs of the people. The inauguration was held at the palace on Victoria Island, Lagos on Monday. The council consists of nine committees, which include Government Liaison, Market and Commerce, Infrastructure and Development, Environment, Security, Welfare, Tradition and Custom, Chieftaincy and Health. Spokesman for the council, the Arobadade of Iruland, Chief Abayomi Daramola, said the council was borne out of the need for a body to work with the monarch to see to the different aspects of community and ensure the needs of the community are met. According to him, each committee comprises white cap chiefs, Baales and one representative from each ruling house. Daramola said: “They have to co-operate with some of the members of the family that are not part of this body to work with them. All is to see to the good running, environmental issues, health issues, welfare issues and other issues that can come up that we can attend to in order to keep the community safe and going. “They have to see to the general environment, infrastructural development and other things that can bring development to the society.”
