If you’re wondering what the biggest company giveaway in Nigeria is this season, we’ve got you – and there’s still time to participate.  PalmPay is rewarding thousands of Nigerians who transact on its payments app by the 18th of January with a share of a 50 Million Naira prize pool. The PalmPay New Year Festival promo is designed to encourage and reward transactions such as bank transfers, airtime recharge and bill payments carried out on the platform. Any Nigerian adult can qualify for a share of the 50 Million Naira prize by making payments using PalmPay’s mobile app, which is available for download on the Google Play Store and iOS App Store. As part of the promotion, every completed transaction will give users a chance of winning either a discount coupon valued up to N50 or a “Festival Badge”. All customers who collect at least one of each of the 5 badge designs by the January 18th deadline will automatically qualify for a share of the prize pool and take home between N400-N6000 each. Interestingly, users of the PalmPay app also benefit from free bank transfers, zero fees on e-wallet deposits or bill payments, and receive discounts and cashback on all airtime, bills and data purchases. According to the CMO of PalmPay, Sofia Zab, “The PalmPay New Year Festival is our biggest giveaway yet. We are known as ‘The Payment App That Rewards You’ and we are living up to our tagline with every transaction made. We have hundreds of thousands of customers that use the PalmPay app every day because of the value it brings to them and we look forward to welcoming more Nigerians to the PalmPay family through this promotion.”  In December, the company ran a similar campaign called the PalmPay Carnival, where over 17,000 customers won a share of 20 million Naira. The platform is known for regularly hosting special promotions on top of its regular incentives to engage its user base. PalmPay entered the Nigerian market in September 2019 and has grown rapidly to reach a customer base of over 2 million transacting users. Over the last 6 months, the Mobile Money Operator has experienced a tenfold increase in daily transaction volume, fuelled by the accelerating trend towards digital payments brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. The PalmPay app enjoys rave reviews on the Google Play Store, where it has a market-leading 4.4* rating. “PalmPay is a must have for every Nigerian. It helps you save a lot on airtime with various discounts and bonuses. You can even purchase some items from there at a discounted price.  God bless you PalmPay. Keep growing!”, writes 5* reviewer Victor Femi Adebayo. 2021 will see the digital and financial services platform pursue further growth of its customer base, with plans to launch several innovations into the Nigerian market. Recent initiatives include a new “Group Discounts” feature which unlocks savings of up to 30% on airtime and data for users who complete a purchase together with friends, and the launch of the sale of physical products such as electronics and cosmetics with free door to door delivery within Lagos state. The PalmPay New Year Festival couldn’t have come at a better time for Nigerians looking for a financial windfall after celebrating the festive season. With just under a week to go until the promo ends, the countdown to transact and win is on!
