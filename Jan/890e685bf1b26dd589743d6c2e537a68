Ogun chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked Governor Seyi Makinde to first redeem the crisis-ridden Oyo PDP before dabbling into unnecessarily into offshore political counselling. Ogun PDP accused Makinde of seeking to import unnecessary crisis into its rank. Governor Makinde on Wednesday visited the Sagamu country home of former Governor Gbenga Daniel with some delegates in a southwest zone where he asked him to take over the structure of Ogun PDP for peace to reign. But Ogun PDP chairman, Dr. Sikirulahi Ogundele, on Thursday said Makinde ‘s visit to Daniel in the company of former Osun Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola, was an exercise in futility. Ogundele, in a statement, condemned the visit by Makinde and the Oyinlola- led factional southwest zonal reconciliation committee, saying it is unnecessary. According to him, members of Ogun PDP have started the process of reconciling their differences and ready to work towards success in 2023. Ogundele said the Governor should be more concerned about reconciling his differences with leaders of PDP in Oyo and stop meddling in the internal affairs of Ogun PDP. “Our committed leaders in the state and our committed leaders in the state and reconciliation committee are working relentlessly to resolve differences among our members, to ensure a United and strong platform that will take over governance in the state in 2023,” he assured. Ogundele, who doubles as chairman of the South West PDP Chairmen Forum, asked members not to be bothered about the visit of Makinde to Daniel.
