Despite its 2020 electoral misfortunes, the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, has insisted the All Progressives Congress (APC) is still strong in Bayelsa State. He spoke shortly after revalidating his membership at the on-going nationwide membership registration, update and revalidation exercise at New Camp Unit, Ward 4 (Agadama), Brass LGA, Bayelsa State. The former Bayelsa Governor urged all the APC members in the state and those yet to join to take advantage of the ongoing exercise in the ruling party to get registered. “APC is a strong party in Bayelsa. The love for our party is growing every day, so opportunity has presented itself for those that are yet to join us to take the advantage of this exercise and join the fold. “As we all know politics is about number, our great party APC is doing everything possible to encourage internal democracy where all members’ voices will be heard. We commend the party for giving Nigerians this opportunity,” he said. The Minister was accompanied by some party faithful to carry out revalidation of his membership. Chairman of Bayelsa registration committee, Aminu Abba Tukur, later presented the new membership card slip with number BY/BRS/01/00001 to the Minister after filling all the necessary details.
