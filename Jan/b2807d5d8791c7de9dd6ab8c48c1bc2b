Eleven persons have been kidnapped from an orphanage in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), with the police pledging to rescue them and bring their abductors to justice. The abductees, all orphans at Rachael’s Orphanage Home in Naharati, Abaji Area Council, were kidnapped on Saturday. The gunmen, who came in large numbers, also robbed facility’s security guard and his two wives. A resident said the hoodlums were armed with sophisticated weapons. They reportedly forced the gate open and went into the rooms of the orphans, and took 11 of them away at gunpoint. Police spokesperson Yusuf Mariam said, “We have launched strategic operations to rescue them and arrest the perpetrators.”
