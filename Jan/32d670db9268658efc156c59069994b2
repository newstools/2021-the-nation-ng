Notore Chemical Industries Plc has recorded an operating profit of N9.48 billion as against the N3.418 billion made in the preceding year. The company reported this in its audited financial statement for 2020 for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2020. Its Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. Onajite Okoloko, said the increase in the company’s operating profit is due to surpluses from the professional revaluation of investment properties class of its asset. “We recorded an Operating Profit of N9.48 billion for the 12-month period ended 30th September 2020 (30 September 2019: N3.42 billion), an increase of 177 per cent. The increase was mainly attributable to surpluses from the professional revaluation of investment properties class of its asset,” he said. He added that the company is diversifying its revenue stream through the optimisation of its assets, noting: “By leveraging its Oil and Gas Free Zone Developer Licensee status, the company took certain key steps during the year in furtherance of its plan to develop its 560-hectare industrial complex into a gas hub, as part of a gas monetisation programme and the promotion of an integrated logistics service provider to companies operating in West Africa, along the oil and gas value chain leading to further diversification of the company’s revenue stream. Noting that the company was well-positioned to lead the fertiliser market in Africa, he stressed that the domestic fertiliser market was yet to be maximised, even as the company fortifies its distribution system to dominate the African market. “Notore’s products are well positioned for effective shipment and distribution across the Atlantic coast, and Notore has positioned itself as the major distributor of fertiliser in Africa.
