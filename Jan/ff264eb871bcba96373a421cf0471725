Osun State Government has pleaded with the residents to ensure they adhere to safety protocols, to curtail the spread of COVID-19. It vowed to intensify efforts on the advocacy for taking precautions against COVID-19 pandemic. A statement on Sunday by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement,  Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, made it known that the government has launched a sensitisation programme across major markets on the need to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. He said: “We have visited Ota-Efun in Osogbo, Sekona in Ede, Ifon in Ifon-Orolu, Thursday Market in Ikirun, Owode-Ede market and a host of others. The influx of people in market areas made it necessary to sensitise the citizens on the need to obey COVID-19 safety protocols. “This is why we have taken the campaign to the market so that we can reawaken the consciousness of our people about this pandemic, which is still very much around, and we must take precaution against it. “In the last one week, Osun as a state has lost some of its industrious sons and daughters to the cold hands of this pandemic. That is a signal for us that we must prepare and make sure that we continue to sensitise our people.” He added that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has good plans for the people of Osun. “I call on citizens and residents of the state to support the governor’s good plans for the state.”
