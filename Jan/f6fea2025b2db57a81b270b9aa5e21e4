 FOR electricity consumers across the country, these are certainly not the best of times. Battered by the ravages of COVID-19, which had destroyed lives and livelihoods, they have to pay about 50 per cent increase in tariff through their noses for electricity not supplied. A retired civil servant in Abesan Estate, Lagos, expressed shock at the electricity bill that was slammed on him last November. The octogenarian who identified himself as Pa Isiaka, said he receives N5000 monthly as pension but now had to pay N27,000 monthly bill for his two-bedroom apartment in the estate. He said: “I am an 85-year-old retiree. I get only N5000 monthly as my pension. I pay my bill regularly because it was N5000. My children used to help me, but unfortunately, the one that had the strength was affected by job loss occasioned by COVID-19. I was owing only N500 as at October 2020. Now they brought N27,000 for November. Because of my condition, I paid N3000 out of the bill. Now they brought another N27,700 for December 2020. Where do they expect me to get this kind of crazy bill?” Two of the bills sited by our correspondent read: “Your Bill for DECEMBER 2020:  Tarrif: C – Non MD; Rate: 37.95; Read Code: D; LAR: PAR: Consumption: 679; Curr. Charges: N 27,700.65; Previous Balance: N28,500.68; Payment: N 3,000.00; Adjustment: 0.00; Amt Due: N 53,201.33; Due Date: 18/01/2021; For enquires, call 017000250; Detail: eservices.ikejaelectric.com/billing.

The owner of the second bill who identified herself as Mama Chibike, said before the recent hike, she had been battling the menace of crazy bill. “I don’t run a factory in my house. I am a retired civil servant being supported by my children. I don’t know why they were sending between N20,000 and N30,000 bill to me monthly. I went to complain to them, but they just kept promising that they will do something. Nothing was done until the recent hike,” she lamented. Another customer, Lizzy Chioma, said the officials of Ikeja Electricity (IE) stopped coming to read the analogue meters installed at her apartment. She alleged that each time the field workers of the power firm came around with their ladder threatening to disconnect, residents would start running helter-skelter to avert being disconnected. She said: “I challenged one of them why the electricity tariff was suddenly hiked from N5000 to N27,000, the young man said he was helpless and expressed sympathy with the consumers. He told me the order came from their boss in the office. He advised me to pay N45,000 to get pre-paid meter. I thanked him.” These are few of what the average electricity consumer in the country passes through. Electricity tariff and fuel price have been increased. While the Federal Government has legislated a minimum wage of N30,000, it is not clear if five, out of the 36 states, have started paying. The era of crazy billing under the guise of estimated billing has been replaced by an uncompassionate billing system backed by state actors. Pa Isiaka and Mama Chibike represent the poor the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) Chairman, Prof. James Momoh, assured that the tariff hike would not affect. Momoh said a strategy had been put in place to ensure that whatever happened, the poor would no longer subsidise the rich. Hear him:  “It is not going to affect the poor; we will make sure that the downtrodden and the people you feel for at the moment will not be affected by any increase we will be bringing forth. “It will be based on the hours of service and the quality of power available there. We don’t want the poor to subsidise the payment of the rich. In other words, we must make sure that the poor are not sacrificed in the process of tariff increase.”  Woried by mass outrage over estimated billings, NERC made an order capping  estimated billing in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI), which took effect from February 20, 2020. By Order No/NERC/197/2020, dated February 20, 2020 (the ‘Order’), NERC repealed the NERC (Methodology for Estimated Billing) Regulations 2012 (the ‘2012 Regulation’), and made an order capping estimated bill to unmetered customers by DisCos in NESI. The main objective of the Order is to protect unmetered R2 (Residential-single and three-phase meters, who consume more than 50kWh per month) and C1(Commercial-single and three-phase meters, small businesses) customers from arbitrary billing and expedite their metering process. The Order, among other things, stated that DisCos are to ensure tariff class A1 customers (customers using grid-connected premises for agriculture, schools, water boards, religious houses, government and teaching hospitals, etc, that require single or three-phase meters) are properly identified and metered by April 30, 2020; All unmetered R2 and C1 customers shall not be invoiced for consumption of energy beyond the price capped in schedule 1 of the Order, (by illustration, N1, 872 for R2, where consumption is capped at 78kWhr per month at a tariff of N24/kWh); All residential customers who consume not more than 50kWhr (R1 Customers) per month shall be billed N4/kWh at a total maximum of N200 per month; All other customers on higher tariffs shall be metered by April 30, 2020 otherwise they shall remain connected to supply but without further payment to the DisCos until a meter is installed. It was also directed in the Order any customer whose estimated bill is below the capped price shall remain so without upward review until the installation of a meter; and any customer who rejects the installation of a meter must be disconnected by the DisCo. The purport of the Order as stated in its objective and as succinctly captured above is quite apposite in the pursuit of customer satisfaction, however, there is need to point out that the energy cap on estimated bills for R2 and C1 customers is on a case by case basis and not a uniform base tariff of N1,800 popularly held. Schedule 1 of the Order makes clear provisions for Area/Business unit-specific billings per kWh for R1 and C1 customers. For example, in Abuja, whereas Kubwa is billed 114kWh for R2 and 120kWh for C1, Maitama is billed 432kWh for R2 and 548kWh for C1. In Lagos, whereas Apapa is billed 376kWh for R2T and 300kWh for C1S, Island is billed 774kWh for R2T and 648kWh for C1T. Whereas, Jigawa North is billed 61kWh for R2A and 60kWh for C1A, Kano Central is billed 83kWh for R2A and 86kWh for C1A.  The DisCos, however, screamed blue murder to the capping initiative, saying it was causing them huge monthly revenue loss. Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) said it lost more than N1.8 billion to capping of estimated billing, describing it as a disservice to the energy industry. The power firm’s chief, Mr John Ayodele, said: “As a result of capping, IBEDC is losing more than N1.8 billion every month for the energy delivered because those on capping do tell us that they don’t need meters because the capping is cheaper for them. “With this, they can use electricity as much as they want. It is not in our interests to do capping, based on what has been delivered to them,” he said.  The Federal Government had unveiled a National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP),  designed to bridge the metering gap estimated at about five million. Last November, under the first phase of the NMMP, one million meters were given to electricity consumers free in Kaduna and Kano, Lagos states with the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disbursed N14.35 billion to DisCos to cover the procurement of 263,860 meters under the  NMMP. Reacting, the spokesman for IE, Felix Ofolue, said the customers were being billed according to their bands. He said there was an increase in tariff in November, last year for customers in bands A, B and C in line with Service Reflective Tariff (SRT) approved by NERC. NERC had okayed tariff hike but said the DisCos must consult with customers first. “Following consultations and directions on tariff policy, the Commission (NERC) hereby approves a deferment of the applicable tariffs for customers in service bands D and E (that is customers with a service commitment of less than an average of 12 hours of supply per day over one month) for  September 1, 2020 to January 1, 2021,” it had said. Momoh  said under  Service Based Tariff (SBT) model, DisCos were expected to consult with the customers before any arbitrary hike. “Under these service-based principles, DisCos will only be able to review tariff rates for customers when they consult with customers, commit to increasing the number of hours of supply per day and quality of service.” According to a public notice entitled: Implementation of Revised Service Reflective Tariff by Ikeja Electric, the power firm said the hike in tariff was sequel to a consultative meeting among the Federal Government, labour unions and other stakeholders following concerns raised about the basis of the MYTO 2020 SRT, which were earlier planned to be implemented from September 1, 2020. On why the firm stopped reading meters, Ofolue said: “The integrity of most of the old meters have been compromised, so they don’t capture the actual consumption. The extortion claim is an allegation so we need proof to be able to investigate appropriately. We have always had a whistle-blowing channel where customers can report ilegalities. “Yes, prepaid meters are a means to capturing the actual consumption, so we always advise customers to apply for meters. However, we have commenced the National Mass Metering programme, so installation is free. Roll out is based on our scheduled plan.” The tariff hike has been described as ill-timed by stakeholders. They say it will not alleviate poverty but further aggravate it. They may be right. According to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), unemployment rate in the country jumped to 27.1 per cent in Q2 2020 from 23.1per cent in Q3 2018. Highlights of the statistics showed that the number of persons in the economically active or working age population (15 – 64 years of age) during the reference period of the survey, Q2, 2020 was 116,871,186. This is 1.2 per cent higher than the figure recorded in Q3, 2018, which was 115,492,969. The unemployment rate among young people (15-34 years) was 34.9per cent, up from 29.7per cent, while the rate of underemployment for the same age group rose to 28.2per cent from 25.7per cent in Q3, 2018. These rates were the highest when compared to other age groupings. The damage the hike in electricity tariff could cause for the people is captured in a World Bank report.  “Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by COVID-19, particularly due to the pronounced decline in oil prices and spikes in risk aversion in global capital markets. Nationally, 40 per cent of Nigerians (83 million people) live below the poverty line, while another 25 per cent (53 million) are vulnerable. With COVID-19, many of these 53 million vulnerable people could fall into poverty. The magnitude of the health impact depends on the duration and the domestic spread of the outbreak, while the economic impact hinges on oil prices. Oil accounts for over 80 percent of exports, a third of banking sector credit, and half of government revenue. Oil prices also affect growth in non-oil industries and services, with additional pressures arising from foreign portfolio investors’reassessment of risks and domestic liquidity management,” the global lender said. The Director-General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Muda Yusuf, said for investments to thrive in the power sector, cost-reflective tariff was inevitable. He said the alternative was for government subsidy. “Cost reflective tariff is a difficult option, especially given the prevailing economic conditions. But it is the most sustainable option that would salvage the power sector and attract investment. It is important to fix the numerous inefficiencies that characterise the entire power sector value chain,” he said. Analysts say fixing the numerous inefficiencies that have become the hallmark of the power sector post-privatisation should have come before overkilling tariff hike. “It’s like putting the cart before the horse. Increase in power generation and attainment of relative stability in power supply should have come before a hike in tariff. To me, it’s just adding to the burdens of the ordinary man like me,” Bankole Joseph, a barber said.
