 Yinka Ayefele’s Fresh FM has been listed as one of the top radio stations with the highest listeners in Southeast Nigeria. This was made known in a recent report by the South-West Media Gauge, an advanced audience measurement agency that distinguishes itself with a unique and extensive method of survey, in 2020 South-west Media Gauge teamed up with Canwest media and the Nigeria Broadcasters Merit Award to conduct the maiden edition of the South West Media Survey 2020 in South-Western Nigeria; Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, and Kwara. Based on the survey conducted, Adaba FM of Akure, Ondo State, is the most consistently listened to radio station in South-west Nigeria with wide coverage and strong listenership base in Ondo, Osun and Ekiti State followed by Fresh FM with stations in Ado Ekiti, Ibadan and Abeokuta, and Uniq FM of Ilesha, Osun State with a good listenership base in Osun State and Parts of Ekiti, Ondo and Oyo State. According to the Project Coordinator Eniola Akinpitan, “The growth of traditional media in the southwest and the unavailability of credible information bordering on the acceptability of the stations and quality of content, triggered the birth of the Audience measurement agency South West Media Gauge. SMG is strongly focused on creating an audience-friendly survey that will to a large extent, assist the fast-growing traditional media industry in identifying the true reflection of their content and feedback from their esteemed audience. To make this process viable a lot easier, we had to engage the very popular and indigenous advertising agency in the Southwest; Canwest Media, to assist in carrying out the Maiden edition of the annual South West Media Survey.” The survey, according to Akinpitan, adopted face-to-face interview methods with respondents across the locations which included professionals, and was reviewed by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) South-west zone.
