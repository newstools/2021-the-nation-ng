Residents and indigenes of Uratta Community in Aba North Local Government Area of Abia are living in fear following the death of a Police Sergeant killed by yet-to-be-identified hoodlums. Our correspondent gathered the late police sergeant identified as Okezie was unlucky not to have escaped the attack on his police station. It was not yet clear if the hoodlums carted away his riffle during the attack. A van belonging to the station, which was given to them by the Police Command from the fleet of cars donated to the Command of the Nigeria Police by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu was equally burnt. The charred vehicle is said to be abandoned at the Uratta junction of the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway. Some of the residents, who spoke to our correspondent, disclosed they have been living in fear while others have hurriedly left the area, citing the recent Orlu, Imo State. According to the residents, the incident happened on Monday night. The Abia State Command Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Geoffrey Ogbonna, couldn’t answer his calls. He stated in an SMS he can’t take calls at the time of filing the report.
