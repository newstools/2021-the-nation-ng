Mr. Gbenga Ibikunle, who was kidnapped alongside his wife at Uso village along the Akure-Owo highway has said that his wife lied she was pregnant to avoid her being raped by her abductors. Ibikunle, his wife and three children were returning from Ebonyi when the kidnappers struck. The kidnappers took the couple and locked the children inside the car. Ibikunle who spoke to journalists in Akure said they were released after three days in captivity. He dismissed claims by the police that they were rescued stating that they paid N2m as ransom. He said, “I am surprised with the claims that we were rescued by the police. This is nothing but a lie coming from the pit of hell. “I can say it boldly that no security agency came to our rescue. We were released around 1 am after ransom was paid to them. “They collected the ransom along the road without being jittery. Infact, they counted all the money before they released me to my brother, who brought the N2 million.” Continuing, he said, “We were in the bush with them for three good days without food. They treated us like criminals. They beat us with stick and cutlass. We met a man in their den, who was also released the same way we were. His own family parted with N10 million before he was released. “At a point they wanted to rape my wife, but she tricked them that she was pregnant. “We don’t have security in this country anymore. It is sad that our security agencies are not effective. The kidnappers carried out their operations with impunity. They boasted that they will kill any policeman that wanted to rescue us. “I am weeping for this country because we are not safe. We can no longer travel.”
