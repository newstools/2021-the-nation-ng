The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has gone to court to challenge President Muhammadu Buhari’s recent extension of the tenure of Police Inspector-General Mohammed Adamu. The suit was filed at the Federal High Court, Lagos, on Thursday. Other respondents in the suit are the Police Service Commission (PSC) and IGP Adamu. Adamu should have proceeded on retirement on February 1, the day he clocked 35 years in service. However, his tenure was extended by three months by the President. The NBA’s contention is that the IGP ceased to be a member of the Nigeria Police Force when he attained 35 years in service on February 1, 2021. It claims the President’s purported extension of IGP Adamu’s tenure by three months contravenes the provisions of Section 215 (1)(a) of the Constitution and is, therefore, unlawful. It says, in a supporting affidavit, that Adamu, as the former Inspector General of Police, completed his 35 years of service as a police officer on February 1, 2021 but was purportedly extended by the first defendant It adds that on September 16, 2020, the President assented to the Nigeria Police (Establishment) Bill (now Act), which repealed the previous Police Act and fixed retirement age of all police officers at 35 years of service or 60 years of age, whichever comes first. It added that as at February 1, 2021, Adamu had served the Nigeria Police Force for a period of 35 years. The NBA is therefore praying the court for the following reliefs: The defendants have yet to file their response to the suit.
