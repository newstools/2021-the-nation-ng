Akwa Ibom State High Court sitting in Uyo, the state capital, on Thursday granted N20 million bail to a United States-based critic, Zion Eno Umoh, who is facing trial for alleged terrorism. The court, presided over by Justice Archibong Archibong, admitted Umoh to the bail with two sureties in like sum. The sureties, the court held, must be residents within the jurisdiction of the court and must have evidence of landed property worth N20 million. Justice Archibong also listed other bail conditions for the defendant to include a letter of recognition and identification of the two sureties by prominent citizens residing within the jurisdiction of the court. The judge ordered that Umohâ€™s travel documents, including his international passports, be deposited with the Assistant Chief Registrar of the court who should also verify the particulars of the sureties. The documents, the judge ruled, should be confirmed by the State Prosecution Counsel before Umoh is released from prison custody. The judge also held that the defendant did not refute or counter the averment of the state respondent that he is a flight risk with no residential address within Akwa Ibom State or Nigeria, hence can fly out of the country any time without notice.
