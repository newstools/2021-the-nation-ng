Four suspected cultists have been arrested by police after reportedly causing mayhem at Osun State Polytechnic, Iree. The Nation gathered that the suspects were threatening students with some consequences if they failed to join their confraternity. It was said that some concerned students called the police on the suspects. On Friday evening, the anti-cultism unit of the police stormed the school and arrested the four suspects. Reacting to the arrest yesterday, police spokesperson Mrs Yemisi Opalola said they got information that some cultists named Akintade Wisdom, Sodiq Opeyemi, Olayinka Fadeyi and Azeez Olalekan were arrested by police and were transferred to the Criminal Investigation Department for further investigation. “From the interrogation of the four cultists, they are not students of the institution,” Opalola said.
