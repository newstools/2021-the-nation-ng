Many residents have fled their homes after a gun duel between hoodlums and police in Obowo Police Division in Imo State. Two operatives were killed while three were seriously injured in the clash. It was gathered that the bandits stormed the station in the early hours of Saturday to free their members reportedly held there. Some of the fleeing residents said the bandits were heavily armed. “At around 2am we started hearing gunshots but when some of us got to the scene, we saw two of the officers already dead while some were critically injured. We have not seen this kind of shooting before, they said . According to them, the bandits tried to gain access to the police armoury and also tried to release some detainees who we suspected are their members but were resisted by the police. They expressed the fear that the hoodlums may come back for another attack. Command’s spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu said the command lost two officials, and that investigation had begun.
