 Everton winger Alex Iwobi said he has no regret on his departure from Arsenal. Iwobi, who can also operate as a forward, came through the youth academy at Arsenal and played over 100 games in all competitions for the Gunners. Then in the summer of 2019, when Unai Emery was in charge of Arsenal, the North London club sold the Nigeria international to Premier League rivals Everton . The Everton attacker told Sky Sports: “It’s tough going from that at Arsenal. One manager, obviously Unai Emery came, and yeah it was a bit different because there was a lot of different methods, things were getting changed, positions, formations, and I have had to play in numerous positions, so maybe I was a bit unsettled, but I don’t really want to say like an argument or problem because at the end of the day, as footballers, we should be able to cope with the situation. “Maybe I should have handled it better, but whether what happened in the past has made me who I am today, so there’s no regret.” Iwobi is doing well at Everton at the moment. There have been injury problems, but overall, it has been a good time for him at Goodison Park. According to WhoScored, the 24-year-old has made 11 starts and eight substitute appearances in the Premier League for the Toffees so far this season, scoring one goal and providing two assists in the process. During the 2019-20 campaign, the Nigeria international made 19 starts and six substitute appearances in the league for Everton, scoring one goal in the process, according to WhoScored.
