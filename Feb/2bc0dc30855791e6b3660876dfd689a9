 Leicester City would be without Jamie Vardy and Wilfred Ndidi when they face Fulham tomorrow in the EPL. The key Leicester City pair both missed Sunday’s 3-1 defeat to Leeds, the club’s first loss in 10 matches , but neither will have overcome their injury problems in time to provide Brendan Rodgers with a boost ahead of the trip to the capital. Vardy is in the process of recovering from a hernia operation and could return to training later in the week. Ndidi, meanwhile, suffered a minor hamstring tear in the 1-1 draw at Everton and is not due to be back in action until next week. After the loss to Leeds, Rodgers said it was clear his side would have benefitted from their involvement. “I think everyone watching the game could see there were certain moments where those two players would have brought real quality for us,” Rodgers said. “The thing we missed with the two of them was the physicality. I thought our physical players were good but I felt we needed more. “But we have won games without them. I think it was more the case we didn’t defend as well as we would have liked and we didn’t take our opportunities.” He added: “They won’t be fit for Wednesday. I don’t have a game to say when they will be, but Jamie’s progressing really well. Hopefully he’ll have a good week this week and we’ll take it from there.”
