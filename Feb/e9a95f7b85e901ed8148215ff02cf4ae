The Medicaid Cancer Foundation (MCF) has called on the Federal Government, states and other critical stakeholders to ramp up institutionalised screening, testing and treatment of cancer patients across the country, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It noted that COVID-19 has led to interruptions, delays and even complete halt in prevention programmes, diagnostics and testing, clinical trials and research. It stated that there have been difficulties in maintaining life-saving services, not only due to a drop in resources but also because of the measures enacted to contain the spread of the Coronavirus and infection of patients with underlying disease like cancer. To commemorate this year’s World Cancer Day, the organisation, in a statement, said: “Medicaid Cancer Foundation calls for urgent actions on early stage cancer detection, institutionalized screening and   diagnosis to significantly improve cancer patients’ chances of survival. “The difficulties in engaging in community outreach with restrictions on travel and social gathering creates great obstacles in low- and middle-income countries.” “This year, as we struggle to comply with Covid-19 protocols, we are distributing the ‘OrangeBox’; in commemoration of World Cancer Day (WCD) to 20 cancer warriors across Nigeria. Eachbox contains essential warrior supplies and a grant of N200,000 ($550) funding for drugs and chemotherapy. “Despite these, our  successful  Patient  Access  to   Cancer Care  Evolution  (PACE)  programme received a boost with the inclusion of more drugs and consumables from drug companies within and outside Nigeria. These include Roche, Sanofi, Pfizer, Jansen and RemedyChainInc. In particular, we are pleased to announce on this WCD 2021, the inclusion of Perjeta (Pertuzumab) by Roche and Ibrance (palbociclib) by Pfizer; both used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.”
