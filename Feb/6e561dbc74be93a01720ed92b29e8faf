Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers confirms striker Jamie Vardy will be available for their trip to Wolves on Sunday even as he singled out Nigeria international Kelechi Iheanacho as a ‘terrific’ option. Iheanacho scored at Craven Cottage and Rodgers is happy to keep Vardy in reserve if needed. Rodgers has confirmed Jamie Vardy is fit to make a return to the squad as Leicester face Wolves on Sunday, but insists there is no need to rush the striker back. Vardy, who has scored 11 league goals so far this season, is fit for the trip to Molineux after a groin operation last month. In his absence, Leicester have tightened their grip on third spot in the Premier League having beaten Fulham 2-0 on Wednesday. “Jamie is so important to us but the beauty of it is we don’t need to rush him back,” Rodgers said. “Just to have him available to start or come off the bench is a huge boost for us. Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers says his side ‘will do their talking on the pitch’ as they remain within touching distance to the teams at the top of the Premier League “Jamie will be available for the game. It was just about trying to fit the operation in at the right time, we had a good idea of the recovery time but Jamie is naturally very fit and he has recovered very well. He looks fit, strong and available. “You saw Kelechi the other night, Kels was terrific, he scored a great goal and he will be high in confidence.
