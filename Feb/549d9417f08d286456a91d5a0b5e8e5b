Violent crimes increased in South Africa between Oct. 1 and Dec. 30, 2020, authorities said on Friday. South African Police Minister Bheki Cele made this known at a press conference held in Pretoria, while releasing the crime statistics for the third quarter of 2020 and 2021 financial year, which runs from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Cele said that during the three months, murder cases increased by 6.6 per cent with 2,481 people murdered in public spaces including the street, open fields, parking areas and abandoned buildings. He said this figure was 389 more compared to the corresponding period in the previous financial year. He said that there was a five per cent increase in sexual offences, or an increase of 181 cases, with 12,218 people raped between October and December 2020. According to him, aggravated robberies such as carjacking and others increased by 7 per cent. “The national crime statistics do not paint a good picture and hence force us as the police to dig deep and put the shoulder to the wheel. “Commissioner, there must be accountability. It can’t be business as usual. We must all have sleepless nights over these crime numbers,’’ said Cele. The crimes were committed when the country was on lockdown level one and three. Economists have warned that high crimes have a potential to scare potential investors. (Xinhua/NAN)
