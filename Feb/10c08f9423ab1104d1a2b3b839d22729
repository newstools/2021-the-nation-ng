 CHAIRMAN and Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Buba Marwa (rtd.) says the criminalities in the country will continue if the problem of drug abuse is not addressed. Marwa said the use of drugs in Nigeria today is at an alarming proportion of approximately 15 million, nearly three times the global prevalence. He said this during the inauguration of a Special Purpose Committee of the NDLEA to mobilise the civil society to get actively involved in the fight against drug abuse, peddling and trafficking in Abuja. “No wonder so much criminality everywhere in our land and it is increasing instead of abating with such symptoms as kidnapping, insurgency, banditry, rape, and assassinations. Behind it all is drug use. Criminals now ask for ransom in drugs and unless we get to this root cause, we will only be scratching the surface, as the criminalities will continue to flourish,” he said. The committee which was headed by him had the mandate to bring up recommendations on how best to tackle and eliminate the drug scourge within the shortest possible time. A former Director-General of NDLEA, Otunba Lanre Ipinmisho who serves as the Coordinator of the committee assured that the purpose of mobilising the professionals for the campaign against drugs will be achieved. Present at the event were the representatives of the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari; wife of the Vice President, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo and that of Edo State First Lady, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki, while the Benue State governor’s wife, Mrs. Eunice Ortom, attended personally.
