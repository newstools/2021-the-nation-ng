  In-form FC Lorient’s Nigerian striker Terem Moffi said he won’t be resting on his oars after securing his side’s priceless winner in a 3-2 win against the star-studded Paris Saint Germain last weekend. The 21 year-old came off the bench to stun the French champions in the 91st minute, making it his fifth goal in five Ligue 1 matches. Laurent Abergal’s opener in the 36th minute gave Lorient the lead before two Neymar penalties saw PSG taking the lead. Yoane Wissa equalized for Lorient in the 80th minute before Moffi struck with a volley to hand PSG their first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino. “ It is certainly a very important goal considering how big a club PSG are,” Terem, the son of former Enugu Rangers International goalkeeper, Barrister Leo Moffi, told NationSports. “ It is as important as the goal I scored in my second league match in Belgium against Club Brugge. “Both goals have similarities as I had to cover at least half the field solo before scoring. Besides, just like that Brugge goal announced me to the Belgium league, I see this PSG goal as announcing me to the bigger football world. “It was satisfying watching the goal later on CNN World Sports,” he noted. Moffi has scored five impressive goals in the French Ligue 1 in the current campaign making him one of the most inform Nigerian strikers in Europe. A former member of the national Under-17 national team, Terem said it would be a dream come through if his exploits with Lorient can be rewarded with call-up with Super Eagles; as he bids to join the likes of Samuel Chukwueze and Victor Osimhen who were his teammates at junior levels. He said: “ Playing for my country will be a dream come true. As for the call up, I have an open mind on the issue. The matter rests with the national team coaches. I am concentrating on getting better and better with my game. However , if coach Gernot Rohr calls me now, I’m ready to deliver.”
