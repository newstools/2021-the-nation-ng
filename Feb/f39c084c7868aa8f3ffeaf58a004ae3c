 Ondo State Government is planning staggered learning for pupils in secondary and primary schools to curb the spread of COVID-19. This is owing to the increased population of pupils in some of the schools in Akure, the state capital. Acting Commissioner for Health Jibayo Adeyeye said the planned staggered learning was aimed at avoiding clustering and crowding of pupils. Adeyeye, who spoke after a joint inspection of schools in Akure, said prevention of COVID-19 required special efforts, stressing the need for re-organisation of subjects’ timetable in schools, where pupils are highly-populated. He noted that highly-populated schools have problems maintaining social distance, even though pupils were observing other cautions. Adeyeye added that assemblies and any form of congregation have been cancelled in schools as well as reduction of break periods to run between five and ten minutes to protect the lives of students and teachers from the virus. Commissioner for Education Mr. Femi Agagu said measures were being worked out to restructure classes so that the number of pupils in class at a time would be minimal. He advised schools’ managements to make use of unutilised spaces in their domains for lectures.
