The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 has suspended 100 international passports for six months because their owners violated coronavirus protocols. They did not comply with the mandatory Day 7 post-arrival COVID-19 test. This is the second batch of 100 passports to be placed on travel restrictions. The PTF said over 20,000 passengers evaded the mandatory in-country test. It said it would continue to suspend their travel documents in batches if they fail to take the test. The PTF insists that only a negative PCR test will be acceptable for inbound travellers, which must be conducted within 96 hours before boarding.
