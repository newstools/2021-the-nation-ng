Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola on Wednesday in Osogbo inaugurated Justice Wasiu Akanbi as the president of the Customary Court of Appeal. He urged Akanbi to uphold the sanctity of the judiciary. The governor appealed to him to discharge his duties with the fear of God and topmost sincerity, and ensure fairness and equity in the dispensation of justice. Oyetola, who described judiciary as the last hope of the common man, advised Akanbi to use judicial instrumentality to sustain the pervading peace in the state and adjudicate justice to sustain the status of Osun as the most peaceful state. He reiterated his administration’s commitment to ensuring the independence of the judiciary and championing the welfare of judicial officers. According to him, the Customary Court of Appeal remains one of the custodians of the people’s custom and tradition and a formidable medium for protecting them. Oyetola said the new Customary Court of Appeal president must always dispense justice to those who might have suffered injustice at the lower court, in the interest of peace. The governor urged him to build a stronger justice system that would deliver a better and more dignified state. “The Customary Court of Appeal has a duty to ensure that the custom and tradition pertaining to marriages, property ownership, inheritance and other spheres that are critical to people’s lives, but which are usually unwritten and often subjected to abuse, are protected and sustained. “The court has a huge task, not only to ensure that the sanctity of people’s custom and tradition is maintained and sustained, but also to dispense justice to those who might have suffered injustice at the lower court and to promptly dispense same in the interest of peace,” he said. Akanbi expressed gratitude to the governor for finding him worthy of the appointment. He pledged to deliver his duties with high sense of diligence, integrity and competence.
