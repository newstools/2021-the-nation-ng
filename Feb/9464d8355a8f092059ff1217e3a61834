Personal Assistant to President Muhamamdu Buhari on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has stated most members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) won’t welcome former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode should he decides to return to the party. The Nation had exclusively hinted Fani-Kayode may be on his way back to the APC after meeting with the acting national chairman of the APC Governor Mai Buni of Yobe State and Kogi Governor Yahaya Bello at the weekend. Fani-Kayode had confirmed the meeting, stating it was to discuss national affairs and party issues. But Ahmad, in a tweet on Monday evening, said the former Minister may not be welcomed by the majority of APC members whom he attacked for several years. “If he decides to join the governing party, I don’t think he will be welcome by the majority of the party members whom he made it a duty to attack and insult for several years,” Ahmad said on his official Twitter handle.
