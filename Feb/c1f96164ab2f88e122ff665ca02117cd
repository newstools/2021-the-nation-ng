 Yoruba activist Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho, on Monday visited Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, on his mission to end herdsmen’s assault on farmers. Igboho, who was received with a loud ovation, insisted that all killer herdsmen must leave Yorubaland. The Nation had reported how military men escorted herdsmen to flog residents in a community in Ogun State. In a viral video where Igboho was addressing supporters in Abeokuta, he said: “Many of our families abroad cannot come home. They scared of being kidnapped. All expressways in the Southwest, especially Lagos, Ondo, have been taken over by killer herdsmen who are kidnapping and killing innocent people. That’s the reason why I’m here. ”It is time for the youth to stand up, and fight for our rights. That’s why I’m at the forefront of the struggle. Igangan people have confirmed to me that there is peace after my visitation. So, that is why I said I won’t be visiting Igangan alone, I will touch all Southwest states. I want to appreciate the Ogun state Governor for his support. Even the government is tired of the evil doings of these killer herdsmen. “Although I have not met physically with the governor, I went to see the places where herdsmen are disturbing them first. We are heading to Yewa because this is the place where many killer herdsmen have attacked residents. “I have not seen any Yoruba person who wants to sabotage my current agitation, because this is the fight for all Yoruba people. You can see the support from Christians and Muslims, not Igboho alone. Even all those in the diaspora, traditional rulers, and everyone have stood up against this problem.”
