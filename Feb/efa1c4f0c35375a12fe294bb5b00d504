 Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has inaugurated 2,000 COVID-19 marshals that will help in enforcing compliance of the virus’ safety protocols, particularly the use of a face mask. The COVID-19 marshals were formerly known as Kano Sanitation Vanguard, whose job was to inspect homes on sanitation days, it was learnt. The governor said the decision to have marshals was taken because despite the new wave of COVID-19, which is tougher than the first wave of the pandemic, residents are refusing to observe the infection, prevention and control (IPC) protocols. Dr. Tijjani Hussaini, who is the Coordinator, Kano COVID-19 Technical Response Team, said yesterday that 77 Coronavirus deaths were recorded in Kano as from April last year. Hussaini explained that the first wave was almost defeated in Kano, but the coming of the new variant, whose positivity is 13 cases out of 100 tests, calls for caution and adherence to safety measures. “The new wave is so deadly that it has increased the number of patients requiring oxygen,” he added. He said in all, about 64,000 samples have been tested, with 2,952 cases confirmed. Of the positive cases, 340 patients are currently on home-based care and hospital admissions, he said. Ganduje said: “COVID-19 is back, that is why we are back. We cannot sit and watch our people die of the virus. “In the first wave, we started with prevention, then curative and palliative measures. Now, we have to do more. Last time, we did lockdown that called for palliatives.
