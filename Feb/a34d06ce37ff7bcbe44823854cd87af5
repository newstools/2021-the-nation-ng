 The long absence of Victor Osimhen due to injury as well as COVID-19 related may have been linked for the call for sacking of coach Gennaro Gattuso at Napoli. Osimhen was a record signing for Napoli when he was signed from Lille of France and the Nigerian is yet to prove his worth under Gattuso which has affected the fortune of Napoli in the Serie A. However, the management of the team has reportedly decided to part ways with Gattuso in June, a decision which has now being faulted by former Italian striker Christian Vieri. “But what are they doing in Naples? “Vieri told ‘Bobo TV’ on the Twitch platform. “But what does this De Laurentiis do? “He called Benitez and it seems he has probed three or four others. But what man are you? Gattuso is good, I would have resigned in his place. You can’t work like this. “First he wanted him to sign the contract renewal and then after two weeks he called other coaches. If he didn’t win the other day what would happen? More insults? “ Vieri further highlighted the case of Gattuso as per non-availability of Osimhen: “ This year he never had Osimhen and Mertens. But what are we talking about? I have a goal? I feel insults and insults for him, these are out of their minds.” Meanwhile, , there strong indications that Gattuso is not ready to risk the Nigeria international forward. Osimhen was an unused substitute at the weekend and he has only played for 25minutes after coming from the bench in Napoli’s 1-3 loss to Spezia. Italian tabloid La Gazzetta dello Sport claimed Osimhen is not fully fit to be in the starting line-up while his display against Spezia has shown that he is not yet at his best. “The Nigerian striker is not yet ready to start as a starter. The Nigerian striker is not yet in the best of conditions and the coach does not want to risk it. So far he has played for a few minutes without ever convincing,” noted La Gazzetta dello Sport in an editorial published yesterday.
