Manchester United equalled the Premier League record by putting nine goals past nine-man Southampton – the second time Saints have lost 9-0 in as many seasons. A red card for Saints’ Alexandre Jankewitz after only two minutes triggered a complete collapse for the visitors, who were on the end of the same scoreline against Leicester City in October 2019. It is only the third time a team has lost 9-0 in the Premier League, with United also beating Ipswich Town by that margin in 1995. Aaron Wan-Bissaka opened the scoring with his first goal at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani also found the net either side of a Jan Bednarek own goal before the break. After a fairly drab start to the second half, United cut loose, scoring five times in the final 21 minutes.
