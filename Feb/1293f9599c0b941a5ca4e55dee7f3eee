The National Universities Commission (NUC) has approved the running of Forensic Science and 13 other environmental/engineering courses at the First Technical University (Tech-U), Ibadan. Based on the approval, the institution has become the first university to offer the course in Nigeria, coming after only the Nigerian Police Academy. The approval is contained in a letter from the NUC, dated February 10, 2021, conveying the nod of the Executive Secretary, Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, based on a recent verification exercise the commission conducted at the university. The NUC lists the 13 other newly approved courses as Computer Engineering, Civil Engineering, Industrial and Production Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Biochemistry, Science Laboratory Technology, and Quantity Surveying. Others are Survey and Geo-Informatics, Urban and Regional Planning, Architecture, Biotechnology, Estate Management and Building. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ayobami Salami, thanked the NUC for the confidence it has continued to have in Tech-U. He said: “We appreciate the confidence, with the promise that we will continue to provide solid education in an environment of best global practices. With the fresh approval, the third faculty (i.e. Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Management) is being consolidated, since we have already consolidated in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology as well  as the Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences.” Some of the courses earlier approved for Tech-U include Petroleum Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Agricultural Engineering, Mechatronic Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Cyber Security Science. Others are Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Software Engineering, Statistics, Microbiology, Industrial Chemistry and Food Science.
