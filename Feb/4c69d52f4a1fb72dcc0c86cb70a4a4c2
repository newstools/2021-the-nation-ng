 Moyo Lawal believes that anyone’s outfit shouldn’t define his or her character. The actress, in a recent social media post, wondered why people are being judged by what they wear – especially Africans. Moyo had posted a picture of herself on her Instagram page with a caption that expresses her opinion on outfits and character. “The way Africans judge characters based on appearances has always fascinated me,” she began. “What is the psychology that states that a woman comfortable in her own skin is promiscuous? Because here is the thing, when most people get surgery or add or lose weight, they start dressing in exactly that same way. Does that mean, they have suddenly become promiscuous as well? Never Forget, that appearances indeed can be very deceptive.”
