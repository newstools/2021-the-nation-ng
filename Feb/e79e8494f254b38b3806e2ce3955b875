The United Nations International Children’s Education Fund (UNICEF) Country representative to Nigeria, Peter Hawkins, on Thursday warned that Coronavirus would continue for the next two years. He said:  “We are only halfway through. The pandemic will continue for another one or two years.” Hawkins spoke in Akure , the Ondo State capital, when he met with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. He reiterated that 16 million doses of the Covax vaccine would arrive in Nigeria very soon. Hawkins explained that more doses of the vaccine would arrive over the next few months, which would ensure that the vaccine covered 20 per cent of the population of the country. “In the meantime, we are exploring how else to bring vaccines in with a view to  allowing Nigeria to go to 40 per cent by the end of the year. This should be possible things being equal”. “A lot has been done in ensuring that Nigeria secures the right level of vaccine and plans for the equitable distribution of vaccine are being taken through,” he said. Responding, Akeredolu thanked UNICEF for the support given to the state over the years. The governor, who lamented the delay in the purchase of vaccine for the Nigerian populace, described the situation as unfortunate. He also appealed for assistance for a permanent solution to end open defecation in the state.
