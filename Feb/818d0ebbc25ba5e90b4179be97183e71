For Chief Kemi Nelson, former Lagos State Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation and Executive Director, Operations of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), birthdays are special and highly valued. But for some reason, she now opts for low-key birthday celebrations. Last year, she marked her 64th birthday with a quiet ceremony at the Archbishop Vining Memorial Church, GRA, Ikeja, Lagos, with family, friends and political associates. A reception at her home followed and it was attended by dignitaries like the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, Lagos State Commissioner for Commerce, Trade & Industries, Lola Akande and her Local Government and Community Affairs counterpart, Dr. Wale Ahmed. Her 65th birthday on Tuesday, February 9, shared the same similarities with last year’s event. The day started with a session of praise, worship and thanksgiving at her home in Ikeja, Lagos. Top personalities who couldn’t make it to the celebration due to COVID-19 precaution joined via Zoom. These included Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his wife, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu: Deputy Governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, his wife, Oluremi and First Lady of Ogun State, Mrs. Bamidele Abiodun. Governor Sanwo-Olu described Nelson as a fashion icon, fighter for the oppressed, political pillar and worthy role model. Family, friends and associates also poured praises on the celebrant before she cut one of her many beautiful cakes.
