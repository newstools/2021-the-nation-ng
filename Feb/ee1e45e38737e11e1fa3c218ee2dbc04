The Magama/Rijau Federal Constituency bye-election in Niger State has been marred by violence as ballot box snatching and other forms of thuggery caused voters apathy. The election turned to a free for all violence in most of the polling centres the election held as ballot boxes were snatched while voters were still casting their votes. Thugs were having a field day as they moved from one polling units to another with guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons visibly threatening voters from voting for their candidates. A lot of voters had to return home in order to keep safe and avoid being caught in the violence which resulted to some people being injured. The Magama/Rijau federal constituency bye-election was being slugged out between three political parties African Democratic Party (ADC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has been disqualified from taking part in the action. The areas where the violence was more visible were Ibeto in Magama local government and parts of Rijau in Rijau local government area. The Resident Electoral Commissioner in Niger state, Professor Sam Egwu said he is aware of the violence and has called the attention of the police to that effect. According to Egwu, who is one of the three Commissioners monitoring the election, he called the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of operation to deploy policemen to Ibeto to restore peace, law and order. He described the behaviour of the youths as sad and unfortunate saying it was an affront to the improvement made in democracy in the past years. According to Egwu, “I have reported the situation to the police since. Security threat analysis on the part of the police gave indications of what is going on.”
