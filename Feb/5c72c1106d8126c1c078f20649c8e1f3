It was a case of upcoming star meets superstar when Victor Osimhen took the chance to pose for a photo and exchanged jerseys with the legendary Cristiano Ronaldo after Napoli pipped champions Juventus in a Serie A game. Osimhen was replaced in the 75th  minute of this encounter at Stadio Maradona, while Ronaldo played the entire game. It would be recalled that Osimhen also posed for photos with another of his idols, Odion Ighalo, when Manchester United took on Club Brugge in a UEFA Europa League tie in Belgium last year. Napoli beat Juve 1-0 at the Stadio Maradona thanks to a spot-kick converted by the Azzurri captain in the first half. Insigne dedicated the goal and the victory to his wife, both on the pitch and social media. Several Napoli players shared messages on Instagram and Twitter to celebrate their victory and even Kalidou Koulibaly, who is out of action due to COVID, sent a message to Napoli fans on Instagram. Juventus players, on the other hand, were quiet even as Alvaro Morata, Leonardo Bonucci and Cristiano Ronaldo posted messages on Instagram urging their teammates to look ahead to the next Champions League match against Porto. Saturday’s crucial win has lifted Napoli to fourth place on 40 points from 21 games, a point behind Juventus. AC Milan are top of the standings with 49 points.
