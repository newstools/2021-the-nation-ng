 Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has not foreclosed the possibility of ‘retired’ striker Odion Ighalo to return to the squad after he teamed up with Saudi Arabian side Al –Shabab. The 31-year-old Ighalo called it quit with international football after helping the Super Eagles to win bronze at the 2019 Africa Cup of nations in Egypt. Where he emerged the tournament’s top scorer. En route to Egypt 2019, Ighalo scored seven goals in the Africa Cup of Nations qualification campaign, the most by any player and found the net against Burundi in the group phase; Cameroon in the round of 16;Algeria in the semi-finals and Tunisia in the third-place playoff before announcing his retirement from the international scene. Snapped up by Al Shabab last week after his long loan spell at Manchester United, Rohr was coy when pressed about the chances of Ighalo joining the Super Eagles fray again. “Playing regularly in Saudi is not a reason to eliminate a good player from Super Eagles,” the 67-year-old experienced coach told NationSport. Meanwhile, Rohr has for the umpteenth time expressed happiness over the impressive lineup of Nigerian strikers making scoring waves with their European clubs, adding he was scouting on all fronts ahead naming a squad for the forthcoming 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho. “Terem Moffi (Lorient) is doing well like Taiwo Awoniyi (Union Berlin), Paul Onuachu (Genk), Umar Sadiq(UD Almeria), Henry Onyekuru (Galatasaray) again…and others,” explained Rohr who breezed into Abuja at the weekend.“We are looking in all directions! Cheers from Abuja.
