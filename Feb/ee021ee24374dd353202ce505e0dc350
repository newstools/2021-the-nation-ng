The calls for the International Criminal Court to probe the immediate past Service Chiefs is unpatriotic, the Federal Government has stated. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said this on Tuesday during a Radio Nigeria programme, Politics Nationwide. President Muhammadu Buhari announced new leadership for the nation’s military last Wednesday after the former occupants stayed for five years at the helm of affairs. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and some other Nigerians have called for the probe of the Olonisakin, Buratai, Ibas and Abubakar to unravel circumstances behind the security lapses during their tenure. But Mohammed said: “To the best of my knowledge, our Service Chiefs obey the rules of engagement and where there are infractions, there are internal regulations and internal mechanisms to address them. “Those who are calling for the ex-service chiefs to be invited to ICC are unpatriotic people.” He also said those calling for probe of the former military chiefs don’t have the competence to talk on military structure and formations whether in the north-east or in any other parts of the country. “Those who talk about the structure, what do they know about the structure of the military? I don’t think any of us is competent to talk about the structure of the military,” he said. While reminding Nigerians of what the security situation used to be before the coming of this administration in 2015, he assured Nigerians that the new service chiefs have hit the ground running and would ensure Nigeria overcome the insurgency war in the North-East and in other parts of the country.
