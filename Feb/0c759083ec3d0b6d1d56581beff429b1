A dismissed soldier, Johnson Godday, has been arrested by operatives of the Lagos Police Command for alleged robbery. Godday, the police alleged, attacked one Onyebuchi Nwanga, a resident of 24, Bayo Oshinowo Street, Ogudu on Sunday and took his mobile phone. According to a statement last night by spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, Godday committed the alleged offence with another suspect now at large, who was also dressed in army uniform. Adejobi said they attacked their victim and his friends when they alighted from a tricycle at Emmanuel Street Junction, Ogudu. He said the victim reported that as soon as they alighted, they suddenly noticed two men dressed in military uniform and on a motorcycle. “The men attacked and robbed Nwanga of his smart phone. As soon as the robbery occurred, the victims raised the alarm and policemen attached to Ogudu Division on duty around the scene came to their rescue. “They arrested the suspect in army uniform while the other, also in the Nigerian Army uniform, escaped with the motorcyclist. The snatched phone was immediately recovered from the suspect. “In the course of police investigation, Johnson Godday, from Edo State, confessed that he was attached to 149 Batallion, Ojo, Lagos before he was dismissed from the Nigerian Army,” said Adejobi. Similarly, cops attached to the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) apprehended a suspected phone thief who confessed to have stolen over 240 mobile phones from commuters. The suspect, Ayomide Sikiru, 27, a resident of Akala, Mushin, was arrested around 10pm after he successfully picked a Tecno Camon 12 from the handbag of an elderly woman boarding a bus to Ojodu-Berger. “After stealing the phone, the suspect tried to alight from the bus but was restrained by a passenger who challenged him to return the phone he stole.”
