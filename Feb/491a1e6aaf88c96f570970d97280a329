This year’s prestigious Global Tax 50 list which features a rundown of the most influential individuals, movements, organisations and trends in the global tax arena, includes the Executive Secretary of the African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF), Mr Logan Wort, among its top 10 awardees. The Global Tax 50 Awards are published annually by the International Tax Review (ITR) after rigorously assessing what, according to their analysis, have been the most impactful trends, individuals and organisations in the tax world over the past 12 months. According to ITR, ATAF-led Executive Secretary, Mr Logan Wort, has played and continues to play a key role in bridging the gap between the expansion of multinational companies in Africa and the tax challenges faced by businesses in the region, where tax administration and policy are still developing. Founded in 2009, the ATAF has established itself as Africa’s voice on continental and international tax matters; a position that it has further consolidated through its critical representation of Africa’s interests at the on-going global discussions on the taxation of the digital economy, its continuous capacity-building and technical assistance initiatives for African tax authorities and more recently, its rapid response to the COVID-19 induced challenges faced by African tax administrations, which included several consultations with tax authorities and a set of recommended measures to address the impact of the pandemic. At the continental level, ATAF’s active lobbying has resulted in the African Union Commission placing tax as a priority on its agenda which, according to Mr Wort, has also been an important highlight in 2020.
