Mouka has presented a customised Wellbeing Regal orthopaedic mattress to Afeez Agoro, Nigeria’s tallest man, for the quality sleep he desires for his 7 feet 4.58 inches frame. As a company that propagates the importance of quality sleep, Mouka, Nigeria’s foremost manufacturer of branded mattresses and pillows, came to the aid of Agoro, who previously had difficulty finding the right sleep solution. The Mouka Wellbeing range of mattresses is endorsed by both the Nigeria Society of Physiotherapy (NSP) and the National Association of Orthopaedic Manual Therapists (NAOMT). Both associations have certified the Wellbeing range as ergonomically compliant, aligning the spine and relieving tension from pressure points around the body. The Wellbeing Regal full orthopaedic mattress is highly recommended for the elderly and those experiencing back pains. On the gesture, Mouka’s Chief Executive Officer, Raymond Murphy, said the brand is continuously looking at ways to add comfort to Nigerians’ lives, especially those in dire need of relief from body aches and pains.
