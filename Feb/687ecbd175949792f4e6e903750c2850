If you are familiar with the Director General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Otunba Segun Runsewe, you will definitely know he is a man who speaks out once certain things are wrong. Being a cultural ambassador, he has apparently been having sleepless nights because of the activities of popular crossdresser, Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju, better known as Bobrisky, and its influence on the youth. So, when the Cameroonian government took a bold step to arrest a crossdresser known as Shakiro over promotion of homosexuality, Runsewe wondered why the same fate has not been extended to Bobrisky. He said: “Just like in Nigeria where notorious homosexuals and cross dressers have been arrested and released, the jail sentence passed on Cameroonian homosexual promoter vindicates the relentless campaign of the need to rid Nigeria of the presence of homosexuals such as Bobrisky and his likes. “We call upon Nigeria’s highly-revered judiciary to take note of the effrontery and boldness of homosexuals in Nigeria and slam jail sentences that will rid Nigerian society of these deviants so as to protect the young, impressionable minds from the notorious influence. Nigeria is Africa’s biggest black nation and if things go wrong here, Africa will suffer.”
