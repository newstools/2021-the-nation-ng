Lagos State government and the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) have said trucks that are not on the Electronic Call-Up (e-Call-Up) system will not be permitted into Apapa as from tomorrow. A statement on Thursday by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Transportation, Mr. Oluwatoyin Fayinka, said this was among the decisions taken at a meeting at Lilypond Truck Park in Apapa, where both parties agreed on the commencement date. The electronic system will replace the manual call-up system. Shedding light on the development, Fayinka said beginning from 4 p.m tomorrow, all articulated vehicles would be stopped from entering Apapa and its environs while those in the area are to be moved to various transit parks by noon. He said: “It was also jointly agreed upon that by 4 p.m on February 26, 2021 (today), all articulated vehicles will be prevented from entering Apapa and its environs. Subsequently by noon on Saturday, February 27, 2021, trucks in and around the ports’ access roads are expected to have vacated the corridors. There are strong warnings for truck owners and drivers to adhere to the resolutions to prevent harsh reactions from government.”
