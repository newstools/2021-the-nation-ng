A man, Daniel Agbayigolo, was on Monday stabbed to death by his younger brother in Ughoton community in Okpe council area of Delta State. Details of the incident were still sketchy at press time. But it was gathered that Agbayigolo had gone to settle a dispute between his younger brother and his wife. It is believed that his  mediation fueled the couple’s feud rather than settle it. Police confirmed the incident on the telephone, but said the suspect had gone into hiding. Its spokesperson, Onome Onovwakpoyeya, a Superintendent of Police, said, “It is true and the murderer is at large”. Asked what led to the incident, she stated that both were “quarreling”.
