Rights group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), on Friday blamed Zamfara State Government for abduction of 317 school girls in Government Secondary School Jangabe. It said: “The kidnapping of school girls in Jangabe in Zamfara state appears increasingly like it is a clear act of state sponsored terrorism and an act of hostage taking tolerated by the State administration of Zamfara state and the officials from the governor to the members of the Zamfara House of Assembly should be held responsible because that is the act of terrorism that seems to be acceptable to the government of Zamfara state”. HURIWA questioned why the Zamfara Assembly has done nothing to stamp out the emerging trend of kidnapping of students by adopting the harshest legal punishment for such act of terrorism. The group, in a statement in Abuja by the National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko said: “The governor has been quoted in the media of supporting negotiation with bandits and is known or quoted by the media as stating that not all bandits are criminals when the reality shows that all armed bandits are not just criminal. “So the government of Zamfara state should be held responsible and should be told to ensure the safety of these hostages.  In fact the Zamfara Assembly should impeach the Governor for failure to protect the school children, for his inability to discharge his duty to protect school children and for actively defending the so called armed bandits whom he is quoted as allegedly saying that they are not criminals.” HURIWA said the Zamfara Governor and all others who actively preach appeasement for terrorists and kidnappers as well as bandits: “must be punished in accordance with the law which is why we are advocating for his immediate impeachment, arrest and prosecution for failing to protect his people from the violence of TERROR GANGSTERS roaming freely in that part of the country”.
