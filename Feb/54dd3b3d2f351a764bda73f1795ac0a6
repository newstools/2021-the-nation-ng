A middle-aged man who was identified as Augustine Inemesit has reportedly been killed in Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State by unknown gunmen. The gunmen after killing Inemesit reportedly dumped his corpse in drainage opposite Living Word Academy, World Bank, Upstair Line near former Timber Shed. It was learnt that the victim had about two weeks ago packed into his new apartment within the World Bank Housing Estate that is not far from the place of the incident. Our correspondent gathered that the deceased left his house at about 8 pm on Friday situated behind Agbazuere Street by Nnokwa Street to a nearby dumpsite to dispose of refuse, but never made it back home. Many who live around the area expressed worry over the incident but stated that since the victim is a new person in the neighbourhood, they cannot assume if his death could be traced to any “beef” or reprisal attack as being speculated or that he was a victim of an unfortunate circumstance. A source told that the victim had pleaded with his attackers to spare him, but his appeal to the gunmen could not stop them from shooting him in the head, leaving his lifeless body in the nearby gutter. A Police source from the State Command of the Nigeria Police Force confirmed the incident, stating that investigation into the gruesome killing has commenced unraveling the circumstances surrounding Mr. Inemesit’s death. The police, our correspondent gathered, has visited the scene and had since evacuated the corpse to a nearby mortuary.
