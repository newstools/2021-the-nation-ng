 Erstwhile Flying Eagles lynchpin Prince Izuchukwu Omego has finally reunites with Iraqi side Al Sinaa SC after a long period of interregnum. Omego missed out of the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup-winning Golden Eaglets but bounced to win the U-20 AFCON in Senegal with the Flying Eagles en route to the FIFA U-20 World Cup in New Zealand where he featured in all the team’s four matches. Omego had been holed out in Nigeria due to COVID-19 restrictions among other travels logistics but only returned to the Baghdad-based side last week. “ I was really welcomed back to the team because we live here as one big family,” the 24-year-old told NationSports.“ I want to make use of this opportunity and do the best for the club as well as for myself.”
