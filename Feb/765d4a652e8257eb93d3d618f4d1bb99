What comes to mind is the possibility of having a reality in a bus when other reality shows like Big Brother Naija were held in a well decorated houses. But the pilot edition of Empire VIP House On Wheels is set to hold in April after months of delay due to COVID-19 outbreak. The idea was put together by Empire Entertainment, owned by Dickson Aligbe, who is based in the United States. Although he couldn’t make it to the unveiling of the grand prize, other production members were present. A Creative Director of the reality show, Majesty Samson, explained that Empire VIP House On Wheels was not different from all reality shows held in Nigeria in the past. “We are unveiling the grand prize of our reality show today. The show will be done with a bus which has beds, television and other household items. Although the bus mates will be camped in a house, 90 percent of the activities will be done on the road. They will visit different places, including popular markets and engage in tasks. If you have an entrepreneurial skill, this reality show is meant for you,” she stated. Also, she said the show will run for a month with 20 contestants. “The winner goes home with a car and five million naira, while the contestants who emerge second and third will take three million naira and two million naira respectively,” she added. Production Manager, Yakubu Deji, insisted that, unlike many reality shows, the contestants would be allowed to use their phones. He noted: “The idea is to have a reality show where bus mates will go on a tour of Lagos while engaging in different tasks. In the process, the audience will voice and evictions will take place.”
