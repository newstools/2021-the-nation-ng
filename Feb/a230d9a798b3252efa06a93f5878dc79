Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday said his administration would continue to pursue the mass infrastructure delivery vision of late Alhaji Lateef Jakande to enhance connectivity. Sanwo-Olu said although Jakande had been laid to rest, his vision for the state was a pathway which his administration would preserve to open up roads in vulnerable communities for progress. The governor said this during inauguration of the Lagos-Ogun State Boundary Roads, Phase II, in Agbado Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area in Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos State. He said “What Alhaji Lateef Jakande stood for is what we are doing here today,” he said, adding, that the network of roads, located in Abule Egba, Meiran and Agbado ran parallel to the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway and would address gridlock, boost connectivity and address perennial flooding on the axis. The governor said the project was born out of commitment of the government to enhance connectivity, reduce travel time, and stress on communities to boost socio-economic wellbeing. “I am happy that we have been able to provide this model for our people,” Sanwo-Olu said. The governor said the road will appreciate property prices, increase commerce, cut down on travel time and generally improve the quality of lives of the people living in the area. Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Infrastructure, Mrs. Aramide Adeyoye, said the project was in line with the vision of the government to stimulate growth of satellite settlements and border communities. She said Sanwo-Olu had, during inauguration of a network of 31 Strategic Road in Ifako Ijaye in December 2019, directed that the Ministry of Works and Infrastructure must ensure speedy completion of the Lagos-Ogun State Boundary Roads Phase II.
