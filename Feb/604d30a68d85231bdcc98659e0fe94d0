President Muhammadu Buhari will on Thursday honour 110 former National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members who distinguished themselves during the 2018/2019 service year with a presidential award. The award is organised by the NYSC. The event, which will hold at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa in Abuja, will be virtually held from his office. The award is for distinguished national service in orientation course, primary assignment, community development service; and winding up/passing out. “This is one of the numerous avenues by which the scheme has been rewarding excellent performance of Corps members that distinguished themselves by providing developmental projects that would benefit their host communities while serving,” Emeka Mgbemena, Chairman of Protocol and Publicity Committee, said in a statement in Abuja.
