 Nnamdi Ofoborh is aiming to play in the Champions League with Rangers after signing a pre-contract with the Premiership giants last Monday. The former Nigeria U20 midfielder will start a new adventure in Scotland in the summer after agreeing to a four-year deal with the Gers before the close of the January transfer window. He also sealed a loan move to Wycombe Wanderers on deadline day after struggling for playing time at Bournemouth, making no appearance in the Championship. Ofoborh raved about the prospect of playing with the Premiership leaders and also fulfil his boyhood ambition of playing in the top European competition if the Gers win the league this season. “It has always been a dream for me to play in the Champions League,” Ofoborh reportedly said. \ Mail via Daily Record. “I’m a person who is confident in my ability and I’ve been through a lot already in my career. “But I always told my friends that one day I’ll play in that tournament. If I get that chance at Rangers, I’ll have done it way earlier than I expected. “It would be a massive achievement for me. I’m buzzing about the move. It’s still a bit surreal to me that I’m actually joining a club like Rangers. I just can’t wait to get up there, get started and do what I need to do.”
