The Department of State Services (DSS) on Saturday admitted that former media aide to Kano Governor Salihu Tanko-Yakasai is in its custody. Yakassai was sacked by Ganduje for asking President Muhammadu Buhari to fix insecurity or resign in a social media post. He was reported to have been arrested after he was sacked with some also insinuating he ‘disappeared’. But the DSS cleared the air on his whereabouts in a statement by its Public Relations Officer Department of State Services, Dr Peter Afunanya. He said: “This is to confirm that Salihu Tanko-Yakasai is with the Department of State Services. “He is being investigated over issues beyond the expression of opinions in the social media as wrongly alleged by sections of the public.”
