House of Representatives on Wednesday constituted an ad-hoc committee to screen the new Service Chiefs. President Muhammadu Buhari, in a letter to the Speaker, said his request for their confirmation was in line with the Armed Forces Act. Section 18 (1) of the Act provides: “The President may, after consultation with the Chief of Defence Staff and subject to the confirmation by the National Assembly, appoint such officers (in this Act referred to as ‘Service Chiefs’) as he thinks fit, in whom the command of the Army, Navy and Air Force, as the case may be, and their Reserves shall be vested.” The Service Chiefs are Chief of Defence Staff, Maj. Gen. Lucky lrabor; Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo, and Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao. The committee consists of six members each from the House committees on Army, Navy, Air Force and Defence. It will be headed by the House Committee Chairman on Defence, Babajimi Benson. The Speaker said allowing the various committees to meet would result in crowding about 200 people inside a room and would violate COVID-19 protocols.
