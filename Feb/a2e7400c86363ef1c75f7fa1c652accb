Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, on Friday, condemned the attempt by security operatives to arrest Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho. Afenifere spokesman, Yinka Odumakin, said the machinery of government would not have been after Igboho were he a bandit. Pandemonium broke out on Friday along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway when Igboho and his supporters were on their way to meet with 93-year-old Afenifere chieftain, Ayo Adebanjo. In a viral video, a topless Igboho was seen with his men daring the security operatives and throwing expletives. Speaking on the incident, Odumakin said: “There is no sense in that (the attempted arrest). He (Igboho) is a free citizen of Nigeria. If they need him for any questioning, they should invite him not to go and waylay him on way like an armed robber. “We condemn their attempt. There is no need for it. He has not been invited let alone not honouring the invitation. Chasing him on the road is condemnable.” The Afenifere spokesman lamented the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari favoured bandits who have been left roaming the country despite their many atrocities. When asked whether the group was concerned that security agencies were after Igboho and not bandits, the Afenifere spokesman said: “Sunday Igboho is not a bandit. Bandits are special under this administration. That is the difference between a bandit and a non-bandit in Nigeria today,” Odumakin stressed.
