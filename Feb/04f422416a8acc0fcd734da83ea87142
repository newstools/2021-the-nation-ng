The family of Deputy Superintendent of Customs Jimoh Folowosele, suspected to have been kidnapped by Boko Haram insurgents, has appealed to the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Col. Hameed Ali, not to allow their son to die in captivity. Folowosele, an indigene of Aramoko Ekiti, the headquarters Ekiti West Local Government of Ekiti State, was kidnapped on February 9 by suspected Boko Haram insurgents while on official duty in Geidam, a border town in Yobe State, alongside other officers. The dejected family, who yesterday made the plea while addressing reporters in Ado-Ekiti, accused the Customs authority of non-chalance towards the release of the kidnapped officers from Boko Haram’s den. Speaking on behalf of the family, the victim’s brother, Idowu Folowosele, said the abduction of their brother has thrown the family into confusion, urging the Nigeria Customs Service to speed up action that would aid his release. A friend of the kidnapped Customs officer, Mr. Fola Ayedun, who condemned the abduction, appealed to the Customs authority to put family members into confidence on the strategic moves being taken on how Folowosele would be released.
