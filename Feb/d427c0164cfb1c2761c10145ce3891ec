Analysts at Cowry Asset Management said they expected Nigerian equities to rebound as investors seek for bargains in the market given the lower re-entry prices for stocks with good fundamentals and dividend history ahead of the audited full year 2020 financial results and the announcements of their dividend payment. The analysts added that the possibility of increased returns in fixed-income market may moderate trading in the days ahead. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros stated.
