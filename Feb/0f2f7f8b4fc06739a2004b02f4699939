An Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abduljabar Nasir Kabara, is debarred by the Kano State government from preaching in the state for alleged incitement. All seminaries run by the Sheikh have also been shut down even as security agencies have launched an investigation into his activities. Some Muslim faithful have criticised the decision by the state government. Kabara, whose mode of Islamic teachings is considered incendiary by the Kano state government, has come under scrutiny because of his interpretation of some prophetic sayings adjudged as controversial. He is being accused of questioning the authenticity of those prophetic sayings and even denouncing some companions of the prophet. Briefing reporters, the State Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, said the decision to ban Kabara from preaching in the state was taken by the State Executive Council (SEC) during its meeting at Africa House, Kano. Malam Garba said: “Kano State government has debarred an Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abduljabar Nasir Kabara, from preaching in the state for his mode of teachings are considered too incendiary. “The state government has directed all broadcast stations and social media platforms to abstain from airing such enflaming preachings, sermons, propagation, and any other religious discussions in the interest of peace and tranquility in the state. “All seminaries run by the cleric have been shut down pending investigation by security agencies. “Security agencies have been directed to ensure full compliance and take decisive action against any person or group found flouting the order.”
