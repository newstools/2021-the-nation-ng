For the boat to win, it is very important that each member of the team give his all, with precision, even when exhausted.

Therefore, as a team aiming to achieve a goal, we must be precise and be ready to encourage one another to succeed. In football, it is very important that each team member not only knows his assignment, but more importantly, carry out his assignment accordingly and with discipline.
