 Omenka Uzoma Day, singer and manager of late reggae icon, Majek Fashek, has released the music video to his single, ‘Celebrate!’ Uzo who is MD/CEO, Miracle Day Music said though he’s still mourning Majek, he has decided to pick up the pieces of his music career to rebrand and return to the scene. Talking about his latest effort shot in Capetown, South Africa, and directed by Nani Chehore, Uzo says: “The world is changing and perhaps might never become what it used to be. New realities, fears, suspicions, and confusion are causing anxieties and worries. Keeping safe during a pandemic, staying safe amidst news of banditry and kidnapping, news of insurrection are all countless worries we deal with regularly that sometimes we forget to acknowledge some of our other daily blessings. “Renewed hope of a new dawn, joy of a newborn, enjoyed friendship, loving families, and many more positive vibes are some of the things we take for granted while we focus so much on little challenges. Today I implore you to ‘Celebrate’ your little wins, be thankful for the privilege of life and living, and rekindle the hope for a brighter tomorrow,” Uzo says. In November 2020, Uzo released two singles with their videos: ‘Walk Without You’ (a tribute to Majek Fashek) and ‘God bless Lagos’…dedicated to the aquatic city Lagos.
