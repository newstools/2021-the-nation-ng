The Lekki Concession Company (LCC) has said there will be no immediate reopening of and tolling at the Admiralty Circle Toll Plaza, otherwise known as Lekki Toll Gate Plaza. The firm regained possession of the facility following a February 6 ruling of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Enquiry and Restitution for Victims of SARS related abuses and the Lekki Toll Gate incident of October 20. But the panel’s decision was opposed by some youths, about 40 of whom were arrested at the facility on Saturday while demonstrating against it, as part of the #EndSARS Season 2 and #OccupyLekkiTollgate movement. But in a press briefing Monday afternoon, LCC Managing Director, Yomi Omomuwasan, said tolling was not the first item on the firm’s menu since recovering possession. He said: “It does not mean that when we take possession, once we rebuild or once we take possession or finish the evaluation and the next thing is to start tolling. No. It takes a process. People are engaging us to say, ‘How do we offer a better service, how do we improve our services and we are ready to listen to that kind of good feedback. So, we need to work on a lot if things internally before you see us starting to toll.”
