Barely 72 hours after 21 people were kidnapped in the state mass transit bus, 24 people have been kidnapped and 10 others killed in a recent raid by bandits in communities in Rafi local government area of Niger state. The raid which occurred on Tuesday afternoon led to the death of the Village Head of Kusherki in Rafi local government area, Alhaji Masud Abubakar and the abduction of his wife. Majority of those killed were said to be vigilantes who tried to stop the bandits from operating but were killed because their weapons could not meet up with the sophisticated weapons said to have been carried by the bandits. Eyewitnesses said the attack began at about 12.30 pm and lasted for about three hours. The Nation learnt that the helicopter was hovering in the air while the attacks were going on. The Secretary to the Chairman of Rafi local government area, Mr. James Isaac Jagaba confirmed the report. A statement by the government further confirmed the attack as the Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello expressed outrage at the killing of the Village Head of Kusherki in Rafi Local Government Area Mas’ud Abubakar alongside others and the abduction of 24 others. The Governor lamented that the increasing activities of kidnappers and bandits in the state are becoming a nightmare to the people. “The situation, particularly in the last 72 hours, has become regrettably alarming! While efforts are ongoing to secure the release of the abducted NSTA passengers, we heard that of Kusherki and other areas. We are witnessing these attacks now, almost, on daily basis and it is worrisome,” the statement said. The Governor said the state government will not be deterred nor discouraged by the recent turn of events stressing that the existing collective resolve of government, security agencies and the people must be sustained to checkmate the situation.
