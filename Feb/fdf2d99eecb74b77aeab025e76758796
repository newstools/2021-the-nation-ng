The leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has described Senator Smart Adeyemi’s verbal attack on the Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, as irresponsible. The PDP said Senator Adeyemi exhibited a high level of irresponsibility by using the privileges of the Senate chamber to engage in unprovoked disparagement of Governor Ikpeazu and the entire people of Abia State, who had not offended him in any way. In a statement on Wednesday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said it’s unfortunate that Senator Adeyemi, whose words were respected by Nigerians while he was in the PDP has become so corrupted by his sojourn in the All Progressives Congress (APC), that he has completely lost his mind just to satisfy some new gods. The statement said in part: “Senator Adeyemi must have noted the widespread national detestation and opprobrium that he had brought to himself by his unguarded comments against the highly respected Governor Ikpeazu and the people of Abia state. “Moreover, our party has equally noted that Senator Adeyemi’s uncouth comment is borne out of bitter envy for the achievements of Governor Ikpeazu in every sector of life in Abia state, which no APC governor, including Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State can compare.” The PDP warned that it would not stomach any such unwarranted and unprovoked attack on any of its governors and vowed to deploy all instruments provided in a democratic setting against such individual. The party urged Governor Ikpeazu not to be distracted by “sidetracking elements like Senator Adeyemi,” but to continue to deliver the dividends of democracy to his people. Senator Adeyemi had, while making contributions on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, described Ikpeazu as a “champagne drinking” governor and a habitual drunk.
