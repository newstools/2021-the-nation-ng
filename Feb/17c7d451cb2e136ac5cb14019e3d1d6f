 Nollywood actress Lilian Okolie has expressed her desire to play the role of Ramsey Nouah’s girlfriend in a film. The actress recently made this known in an exclusive chat with The Nation saying, “I would love to play Ramsey Nouah’s girlfriend.” The beautiful actress went on to say she used to have a crush on Nouah and Richard Mofe Damijo while she was much younger. “I used to crush on Richard Mofe – Damijo, Ramsey Noah when I was much younger.” Okolie revealed that she looks forward to also working with Hilda Dokubo, whom many say shares some sort of resemblance with her. She said, “I would love most to work with Hilda Dokubo. People tell me that I look like her. I grew up having that Hilda tag. I have once spoken to her on the phone through the late chico Ejiro but I have not met her. I look forward to working with her on a movie set.” Lillian Okolie’s foray into Nollywood is as interesting as her permanent smiles; a regular feature on her smooth face. Unlike stories of woes that you hear actors talk about when they join the film industry, Okolie’s case is the direct opposite. She had a smooth ride from her feature in Blackberry Babes II in 2011 and has continued in such a pattern.
