Serena Williams has withdrawn from her Yarra Valley Classic semi-final against world number one Ashleigh Barty with a right shoulder injury. Williams had earlier beaten fellow American Danielle Collins 6-2 4-6 10-6 in the last eight in Melbourne. Australian Barty, who won 7-5 2-6 10-4 against American Shelby Rogers, has received a walkover into the final. Williams will be seeking a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open. The first Slam of the year begins on Monday and all six ATP and WTA warm-up events are being held at Melbourne Park. Williams, 39, won her last major title at the Australian Open in 2017. She missed the 2018 competition and reached the quarter-finals in 2019, but fell in the third round last year.
