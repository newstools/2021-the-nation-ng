Labour unions in Oyo State-owned tertiary institutions have issued a seven-day ultimatum to the state government to sack the consultant appointed to authorise all spending of the institutions. Gathering under the auspices of the Joint Action Committee of Trade Unions (JAC), the unions described the appointment of a consultant to authorise all spending by tertiary institutions as an aberration to the edict establishing the institutions. JAC said the appointment was also creating bottleneck for financial decisions, a development it said was unhealthy for the smooth running of the institutions. Chief executives of the institutions seek approval of the consultant on expenses. They cannot spend any sum without the company’s approval, notwithstanding the existence of board of management and management staff. JAC include ASUP, COEASU, SSANIP and SSUCOEN at Emmanuel Alayande College of Education, Oyo; Oke-Ogun Polytechnic, Saki; Adeseun Ogundoyin Polytechnic, Eruwa;  College of Education, Lanlate and Oyo State College of Agriculture and Technology, Igbo-Ora. They urged Governor Seyi Makinde to terminate the appointment or face industrial action. The body took the decision at its meeting held at the Oke-Ogun Polytechnic, Saki.
