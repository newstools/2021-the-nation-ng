Brendan Rodgers’ side emerged as 1-0 victors following their clash with Brighton & Hove Albion at King Power Stadium, with Iheanacho nodding in Youri Tielemans’ cross for his sixth goal of the season in all competitions. Iheanacho admitted at full-time that his side were delighted to settle the tie in normal time. “I’m really happy,” the striker told LCFC TV. “Everyone is smiling. It’s too cold so everyone wants to get home and I’m really happy to get the winner today in 90 minutes. “It’s one of those games, it’s really freezing. So, everybody’s cold: people playing and people on the bench. So, when I scored, everybody in the stands, we’re happy. It’s really cold, they want to get in and go home! But it’s a fantastic game and we are looking forward now to the next round.” While Iheanacho believes it would be a huge achievement to win the FA Cup, Leicester’s game-by-game mantra will not change. The most important thing is we went through to the next round,” he explained when asked about his side’s desire for success in 2020/21. “It would be a dream, most especially for the fans and for Leicester City. They’ve been waiting so many years for this. Hopefully we can do it this season.”
