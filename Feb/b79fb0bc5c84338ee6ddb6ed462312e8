Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, has told the Federal Government to channel its energy towards arresting Boko Haram leader, Ibrahim Shekau and Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, who has been holding meetings with bandits. He was reacting to a face-off between him and security agents around the Guru Maharaji bus stop on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The Yoruba activist, who has been in the news for serving a quit notice on herdsmen in some parts of the South-West, said he was never invited before they attempted to arrest him. He told The Punch in an interview: “Go and ask them to invite Gumi and Shekau first before disturbing me. Let them face the bandits instead.” Igboho also said he would not run, adding that he had returned to his base in Ibadan. When asked if he would go into hiding, he said: “What for? I am in the neighbourhood. I cannot run.” Igboho said his bank account was initially frozen but the restriction was lifted recently. He said he had done nothing wrong but fight for the rights of his people.
