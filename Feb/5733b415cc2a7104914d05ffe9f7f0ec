The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested two fake military officers with 394 compressed parcels of Cannabis Sativa. They were intercepted in a new VIP edition of Toyota Hilux SUV loaded with the substance that weighed 234kg. The fake military officers Mohammed Nura and Abubakar Dahiru apprehended on Okene-Lokoja Expressway on Monday by operatives of the Kogi State Command of the NDLEA. NDLEA Commander in the state Adewunmi Alfred said a thorough search of the Hilux vehicle yielded 394 compressed blocks of cannabis sativa hidden in various compartments. “Our initial investigations have revealed that the consignment was taken from Lagos and heading to Kano for delivery. Though the two men identified themselves as military officers but that did not sway our men from a thorough search of their vehicle and the result was the discovery of the illicit drugs tucked in every hidden part of the vehicle,” he said. He said the vehicle was impounded, the illicit drugs seized and the suspects detained for further investigations.
