Last week, the Federal Government urged Nigerians not to relax or be too quick to interpret the recent drop in COVID-19 cases to mean a decline in the rate of spread of the pandemic. It, therefore, encouraged everyone to continue to observe and adhere to the non-pharmaceutical measures such as physical distancing, regular hand washing, use of hand sanitisers, observance of respiratory hygiene, avoiding crowded places and wearing appropriate face masks that also cover the noses. Globally, according to recent reports from the World Health Organisation (WHO), as of February 21, 2021, a total of 2,455,131 people have lost their lives, with 110,749,023 confirmed cases.
