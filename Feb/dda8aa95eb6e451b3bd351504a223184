First Vice President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Seyi Akinwunmi, believes with the crop of players in the Super Eagles, the team is certain of making it to 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Akinwunmi said plans are afoot by Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr to ensure that the team picks the tickets for the two important football events. “Nigeria will surely qualify for both the AFCON in Cameroon and Mundial in Qatar, after all the coach has been mapping out his strategies on how to win the next match against Benin Republic in Cotonou as well as the match against  Lesotho in Lagos a few days after. “Also, for instance, Rohr came to Lagos last weekend to inspect the stadium facilities ahead of the next match against Lesotho in Lagos shortly after the Benin Republic match and he has been doing a lot to ensure the Eagles pick maximum points in the remaining AFCON qualifiers,” he stated. Nigeria is currently topping the group with eight points, having played four matches out of six in the AFCON 2021 qualifiers, beating Lesotho 4-1 at home, defeated Benin 2-1, and drew against Leone Stars of Sierra Leone 4-4 and 0-0 home and away last year. To qualify for the tournament, Nigeria needs a draw against Benin who is trailing her with seven points, while Leone Stars are third on the table with three points. On Super Eagles’ shambolic display against Sierra Leone at Ogbe Stadium last year, Akinwunmi said that was in the past, “such situations cannot be ruled out in football, as the team has been rejuvenated for future challenges.”
