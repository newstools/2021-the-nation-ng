Mauritian Prime Minister, Pravind Jugnauth, on Monday said that the population must not forget the devastation caused by slavery before its abolition in 1835. He was speaking at an official ceremony commemorating the 186th anniversary of the Abolition of Slavery held at Le Morne Village, a historic location declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 2008, in the south-western part of the island. Prime Minister Jugnauth said: “We must always remember this so that humanity does not commit this horror again as the slaves experienced the worst possible humiliations.” He added that it is imperative to pay tribute to the people who have shed their sweat and blood so as to build today’s Mauritius. Mr Jugnauth emphasised that it is with this spirit that the government has announced a project for the construction of an Intercontinental Museum of Slavery in Port Louis. “The first phase of this project started back in October 2020 and the museum will be constructed in the building which was used during the French colonisation period as a military hospital,” he said. According to him, the government considers the implementation of this project a priority “so as to remember the slaves who have contributed in plantations, road and building constructions as well as other infrastructural projects”. The Prime Minister said that it is urgent to bring about a development process that takes on board all the population and their welfare. To that end, he announced the construction of 12,000 housing units for low-income earners. He also reiterated his determination to fight against discrimination, exclusion and inequality. (PANA/NAN)
