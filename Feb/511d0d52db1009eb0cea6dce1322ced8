 The Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) has raised the alarm over attempts by fraudsters to dupe unsuspecting members of the public capitalising on the delay in payment of stipends to ex-agitators. The Interim Administrator, PAP, Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (retd), in a statement in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, said unscrupulous elements were circulating messages claiming to have been appointed to represent the Niger Delta crisis-ridden communities for monthly remittances under the Presidential Amnesty Scholarship Programme. Dikio warned members of the public against sending their personal details to the telephone number provided by the scammers. This is even as PAP has changed its empowerment strategy for ex-agitators to reduce their over-dependence on monthly stipends. Dixon Dikio explained that PAP would henceforth adopt the Southeast Business Model with a focus to transform delegates into skilled entrepreneurs and employable citizens. The Interim Administrator, in a statement signed by his Special Adviser, Media, Nneotaobase Egbe, said the new model was designed to make trainees contribute meaningfully to the economy of the Niger Delta region instead of relying on handouts. “This is the model that is used by most businesses and organisations in the Southeast and this has proven to be highly successful and effective,” he said.
