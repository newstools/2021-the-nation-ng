 The Bayelsa State Police Command says its operatives have arrested two suspected thieves with a truckload of mattresses. It was gathered that the mattresses were part of the palliative items gifted to the state due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It has yet to be established how they got access to the warehouse where the items were kept and who facilitated the theft of the mattresses. Spokesman for the Bayelsa State Police Command, Asinim Butswat, a Superintendent of Police, said the suspects were caught through a tip off. Butswat said in a statement on Friday: “Following a tip off, operatives of Bayelsa State Police Command have arrested one Shehu Yola, male, 42 years and one Sunday Emmanuel, male, 28 years, at Okaka in Yenagoa, the state capital. “The suspects were arrested on 18 February 2021, at about 2100 hours, with a truckload of mattresses suspected to be stolen property.” He said the state Commissioner of Police, Mike Okoli, had ordered a discreet investigation to unravel the source of the mattresses.
