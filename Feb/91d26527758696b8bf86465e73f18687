  Nigeria international Josh Maja said he can’t contain his excitement as a loanne from Bordeaux to Fulham for the remainder of the season. The loan move to the Cottagers will expectedly afford him the chance to stage a return to the English league where he had starred for Sunderland and Manchester City. The 22-year-old striker will remain with Fulham for the remainder of the 2020/21 campaign, with an option for the deal to be made permanent and he told the club’s official website that he sees his move to the Craven Cottage as a big platform for him. Speaking to club’s official website after signing, Maja said: “I’m really excited and proud to sign for Fulham on loan for the remainder of the season. “This is a big opportunity and I look forward to meeting up with the team and working hard to achieve positive results.” It must definitely be the 2018/19 campaign that Maja would look back on as the year he well and truly announced himself, when he scored 16 goals by mid-January and boasted the best goals (0.63) per game ratio in League One. It was the form that persuaded Bordeaux to take him to France, where last season he scored seven goals, including a hat-trick against Nimes. Maja’s performances in Ligue 1 earned him a first call-up to the Nigeria international squad in September 2019, and he made his debut that same month in a team that also featured Ola Aina.
