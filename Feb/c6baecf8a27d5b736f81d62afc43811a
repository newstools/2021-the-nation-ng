21 people have been killed and 40 others kidnapped as bandits attacked four communities in Shiroro local government area of Niger state. Sources said that the attack which occurred on Monday evening had many other villagers injured. It was gathered that over 100 gunmen stormed the four communities of Kurebe, Sabon Gida, Sararai and Rafin Kanya at different times on Monday. The gunmen came in their usual style of riding motorcycles and shooting sporadically into the air causing the people to scamper away to safety. An eyewitness said that there was confusion especially as the bandits went from one house to another shooting and abducting people. “They seem to know who they were looking for. It was very terrible. I sustained an injury on my legs and I am currently receiving treatment”, he told The Nation on phone. Secretary to the Niger State Government, Ahmed Ibrahim Matane has confirmed the incident. He said that the number of people killed or abducted is currently unknown adding that government is putting in mechanism to bring an end to the incessant bandit attacks. The Co-Convener of Concerned Shiroro Youths, Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki also confirmed the attack saying it was a day of total blackout in Shiroro local government area. He lamented that terrorists have continued to have a field day in the council sacking the communities with gusto and crass impunity. “Arising from the nefarious activities of these bandits, Internally Displaced Persons are conspicuously littered everywhere, helter-skelter and scampering for peace and safety. Unfortunately, nothing is being done by the authorities concerned to salvage the ugly situation,” he added.
