 Watford’s defender William Troost-Ekong has reportedly admitted culpability in his side’s 2-1 loss to OQP on Monday night, even as he rallied his teammates to be more proactive and attacking minded in future games. He, however, accepted blame for getting the wrong side of Charlie Austin for the equalising goal. “We never really got going, especially in the first half,” he told Hive Live Extra. “After the goal we got a bit of a lift, but we have to be honest. I have to be honest with myself as well, I should’ve done better with the first goal. “It’s been difficult because we were defending a lot and you’re going to make mistakes, and today QPR capitalised on those. We need to get more on the front foot. “When we got possession of the ball we were in our half. QPR pinned us back for moments of the game, it was a long way to the other goal and we didn’t capitalise enough on the space in behind. “We have to create more because when you’re playing at home you try to take the game to them, otherwise it’s difficult to hang on for so long and not concede. We need to attack better as a team to try and create more opportunities.” Conceding a last-minute winner always hurts, and Troost-Ekong said those in the dressing room share the disappointment of those who were following the game from afar. “It’s just as frustrating for us. The difficulty is that we can’t show that emotion too much, you don’t want to get distracted because you’re focused on your job,” he said. “Everyone knows today wasn’t good enough. We all have to look in the mirror and look at what we’ve done, starting with me. “It’s going to happen during the season and we have to learn from it today and pick ourselves up, because this weekend is going to be a massive game again.”
