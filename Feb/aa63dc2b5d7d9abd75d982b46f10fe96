Ex-Big Brother Naija Housemate Aisha Umaru better known as Kaisha, has denied kissing fellow reality TV star Kiddwaya after a video of the two went viral on Saturday night. The video recorded at the birthday party of another Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate Praise Nelson shows Kiddwaya, born Terseer Waya, pouring alcohol in Kaisha’s mouth and making a move as if he wanted to kiss her. It prompted many social media users to accuse Kaisha of attempting to steal Kiddwaya from Erica Nlewedim. Reacting in a series of tweets on Sunday morning, Kaisha said she had too much to drink at the party and did not remember kissing Kiddwaya. “Kidd is like a brother to me and I have never imagined kissing Kidd! Never!!! It’s my fault that I was careless last night; I had too much to drink,” she said. She also posted the complete video which shows Kiddwaya eventually moving his mouth away from hers before any kissing took place.
