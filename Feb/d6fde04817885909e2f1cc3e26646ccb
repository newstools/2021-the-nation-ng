The 42 people abducted by bandits in Government Science College Kagara have regained freedom. They include 27 pupils, three staff members and 12 members of their families. Also on Sunday, abducted passengers of a Niger State transport corporation bus were released and arrived in Minna. The pupils and staff members were abducted last Wednesday. The attackers, dressed in military uniforms and masks, stormed the school hostels to take away children, some of whom escaped during the incident. President Muhammadu Buhari condemned “the cowardly attack on innocent school children” and vowed to secure their release. A pupil, simply identified as Ndako, recounting his harrowing experience, said: “I ran into the bush. It was dark and they were shooting but I kept running seriously. “Luckily, I got to a house and hid behind it. Three other students met me and we stayed there till morning when we came out.” A staff member, Aliyu Isah, who said his family members were abducted, added that he could not believe he came out of the ordeal alive.
