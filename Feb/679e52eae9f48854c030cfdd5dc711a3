According to the report, over 30 truckloads of soldiers and helicopters were hovering the area and passersby being drilled. But in a quick reaction, the Vice President of the apex Igbo sociocultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Damian Okeke-Ogene, told The Nation that the body does not react to what he described as ‘social media’ propaganda He said the State where they claimed such action was taking place had a Governor, adding that until Ohanaeze got first-hand information on such issue, it would not react on hearsay Okeke-Ogene said, “Ohanaeze cannot react to such. We are an organized body representing Ndigbo and we don’t act on hearsay “There is a Governor in that State and until we hear from him. Ohanaeze does not react without proper investigation.
