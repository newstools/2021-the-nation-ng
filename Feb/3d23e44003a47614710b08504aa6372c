The Management of Kaduna State University (KASU) has described as Fake news, trending social media posts purporting a change of name for Kaduna State University to Magajin Garin Zazzau Sambo University. “The Management of Kaduna State University wishes to notify the public that the news of the renaming of the university from Kaduna State University to Magajin Garin Zazzau Sambo University is fake news”, the Registrar of the institution, Mr Samuel Manshop, said in a statement in Kaduna, on Sunday. “The public is hereby urged to disregard the information as it is the handiwork of mischief- makers,” Manshop said. In a related development, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Muhammad Tanko, has equally disassociated himself from a Facebook Account recently opened in his name. “The public is hereby warned to disregard the account. It is the handiwork of miscreants and mischief-makers,” Tanko said, in a statement, also on Sunday. (NAN)
