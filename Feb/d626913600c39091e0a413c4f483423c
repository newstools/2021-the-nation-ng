The Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) and Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) in the Lagos State University (LASU) have suspended their strike. The unions, under the aegis of Joint Action Committee (JAC), went on strike on February 5 to protest their unpaid minimum wage arrears and other demands. They also demanded for payment of their earned allowances and rightful position. NASU Chairman Moruf Sanni said the strike was suspended to honour Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. “We had a virtual meeting with the government on Wednesday, and we were begged to honour the governor by suspending the strike. “After the suspension, we can come back to negotiate with the government. We believe that the governor will do whatever he says,” Sanni said. Public Relations Officer of the Students Union Government (SUG) Zaenab Adams said the students were yet to return to campus. Adams said the university management would be meeting today to discuss and announce a resumption date so that examinations can be concluded.
