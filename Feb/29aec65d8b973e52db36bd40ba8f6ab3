  Terem Moffi is staking a claim for a dream Super Eagles call up after yet another brilliant performance for FC Lorient in the French first division. This time, the 21 year-old forward posted a Man-of-the-Match performance with two goals for the Merlucciidaes to draw 2-2 at AS Monaco yesterday. Moffi open scoring for Christophe Pélissier’s team after seven minutes from the penalty spot before he made it 2-1 for his team in the 62nd minute. “He (Moffi) is showing his true level,” Pelissier said after the game. “I followed him a lot last season, he gives us a lot in terms of power and offensive quality.” Remember, just last weekend super-sub Moffi was Lorient’s hero having scored the winning goal as Les Merlus shocked Paris Saint-Germain 3-2 and in the Coupe de France clash with Paris FC midweek, Moffi needed just 3 minutes to announce his presence, coming on in the 80th minute and scoring the winner in the 83rd minute. Moffi, who joined Lorient from KV Kortrijk in Belgium for Eight million Euros in October, has been in scintillating form in all competitions with eight goals in his last nine games; becoming the top scorer in Ligue 1 in 2021.
