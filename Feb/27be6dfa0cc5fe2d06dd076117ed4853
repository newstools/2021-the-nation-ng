Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has placed a ban on all forms of campaigns by his appointees, either for themselves or for others ahead of the 2023 elections. The Governor who announced the ban while interacting with journalists on Wednesday at Government House Makurdi, said it was too early for any of his appointees to engage in campaigns or political consultations, as the 2023 polls are still two and a half years away. He stated that the present administration has the mandate to deliver good governance to the people and does not need distractions. Ortom said any of his appointees who fails to obey the directive will have to resign and concentrate on campaigning for 2023, stressing that it would amount to conflict of interests to remain in government and be campaigning for political positions. The Governor directed Secretary to the State Government, Professor Anthony Ijohor, SAN, to communicate the decision to all appointees. Speaking on security, Ortom called on the Federal Government to act fast and address the insecurity in parts of the country, beginning with the arrest of all armed herdsmen and other individuals terrorizing innocent Nigerians as the first step to restore peace and guarantee the safety of lives and property. He said only sincerity of purpose by the Federal Government in tackling the menace of herdsmen attacks could calm tensions and build confidence among Nigerians. Ortom expressed delight that Benue was the first among states to enact a law prohibiting open grazing of animals and introducing ranching as the alternative which is now being embraced by other states as the best measure for ending the nomadic pattern of animal husbandry, which often leads to conflicts between herders and farmers. He also used the occasion to announced that he has recovered from COVID 19.
