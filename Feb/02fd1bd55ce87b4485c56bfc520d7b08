To boost its education delivery, Rotary Club (RC) of Onigbongbo has donated an e-learning centre to Wasimi Community Senior High School, Onigbongbo, Lagos State. Making the donation, the club’s President Prince Aderotoye Adebowale said he inherited the project from his predecessor and that it would have been completed since last September but for COVID-19 lockdown and #EndSARS protests. He listed Rotary International Districts 9110, 9455 (Australia), 3610 (South Korea), 17 clubs and Rotary Foundation as some of those that partnered with it, thanking them for their gestures.

He said 12 public schools were chosen in the district, including Wasimi Community Senior High School. “The project in each school cost over N2.5million,” he added.
