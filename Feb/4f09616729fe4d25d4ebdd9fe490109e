  Having watched Aminu brothers – Al Farouq and Alade played for Nigeria’s D’Tigers at the FIBA AfroBasket 2015, the Iroegbu brothers are hoping to follow the footsteps of their compatriot for the 2021 edition holding in Rwanda. Ikenna and Uche Iroegbu were part of the D’Tigers squad that featured in the just concluded FIBA Afrobasket qualifiers in Monastir, Tunisia and the Iroegbu brothers believe they can add value to the team. Ike played at the FIBA AfroBasket 2017 in Tunisia inspiring D’Tigers to the final and has been a core member of the team ever since and Uche wants to follow that path and stay on the team. Both Iroegbu brothers are point guards but Ike can play as a shooting guard as well and this arrangement is one that worked for them at the tournament in Monastir. “It is great to see him finally playing on the national team because he works so hard and I see it day in, day out working on court so seeing him making his debut here in Monastir and for me to be alongside him is just incredible,” Ikenna who is commonly known as Ike said about Uche. Uche told FIBA.com that, “It was a great experience. When you are on court and as soon as you taste the ball, your mind just settles down and you just play basketball. When I am in the game, I am a competitor and when I see my brother, I just feel like I have to play as hard as I can.” Nigeria have qualified for the FIBA AfroBasket 2021 set to take place in Rwanda from August 24 to September 5 after featuring at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics from July 23 to August 8.
