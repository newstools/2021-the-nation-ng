 Should you like to be noticed in any crowd? The fact of the matter is that face and the head is where you make the first impression. It is therefore good to think of ways to highlight your advantage in these areas. That explains why hairdos, make-up and other accessories get so much attention. One creative way to complement your look is by wearing a head wrap or headgear that is stylish. This usually takes the wearer from the ordinary to looking super gorgeous. A single, double or multi colour helps you to create that dramatic look. The effects and the drama you want to create determine the fabric type. You can therefore go for soft and smaller wraps if you want a simple outlook. However, if you want a super knot, you would definitely need something bigger and bolder. A simple scarf, net, turban and other wraps make great fashion statements when tied stylishly.
