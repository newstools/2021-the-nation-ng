The National Working Committee (NWC) of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has fixed March 6, 2021 for the party’s zonal congresses across the six geo-political zones. A statement on Wednesday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said aspirants for the various offices are expected to submit their nomination forms by February 25, 2021. By this, the party has slated the submission of nomination forms, including aspirants for National Ex-Officio for on or before February 25, 2021. In a separate statement, the party announced the lifting of suspension placed on six of its members in the House of Representatives. The affected members are Ndudi Elumelu, Toby Okechukwu, Wole Oke, Lynda Ikpeazu, Anayo Edwin, Gideon Gwani, and Adekoya Addul-majid. “The National Working Committee (NWC) notes that the lifting of the suspension was based on the recommendations of various committees set on issues relating to the suspension. “The party charges the lawmakers to be loyal to the party and obey its directives in line with its constitution and vision of its founding fathers. “In the same vein, the party maintains that it continues to recognize the PDP Caucus of the House of Representatives as led by Hon. Kingsley Chinda and charged all members elected on the platform of the party to continue to participate in the activities of the Caucus,” the statement said. The members were suspended in July 2019 following the emergence of Elumelu as Minority Leader in the House, against the party’s choice of Kingsley Chinda.
