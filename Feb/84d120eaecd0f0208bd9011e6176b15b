The African Civic Engagement Academy (ACEA) is offering a free online training and networking to selected mid-career non-governmental organisational (NGO) and public sector leaders across sub-Saharan Africa. The Academy said the training is intended for mid-career individuals with experience in NGO, non-profit, or public sector roles. Participants,according to it, must be  between 30 and 45 on January 1, 2021. Supported by the United States government, the ACEA provides over 50 hours of virtual coursework and peer discussion in English, French, and Portuguese. Course content will be delivered in partnership with the University of Georgia. Selected participants will receive online instruction and participate in peer discussions organised into three short courses: Principles of Civic Engagement, Political Inclusion, and media Management. Participants will also be exposed to leadership development and strategic planning concepts. All participants will develop a peer-mentored Civic Engagement Action Plan, where they identify steps to bring a civic engagement project to life in their community or government unit. Through these discussions, participants will be able to make new connections and exchange views with peers from across sub-Saharan Africa while they develop their Civic Engagement Action Plan, gaining valuable input into the project they will propose for their own organisation or public sector unit. In the end, about 60 participants will be selected for the African Civic Engagement Summit holding next year, where they will meet, network, and share perspectives on approaches to improved civic engagement in their communities.
