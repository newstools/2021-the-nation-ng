Former Ogun Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel has joined the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC). He served as campaign manager of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate in 2019 Abubakar Atiku. The Nation gathered Daniel will pick up the membership card of APC on Tuesday. In a statement, Daniel apologised to his former party for the short notice, stating that his support for Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, was a pointer. He explained the decision took a speedy curve after request of the national caretaker Chairman of APC to visit him along with three governors. He wrote: “Dear friends & colleagues, pardon my short notice in informing you of my route to the APC which as you might have suspected started with my supporting Governor Dapo Abiodun during the last election. “I have since experienced an avalanche of encouragement to come on board. “However in the last 48 hours things took a dizzying speed with the decision of the APC National Chairman request to visit me at Asoludero on Wednesday with about three Governors. “While planning for the visit Governor Abiodun also decided to visit me later today with another set of Governors later today. “It therefore means that I have finally been ‘captured’ “I thought I should quickly brief the house before the news go viral. Thanks for your understanding OTUNBA GBENGA DANIELS.”
