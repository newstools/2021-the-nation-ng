 Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)   match agent Jairo Pachon said the Festival Women’s Trophy 2021 in Antalya in Turkey is  a good test for the Super Falcons  as American coach Randy Waldrum opens his account with  the Africa’s women champions  today. The tournament will be held between February 17 and 23  the Super Falcons  playing the first of their three matches   today  against   CSKA Moscow .Nigeria will then take on Uzbekistan on Saturday as well as Equatorial Guinea next Tuesday before heading back home. Meanwhile, the CEO of Eurodata Sports who mid-wived  the tournament along with MC Sport  agency said  the Super Falcons would   enjoy maximum benefits  despite the fact that there is no prize money attached  to the competition. “It is important to support not just the Super Eagles but also Super Falcons and all  the youth teams whenever possible, our commitment is not with one team but with the continuous growth of Nigerian football and this can be only possible if we support all levels at women, men’s and youth,” Pachon who is in Turkey told NationSport. “ It is a good way for the new coach to begin his mandate with the Super Falcons  and also a good opportunity for  the players to  get together  after a long lay-off without international matches.” In a  related development, Pachon said Eurodata Sports are working round the clock  to put together  quality matches  for  the local-based  Super Eagles Team B that failed to  qualify for the CHAN Tournament recently concluded in Cameroon. “ Of course, we  are also looking  for opportunities for the home-based  Super Eagles to play internationally so that the   Super Eagles coach (Gernot Rohr) as well as  the Chan Team coach can evaluate  the players especially now that the NPFL  is back,” posited Pachon.
