The National Industrial Court has ruled in favour of Prof. Charles Inyangete, the former Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Nigeria Mortgage Refinancing Company (NMRC) who was unceremoniously removed from office. Inyangete was removed from office in 2017 by the board with about two years left in his employment contract. He approached the court to challenge his removal and after about two years of legal war, Inyangete who was represented by Mr. Solomon Umoh, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) got judgement in his favour. The case which had been on for about two years was between the Claimant, Prof. Inyangete and the defendants NMRC and Dr. Charles Okeahalam. Inyangete joined the company in November 2014, on a five years contract following the incorporation of NMRC as a key component of the Nigeria Housing Finance Programme (NHFP) funded under a US$300 million IDA Facility from the World Bank Group. His appointment was however wrongfully terminated by the current Board of NMRC after about three years and five months. The Piooner NMRC bossâ€™s tenure was expected to expire on December 2019. Ruling on the case on 22nd February 2021, the National Industrial Court sitting in Abuja and presided over by Hon. Justice O.O Oyewunmi after listening to arguments from both counsels, Umoh for the Claimant and Oyebode and Aluko for the defendants, ruled that the board was wrong in its entirety in removing Inyangete from office. Oyewunmi who vindicated Inyangete of any wrong doing also ordered the Board to grant him all his entitlement up to the end of his contract of employment.
