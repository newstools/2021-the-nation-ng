Eko Club has mourned the death of the first civilian Governor of Lagos State, Alhaja Lateef Kayode Jakande. In a statement signed by the President of the club, Dr. Shamsudeen Ade Dosunmu, the club commiserated with the government and people of Lagos State on “this huge loss.” It urged them to take solace in the exemplary life of service to humanity and uncommon achievements of Pa Jakande in office. He prayed that God Almighty will rest his soul and grant him Aljanah Firdaus and further prayed to God to grant his immediate and extended family the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss. The club has inaugurated an ultra-modern swimming pool and inducted 44 members, who have newly joined it. Dosunmu said the swimming pool was financed by the Asoju Oba of Lagos, Sir. Kensington Adebutu. Adebutu, represented at the event by another strong pillar of social clubs in Lagos, Aare Kola Oyefeso, expressed the appreciation of Sir Kessington to be at the event, but could not meet up due to personal reasons. He congratulated members for the success of the club since its inception and for witnessing the completion of the swimming pool, which was named Kessington Adebutu Pools and Gardens.
