 Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr may have foreclosed the possibility of inviting any player from the domestic league for next month’s 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho. Though many football faithful have long been canvassing for the inclusion of home-based players  in the Super Eagles ,  Rohr has consistently maintained that there  is a  gulf between players in the domestic league and their counterparts in Europe. Fresh from watching the CAF Confederation Cup match between Rivers United and Enyimba in Port Harcourt on Sunday, the vastly experienced German said he was unable to identify any player to fit into the current Super Eagles set up. “It was an interesting match; two teams very close to each other,” the 67-year-old said of  the dramatic game that ended in a 5-4 penalty shoot-out win for Enyimba. Yet the former Bordeaux coach stated further that some of the players on both sides at best can feature for the Super Eagles B Team, adding he did not see any that can displace his legion of overseas stars. He said: “The CHAN team should be the step to come up (for the players) before the A -team. I didn’t see today (Sunday) somebody who is better than the European professionals we have.” Rohr, in the meantime, said only the best and fittest of players would be picked for the forthcoming games in March, adding he has spoken with  injured  Napoli striker  Victor Osimhen  after he collapsed  during a Serie A game against Atalanta on Sunday. “ I spoke with him (Osimhen). He is okay.”
