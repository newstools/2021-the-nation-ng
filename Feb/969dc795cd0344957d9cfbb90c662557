A 40-year-old suspected ritualist, Mr. Adeboye Moshood, was on Tuesday arrested with human parts by a Joint Task Force (JTF). It was gathered that Moshood on Tuesda morning brought home a sack that contained what was not known to his neighbours. He lives at Gbayarin, near Ayepe market, Gbongan, in Ayedaade Local Government of Osun State.  The Nation learnt that when he entered the house, an offensive odour filled the air, raising suspicion. It was gathered that he was challenged by some of his neighbours, but he refused to answer them. He instead took the sack away from the house and hid it in a nearby bush. But his neighbours reported the matter to the JTF officials in the area. They discovered the sack where he hid it, found human parts inside and arrested the suspect. Moshood was later paraded at the Osun State Police Command, Osogbo with the human parts. Speaking to reporters, the suspect said: “I went to Modakeke on Monday and while I was returning, I stopped at Iwaro when I saw a body on the road. I reasoned that some parts would be useful for me. Then I cut them out for money ritual.” Police Commissioner Mr. Olokode Olawale said he would make Osun State uninhabitable for criminals. Other suspects paraded are four workers of a company, Oyebajo Sunday, 20; Oludokun Damola, 27; Olaniyi Hakeem, 29; and Chimeze Umeh, 38, who were arrested for conspiracy and stealing a truck loaded with 20 water pipes worth N3.5millon on February 7, belonging to Thomas Chase Company, Ilesa, Osun State.
