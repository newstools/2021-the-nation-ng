No fewer than 200 persons have been arrested and fined in Kano State by the COVID-19 marshals for violating the virus’ safety protocols. Also, 43 violators of COVID-19 guidelines were arraigned on Monday in a mobile court in Abuja. The state government said the arrest, punishment and fine have become necessary because non-compliance to safety protocols has been identified as a big challenge to curbing the spread of the virus in the state. A statement by the Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, said 102 residents who were caught violating the protocols were all fined N5,000 each. About 25 others were remanded in prison by the 21 Mobile Courts set up purposely to deal with violators. “Despite the new wave of COVID-19, which is tougher than the first wave of the pandemic, Kano residents are refusing to observe the infection, prevention and control (IPC) protocols. “The enforcement measure, therefore, becomes necessary to preserve public safety and ensure full compliance with the Coronavirus prevention protocols, particularly the use of face mask,” he said. The Abuja offenders, who were earlier arrested from different parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) by the Taskforce on Enforcement of COVID-19 Guidelines, were arraigned before a mobile court sitting at the Eagle Square, Abuja. The trial magistrate, Idayat Akani, summarily charged the accused for gross violation of the “Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Health Protection Regulation, 2021”, which was signed on January 26, 2021 by President Muhammadu Buhari.  Educating the violators about the regulation and proper use of facemasks, Magistrate Akani advised them not to leave their nose out of the facemasks, hang it around their chin or put it inside their pockets.
