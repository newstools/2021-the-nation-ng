Five members of the Kwara All Progressives Congress (APC) loyal to the former chairman in the state Hon Bashir Bolairnwa sustained various degrees of injuries at the mayhem that disrupted the APC stakeholders parley, it was gathered. The stakeholders meeting was called by the Senator John Danboyi-led Registration Committee last Wednesday. Shortly before commencement of the meeting, pandemomiun broke out between pro -Governor AbdulRaman Abdulrazaq and pro -Bolairnwa tendencies, leading to a free for all and throwing of chairs. The mayhem was a culmination of the lingering crisis of attrition among the various political tendencies that make up the party. Speaking with our correspondent, Bolairnwa said all the injured party executives and members are receiving treatment on undisclosed hospitals in Ilorin Metropolis. Said he: “Today, I led members of the Kwara APC Caretaker Committee to the residences of some of our members who were assaulted by hoodlums at Kwara State Banquet Hall the venue of the APC Stakeholders parley organised by the Sen. John Danboyi-led APC membership registration/revalidation committee. “Among those visited include, Alhaji Dantala Yaro, the State Treasurer; Barr. Wahab Adeshina, a member of the board of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA); Mallam Lai Karatu, a Youths Leader; Alhaja Sidi Gidado, biological mother to our State Women Leader; Mr Salihu Elepo, Ilorin East LGA Secretary. “These are known and respected stakeholders of the party in Kwara state. They were at the event on the formal invitations of the Registration Committee. Unfortunately, all these did not prevent the attacks on them. “I extended the sympathies of the party to them all. I implored them to see their travails as sacrifices for democracy. I charged them to remain law abiding despite the unprovoked attacks. “I am happy that they were all upbeat and reacting to treatment.”
