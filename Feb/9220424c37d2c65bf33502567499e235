 D’Tigress coach Otis Hughley Jr said Nigeria will not be overawed by America when both teams clash in Group B opener on July 27 at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. At the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup 2018 Quarter-Finals, USA made light work of Nigeria dismissing them 71-40, but at the FIBA Women’s Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belgrade, Serbia in February last year, D’Tigress made amends and almost surprised the USA who closed the gap in the evening of the game to win 76-71. However, Hughley is cautious amidst a yearning to do their best at the big stage. “There is not a lot of time since it is only a few days. When other countries practice this summer, they practice and play because in the first window in November, they are playing and practicing and then the second window, they will have friendly games in the spring and then they will play EuroBasket in June. That is five times before we even get a chance to meet twice. So, it is not enough time to prepare but we shall do our best,” he told FIBA.com. Nigeria will be playing at the Summer Olympics for the second time since their debut at Athens 2004, however, a lot has changed since their inaugural participation. D’Tigress have gone unbeaten in Africa since they won the third place playoff at the FIBA Women’s AfroBasket 2015 in Cameroon to completely dominate the continent winning two back-to-back titles while establishing themselves as a rising force. “Playing USA for the third time in almost as many years is exciting but very, very difficult and we won’t be able to surprise them. They will be ready like they will for everyone else. The USA expects to win every game that they play. We have now adapted that attitude as well. We are going to do our very best and to be the best versions of ourselves. We are excited about that for sure,” the coach added.
