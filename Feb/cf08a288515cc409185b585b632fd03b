Gunmen in the early hours of Monday invaded two villages in Kwall District of Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State and killed four youths. National President of the Irigwe Development Association (IDA) Mr Robbert Ashi, who confirmed the incident, said three young persons were ambushed by suspected herdsmen and killed between Jebbu Bassa and Rikwechongu village on Sunday evening. Another person, he said, was killed at Zirshe village on Monday morning and some houses burnt, including food barns. According to him: “Yesterday night I was informed of attacks by suspected herdsmen who ambushed and killed three of our youth returning back from Jebbu Bassa to Rikwechongu village close to the School of Accountancy. “While at the early hours of this morning (Monday) the herdsmen also attacked Zirshe village and killed one person, burnt several houses including food barns where the villagers had kept their recently harvested produce. This action is condemnable coming at the time our people are preaching peace in the land,” he said. Ashi described the attacks as unfortunate and called on the security agencies to arrest the attackers whom he said are suspected herdsmen Senator Istifanus Gyang said he is saddened and grieved by the attacks on Rikwechongu and Zirshe villages of Irigwe Chiefdom, Bassa LGC. His Special Assistant Media and Protocol, Musa Ashoms, said the Senator noted with concern and dismay that while all effort is focussed on rebuilding peace and reconciling people of Plateau North, there were still persons whose preoccupation is violence and bloodletting. Gyang urged government and the security agencies to secure and protect law abiding citizens and communities of Plateau North and bring the culprits to justice.
