 Budding singer, David ‘Daviskil’ Ajakaiye, has urged youths in Nigeria to eschew all forms of violence or activities that can cause chaos. On Wednesday, January 27, Daviskil appealed while condemning the murder of Ajituewunmeshe Emah on Tuesday, January 19, 2021, by yet to be identified armed men in Edo State. The Brazil-based music act used the opportunity to advise the youths to shun all differences, violence and unite for the development of Igarra in Edo state. “Youths should shun all forms of violence and chaos and embrace peace because that is the only way development can be attracted to the town.” Daviskil also called on the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki and the Igarra monarch, Royal Highness, Oba Emmanuel Adeche Saiki II, JP, Oshinoyi Ariwo Ovejijo, the Otaru of Igarra, and other family heads to preach peace and ensure the people coexist.   “I’m particularly saddened with the death of Lambo because that happened in my state, Edo. As a Kukuruku boy, I frown at that completely. I am calling on His excellency Governor Godwin Obaseki to look into this matter and conduct investigations and bring justice to the deceased.”
