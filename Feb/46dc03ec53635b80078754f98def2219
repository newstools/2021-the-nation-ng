Crisis is brewing between Lagos State traditional rulers and the House of Assembly over the controversial Delineation Bill initiated to move Eti-Osa sub-zero from Lagos Division to Epe. The Oniru of Iruland, Oba Gbolahan Lawal; Ojomu of Ajiranland, Oba Tijani Akinloye and eminent politicians and community leaders have opposed the obnoxious delineation, warning that it could create confusion. They said the five administrative divisions were premised on many factors, which could not warrant their readjustment. Rising from a stakeholdersâ€™ meeting at the Eti-Osa Council headquarters, they said any attempt to take them from their ancestral Lagos Island Division to Epe Division would be resisted. The two lawmakers representing Etiosa Constituency 1 and 2, Noheem Adams and Olusegun Yishawu, who also spoke at the meeting, said they did not sponsor the bill. They said they knew nothing about its source.
