The leadership of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has asked the Federal Government to declare kidnappers as terrorists and treat them in the same manner. NANS President, Comrade Sunday Asefon, condemned the incessant invasion and abduction of students and teachers in the country. Asefon, in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said the abduction of 317 schoolgirls of Government Girls Junior Secondary Jangebe, Talata-Mafara Local Government Area of Zamfara State, was an indictment of the failure of the nation’s security apparatus to withstand the threat of terrorists invading the schools to bully and kidnap school children for ransom. He called on the Federal Government to convene a National Security Summit towards galvanising best brains in providing ideas and innovation for combating the multi-faceted security challenges in Nigeria. “This has become one case too many and the fact that this kidnap happens without any form of opposition from the security apparatus calls for serious concern,” he said. “The event of recent time has made it expedient for the government to change its approach to the scourge of school kidnap especially in the North, it is therefore imperative for the kidnappers to be declared as terrorists and treated as such. “NANS under my leadership will not just fold our arms while these enemies of the nation are allowed to shatter the very fabrics of our educational system and make our schools a no-go area. “It is therefore in our mutual interest to realistically design a new approach to fighting this coward terrorism against our very vulnerable school kids,” he said. The NANS President called on the government at all levels to ensure that there is no repeat of this ugly occurrence anywhere near the schools.
