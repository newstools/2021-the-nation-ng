Rivers chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has explained it has not started the nationwide membership revalidation because officials for the exercise are undergoing training. Rivers APC spokesperson, Ogbonna Nwuke, however, said the training had been concluded to give way for the field operation. He said a delegation from the national level of the party conducted the training to teach officials the modalities for the revalidation. Nwuke said already all the materials required for the revalidation had been moved to the state adding that party members were ready for the exercise. He said: “The exercise will commence any moment from now. We could not start because those to be deployed in the field were undergoing training. They have now completed their training. “They were trained by party officials from the national level. We have all the materials for the exercise and party members are eagerly waiting for it,” he said. It was gathered that a member representing Tai-Eleme-Oyigbo Federal Constituency in the National Assembly Chisom Promise Dike donated N500, 000 to support the revalidation in his constituency. Dike reportedly made the donation during a party stakeholders’ meeting at the APC Secretariat, Afam Oyigbo, ahead of the exercise. He reportedly called on other leaders to support the process and make it hitch-free.
