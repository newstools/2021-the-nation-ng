Committed to boosting local milk production in Nigeria, the Ikun Dairy Farm Limited, a joint venture between Promasidor Nigeria Limited and the Ekiti State Government, has taken delivery of the first batch of pregnant Jersey cows from the United States. This is part of a minimum pre-ordered pool of over 500 heifers, which will now add to the biological pool of 192 indigenous and cross breeds available on the farm. Promasidor Nigeria, a leading food manufacturing company in Nigeria, entered into partnership with the Ekiti State Government to float Ikun Dairy Farm Limited with the support of the Central Bank of Nigeria. All the parties are frantically working to ensure that more of these breed of cows arrive Nigeria in the next few weeks, with the objective of making the dairy farm a model of backward integration in the sourcing and use of local raw materials for milk production. Promasidor Nigeria’s Director External Relations, Mr Andrew Enahoro said that despite logistic challenges bothering in airlifting, the delivery of all the 500 Jersey breed cows was on course. Current milk production from the animals on Ikun Dairy Farm is being utilised by the calves, as the farm tries to ramp up volumes in preparation for processing. Meanwhile, Promasidor Nigeria has also embarked on the adoption of out growers for milk collection as supplement to Ikun Dairy Farm’s direct milk production. Ikun Dairy Farm Limited was incorporated on 22nd January, 2020 as an integrated agro-allied concern. It is an initiative of Promasidor Nigeria and the Ekiti State Government through its Investment company, Fountain Holdings Limited with the former holding majority shares in the company.
