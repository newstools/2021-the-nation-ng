The Department of State Services (DSS) has reiterated its alert about plans by some elements working to incite ethnic and religious violence across the country. Public Relations Officer, DSS National Headquarters, Abuja, Dr Peter Afunanya, said latest developments indicate desperate efforts by these groups to subvert public order. He warned such elements should desist or face the wrath of the law and assured they will take necessary steps to ensure the safety of lives and property of the citizenry. Afunanya, in a statement on Wednesday, said,: “The Department of State Services (DSS) hereby reminds the public of its earlier warnings about plans by persons and groups to exploit some fault lines to cause ethno-religious violence in parts of the country. “Latest developments indicate desperate efforts by these groups to subvert public order. In this regard, they have continued to resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements and acts. The objective is to pit citizens against one another in order to apparently inflame the embers of tribal and religious discords. “For the umpteenth time, the Service strongly warns these elements to desist forthwith from their (planned) nefarious acts or face the full wraths of the law. However, the DSS will, in collaboration with other security and law enforcement agencies, take necessary steps to ensure the safety of lives and property of the citizenry. ” The Service had on January 11, 2021, raised alert over plans by some persons, working with external forces to incite religious violence across the country. The Service had said targeted States include Sokoto, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Rivers, Oyo, Lagos and those in the South East.
