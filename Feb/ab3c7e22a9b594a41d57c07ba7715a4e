Our Reporter Liverpool defender Joel Matip will miss the remainder of the 2020-21 season due to an ankle ligament injury. Matip suffered the injury in a challenge with Heung-Min Son during Liverpool’s victory over Tottenham on Thursday and was subsequently substituted at half-time. With fellow centre backs Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez also out with long-term injuries, Liverpool signed defenders Ben Davies from Preston and Ozan Kabak from Schalke on Monday just hours before the transfer window closed. “Unfortunately, we found out now after everybody looked at it that Joel will be out for the rest of the season,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told Liverpoolfc.com. Matip has made just 12 appearances for Liverpool this season “But he will be ready for the start of the next pre-season and finally everything will be sorted.” Captain Jordan Henderson and fellow midfielder Fabinho have deputised at centre back in recent weeks, with youngsters Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams also filling in. However, with a hectic schedule ahead as Liverpool continue their Premier League title defence and resume their Champions League campaign, Klopp has been provided with reinforcements.
