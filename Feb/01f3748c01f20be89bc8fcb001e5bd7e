The Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, formerly known as Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, on Tuesday declared President Muhammadu Buhari has disappointed Nigeria with his handling of the nation’s affairs. He said the expectations of Nigerians have not been met by the current administration. Bakare spoke during a virtual interview by Dele Momodu, monitored by The Nation. The cleric said there is a general feeling of disappointment among Nigerians who expected change. He bemoaned the lack of leadership, especially with the rising cases of kidnappings and killings, causing non-state actors to take law into their hands. According to Bakare: “We are praying hard that the county will survive and become strong again, this is not what we all call the Nigeria of our dreams “Nigeria will survive and will become the Nigeria of our dreams but right now, things are not together, especially with the drum of disintegration which is louder than before. “Nigeria is better together, if we go back together to the basics of how we came together, looking at 1960 and 1963, we can still be together. We are not there yet, but we are getting closer.” He added: “The truth of the matter is it is still the same Buhari, in the midst of many competing interests, we respond differently. The President is still himself, some have even asked me if he is not somebody else. “Power changes people, has power changed him or is he making the best situation of the circumstances? He will be the one to answer it “The expectations of Nigerians, including everyone who woke up to say we need a breath of fresh air, has not been met. There is a feeling of disappointment. “Citizens have right to demand for good governance. People deserve the government they get.” Citing a biblical illustration, he said: “We rejected PDP and embraced APC’s change but it appears we have been shortchanged.”
