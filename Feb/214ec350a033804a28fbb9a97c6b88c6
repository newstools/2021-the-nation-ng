 The backlash against Abdulkadir Adekunle Akinlade in the wake of his defection from the ruling the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State,  to the Allied Progressives Movement (APM) in 2018 was swift; resulting in unprecedented loss in followership and culminating in his losing the 2019 gubernatorial election to the current governor, Dapo Abiodun, Not a few observers of the politics of the state felt the young politician was misdirected by his godfather and leader, Senator Ibikunle Amosun back then. But rather than retrace his step by accepting the outcome of the election and returning to the APC in good time, Akinlade spent time and money challenging Abiodun’s victory in court. He went all the way to the Supreme Court but lost all the way. Now, he recently rejoined APC. Since his return, tongues have been wagging over his political future. Aside the fact that he has lost popularity and followership within the ruling party, nearly all the structures built for him in APC by Amosun while the later was governor, have been submerged under the incumbent governor’s structures across the state, leaving the returnee Akinlade and his handful of supporters without any political strength within the party. To make matters worse, there is now talk about him being abandoned to fate by Amosun. Sentry gathered that the former governor, who now represents Ogun Central senatorial district at the National Assembly, may have resolved to try another of his associates for the governorship come 2023. With Akinlade also reportedly getting ready to try his luck again in the gubernatorial race, it is uncertain how things will pan out for him in the emerging power intrigues.
