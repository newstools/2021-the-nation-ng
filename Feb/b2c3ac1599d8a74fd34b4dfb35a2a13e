 Beneficiaries of the COVID-19 survival fund have appealed to the Federal Government, through the Bank of Industry (BoI), to grant them repayment extension. They said with the second wave of the pandemic ravaging the country, business had slowed down. Specifically, they want the payment extended from three months to end of the year. They spoke on the sidelines of the stakeholders’ meeting in Abuja at the instance of BoI. The lender convened the meeting with the aim of knowing the extent the fund disbursed had served their businesses and what the government should expect from them. One of the beneficiaries, Orokpo Jessy, who owns Alojessy Global Concept, said the fund was quite helpful during the lock down but appealed to the government to extend the payment as businesses were still not stabilised due to low patronage and second phase of the pandemic. BoI Head, Stakeholders Management, Akan Ekwere who spoke on the occasion, said so far, 64,000 Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) had been verified with 11,000 beneficiaries getting the disbursed fund. Akan said the fund disbursement was designed for three months and not more than that. He also advised beneficiaries to contact BoI programme delivery office with information on staff relief from their organisation since workers are paid directly and not through the company.
