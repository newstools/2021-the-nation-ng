The Ondo State government has approved Prince Adeleke Adegbite-Adedoyin as the new monarch for Ikare Akoko in Akoko North East Local Government Area. The selection of Prince Adegbite-Adedoyin was approved and ratified at Thursdayâ€™s State Executive Council (Exco). Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mrs. Omolola Fagbemi, who announced this in Akure, the state capital, said the selection of Prince Adegbite-Adedoyin was ratified in line with Ikare tradition and law of the state. Mrs. Fagbemi said the prince was unanimously presented to the kingmakers by the only ruling house of Owa-Ale of Ikare Akoko. Prince Adeleke-Adedoyin is a lawyer trained in the United Kingdom (UK) and will be the 18th Owa-Ale of Ikare-Akoko, when crowned. His father, Oba Kolapo Adegbite-Adedoyin, died last September. On behalf of Ikare-Akoko people, the Majeobaje of Ikare Akoko, Chief Saliu Okoja, urged the new monarch to emulate his late father who turned many enemies to friends through selfless services to the humanity. He urged the new Owa Ale-elect to bring everyone together for the development of the town.
