A female operator of Point of Sale (POS) service in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State, identified as Ezinne Grace Iroh has been killed. Iroh was at work at Ukaegbu Road near Ogbor Hill when she was attacked. The hoodlums after dispossessing her of an undisclosed amount of cash, shot her and later shot into the air before fleeing the scene. It was learnt that Iroh lost much blood and was rushed to hospital immediately the gunmen fled the scene. She died hours after the medical staff battled to save her life, it was learnt. Our correspondent gathered that on Thursday, some set of boys wielding dangerous weapons had attacked late Iroh in her business premises, but luck ran out on one of them who was eventually caught and handed over to the Azuka Police Division. “On Thursday, some boys came and attacked her (the female POS operator), but luck ran out on one of them after the lady raised the alarm. “One of the gunmen was apprehended and was nearly lynched by irate youths but was handed over to the Azuka Police Station. “Without anticipating anything, the lady came out the next day (Friday) for business and was killed,” a source said.
