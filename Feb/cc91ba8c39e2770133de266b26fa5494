 SUPER Falcons’ Glory Ogbonna and Chinwendu Ihezuo have urged their teammates to lift their game when Nigeria faces Uzbekistan in the ongoing Turkish Gold Cup in Antalya on Saturday. The Falcons beat CSKA Moscow 1-0 through Chinwendu Ihezuo’s goal and as they trade tackle with Uzbekistan today, Ogbonna said they can only continue with their impressive start if they strive to play better than they did against CSKA Moscow. “I feel great. It is a great honour for me. As a player, I always want to play matches and also give my best so that I am selected. I was elated to make list that started the game. I am very proud of my performance and I can say that I am fit and my recovery rate has improved. I can also make tackles too,” said Ogbonna who was the only home-based that started the game said. “It was a great start knowing that we haven’t been together for a long time. To start with a win is a great thing for us and I hope that in the next match we will get better.” Corroborating, Ihezuo who is presently without a club affirmed that the Super Falcons must do better against Uzbekistan. Super Falcons vice captain, Francesca Ordega, however informed that the objective of the team outing in Turkey is to bond as a team. She said they are not desperate to emerge as the champions.
