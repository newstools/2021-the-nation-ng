Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi has said the only way to stop corruption in the country is to jail those found liable for graft. He said the corruption monster had continued to loom large because thieves had not been jailed or severely punished. The minister, who is also a former Rivers State governor, spoke yesterday while delivering the 2021 Founders’ Lecture at the University of Port (UNIPORT) in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. Amaechi urged the public to stop celebrating those who fraudulently enriched themselves by stealing public funds. The minister noted that such acts encouraged corruption. He insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration was determined to fighting the malaise. The minister, who spoke on the topic: The Role of Transportation in Nation-Building, said the absence of transportation would cripple the nation’s economy. Amaechi said the Federal Government was giving priority attention to the sector because of its importance. The minister said no nation could have an efficient transport system without good sea ports, adding that the Federal Government was targeting the construction of three new seaports across the country. He said the sea ports would be located in Onne, Rivers State; Lekki in Lagos State and Warri in Delta State.
