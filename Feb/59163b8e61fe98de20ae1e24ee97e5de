 The Nigeria Women Football League has fined  Bayelsa Queens of Yenagoa N2.5million and also banished the team to the Dan Anyiam Stadium, Owerri, Imo State for their next home game scheduled for March 3. The Chairperson of the NWFL, Aisha Falode, said yesterday  that; “Bayelsa Queens committed the infringement in the Match No. 41 played against Edo Queens FC of Benin at the Samson Siasia Stadium, Yenagoa, where it was established in the match officials reports that there was an encroachment, disturbances and disruption of the match by the home team fans.” In a related development, the NWFL also slammed a N500,000 fine on Edo Queens FC for the action of the team’s Technical Adviser, Mr. Rolandson Odeh, after the match. Odeh, verbally attacked the referee in a post-match interview after the Match Number 41 game against Bayelsa Queens at the Samson Siasia Stadium, Yenagoa. The NWFL chairperson stressed: “Rolandson Odeh, was accused of making some frivolous and unsubstantiated comments about the centre referee which put the league in question with disregard to the progressive efforts being put in place by the board of the NWFL to restructure the league. “Therefore, Edo Queens FC was fined the sum of five hundred thousand naira (N500,000) for granting such incisive interview capable of bringing the game to disrepute. We believe the fine will serve as a deterrent to Edo Queens FC and also a strong and last warning to Mr. Rolandson Odeh.” Falode added: As Mr. Rolandson Odeh gets a final warning, the same goes to Bayelsa Queens FC which committed similar infractions against Sunshine Queens of Akure in Yenagoa a few years ago and were equally sanctioned. A repeat of such violations would attract a stiffer sanctions.”
