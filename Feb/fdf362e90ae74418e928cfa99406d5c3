Leader of the proscribed Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu Monday disclosed that the organisation’s Eastern Security Network (ESN) will commence the full enforcement of Nigeria’s Anti-Grazing Law in the East in less than two weeks. Kanu, who spoke through the IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Powerful disclosed that in less than two weeks ESN will commence the full enforcement of Nigeria’s Anti-Grazing Law in the East. He said that the organisation was determined to wage war against the herdsmen, adding that nobody has monopoly of violence. “You are about to understand how determined we are. You have the temerity to talk about monopoly of violence? The era of Biafrans crying and lamenting to EU and UN has come and gone. The Dragon Flag has been raised! If you don’t know what it means go and ask. By the time what is about to happen is concluded, you will see Somalia as paradise on earth.” He maintained that there is no going back in implementing the law on grazing in the region. “We won’t tolerate any iota of killer Fulani herdsmen menace in the East.”
