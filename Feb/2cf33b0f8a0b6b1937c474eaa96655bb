There were heavy explosions and a gun duel between Boko Haram insurgents and security operatives in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, on Tuesday. No fewer than 10 people were feared killed in the attack, which left about 47 injured. The insurgents tried to launch an attack on the University of Maiduguri through the northeastern side despite military trenches around the institution. Residents said the attack created tension in Mairi, Kaleri and Constein settlements which share a fence with the university. Another source at the Specialist Hospital in Maiduguri said about 18 people were injured, while those in critical conditions have been transferred to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital. Also on Tuesday, the military said troops have recovered Marte and other adjourning communities in Borno State, which were earlier captured by the Boko Haram terrorists. The Chief of Army Staff, Major General Ibrahim Attahir, had asked the troops to recapture the town within 48 hours. Director of Army Public Relations Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima said: “Troops of Nigerian Army troops this afternoon, around 3 pm, recovered New Marte and adjoining communities from the devilish Boko Haram terrorists. “The troops, backed by air cover from the Nigerian Air Force, successfully charged through Marte town, destroying several Improvised Explosive Device (IEDs) and landmines laced across their routes and killing scores of Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists and successfully recovered the town. “The gallant troops are currently in total control of the general area.”
