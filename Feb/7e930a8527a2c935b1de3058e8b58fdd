Residents of Akure have begun use of the pedestrian bridge along Oba Adeshida road at the Oja-Oba (Oba market) 29 years after it was constructed. The pedestrian bridge was built in 1992 during the administration of late Bamidele Ishole Olumilua. For many years, the bridge was not used because pedestrians could easily cross to either side of the road because the median railings were broken in many parts. Ondo State government had last month begun the replacement of the median iron railings with concrete jerseys from the Post Office to Texaco Filling Station. Some of the residents said they prefer using the pedestrian bridge to walk long distance to cross the road. Ondo Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Mr. Saka Ogunleye said it was part of ways to making Akure a befitting state capital. Ogunleye said it was the final government step to ease traffic flow by putting a stop to crossing the median by making use of the bridge.
