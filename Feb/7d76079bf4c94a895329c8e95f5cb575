The State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State has sentenced one Sodeinye Mbatumukeke to death by hanging for killing a Jumia delivery agent, Chukwuma Eleji. Justice I. P. Chihozie Igwe, in his judgment, said the prosecution team was able to prove their case beyond every reasonable doubt that Mbatumukeke committed the crime. The judge averred that though the convict rejected the confessional and extra-judicial statements he made, it was weighty enough to prove that he murdered the Jumia delivery agent. He also found him guilty of the second count of armed robbery describing the murder of the Jumia delivery agent as unlawful and gruesome. He said the punishment would serve as deterrent to others. But Justice Igwe discharged and acquitted the second defendant Divine Nabe of murder and robbery, saying there were doubts in the evidence provided by the prosecution linking him him to the crimes. Speaking, the lawyer to the convict, Bonaventure Ugwu, faulted judgement saying they would appeal the decision of the lower court. On his part, the Director of Public Prosecution, Ibiene Mbano described the ruling as a welcome development.
