More reasons have emerged on  why members of NKST church Achusa, a suburb of Makurdi sacked their resident pastor and wife from the church premises on Sunday. The Nation investigation revealed that warring church members have accused the embattled pastor (name withheld) of marrying a woman, who had married two men before, and there was no evidence that the woman had a divorce certificate from her previous marriage. The elders are worried that the pastor’s new wife may likely drag the name of the church into disrepute. The Nation further gathered that the church members also alleged that the young pastor did not take elders (Mbatamen as elders are referred to in Tiv) of the church to his traditional marriage ceremony. A member of the church who pleaded anonymity told The Nation that the elders (Mbatamen) of the church were furious with their resident pastor for not carrying them along in his marriage. Even though The Nation learnt that the pastor lost his wife over a year or less ago, the decision to remarry is his private life, the elders were said to have argued that he is under them (Church) so they deserved to make an input. NKST Synod had intervened in the matter for amicable settlement because it was giving the church a bad image. On Sunday, NKST church warring members barred their resident pastor from conducting service. They also locked the gate and prevented some worshippers from attending Sunday service. Attempt to speak with elders of NKST church Achusa failed as they referred our correspondent to NKST Synod in Mkar, Gboko.
