Residents of Alakuko, a Lagos-Ogun border community, have been enveloped in fear following resumed cult violence on Wednesday. Sources said the hoodlums had since carried their violence to Dalemo, Moshalashi and other nearby bus stops in Alakuko where they looted shops and reportedly set a gas station ablaze. A resident who spoke to The Nation alleged that no fewer than two persons were killed though she could not provide names or details of the deceased. “We have not known peace since Wednesday night that this madness started. We heard they are One Million Boys and that they have been engaged in street fight with rival cults. “They have been going about breaking shops and looting items. They even burnt a filling station. The whole place is in chaos. I am just praying this doesn’t become like that of the lockdown period when they moved from house to house robbing people,” she said. Similarly, other residents of the area took to social media to lament about the incident, sending SOS messages to the official accounts of the police and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Police spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi said he was not aware of the violence but will make findings and revert. He was however yet to do so at the time of this report. Meanwhile, Adejobi in a statement said operatives of the Command arrested 27 suspected criminals during raids of black spots in the early hours of Thursday and Friday. He said the arrests were made by the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) following a directive from Police Commissioner, Hakeem Odumosu on sustained anti-crime operations.
