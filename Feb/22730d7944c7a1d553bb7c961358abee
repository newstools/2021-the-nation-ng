Abia Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has approved the resumption of all public and private nursery, primary and secondary schools for the second term of 2020/2021 academic session for Monday, 1st March 2021. A statement by Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Barr. Chris Ezem said that the second term would end on Friday, 7th May 2021. It further added all school heads and proprietors must ensure that COVID-19 guidelines and protocols are strictly observed in their schools. But there are doubts teachers in public schools may not resume classrooms if government fails to pay their salary arrears, which they have been agitating for since January.
