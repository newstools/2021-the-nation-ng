Eleven persons burnt to death on Monday in a ghastly motor accident on the Afikpo/Okigwe Expressway. Eyewitnesses said the driver was speeding and lost control of the vehicle as he approached a bend. The vehicle somersaulted many times before coming to a halt inside the bush. Police spokesperson Loveth Odah confirmed the incident, saying it occurred at Ayaragu in Ivo council area of the state. She said the 18-seater bus belonging to Abia Line Network Company Ltd with about 14 passengers on board had a burst tyre and somersaulted several times before catching fire. “The fire burnt about 11 of the passengers beyond recognition. Three survived, one is in the general hospital Ishiagu while two have been discharged but the driver died on the spot,” she said. Mrs Odah said the vehicle manifest was dated February 7. She said the Commissioner of Police has sent his condolences to the family and called on the public whose brothers and sisters travelled from Umuahia to Abakaliki to move to Ivo general hospital for possible identification of their relatives’ bodies. “This very unfortunate incident takes me back to what I have been telling drivers to always check their vehicles to ensure they are roadworthy,” she said.
