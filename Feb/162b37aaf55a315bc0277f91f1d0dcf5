  The Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN), Lagos State Area Unit, said  the late first civilian governor of Lagos state, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, left unparalleled legacies. Its Amir (president)  Miftahudeen Thanni, described Jakande as a great achiever. Thanni noted that the former Lagos State governor remained the best administrator the state had. According to him, no governor in Lagos has been able to match the achievements of the late Jakande in the educational and housing sectors. He said: “Lagos State and Nigeria, in general, have lost a rare gem. An outstanding personality has been lost. He remains the most educationally-friendly governor. Up till now, his records in the education sector remain unparalleled by others. “The deceased has made landmark achievements that will never be forgotten in the history of the state. Today, his housing policies still remain reference points for successive governments. “He was such an outstanding administrator that his time as a governor remains a yardstick for good governance in the state. “Our advice is that Jakande’s death should be a lesson to all politicians and leaders in the country. “They should be reminded that they will one day be asked to give an account of their deeds. “We pray that Allah forgive his shortcomings and grant him paradise. May his soul rest in perfect peace.” Jakande died in the early hours of Thursday at the age of 91. Jakande, a former journalist was Lagos State Governor from 1979 to 1983, and later served as Minister of Works under the military government of General Sani Abacha. His administration as Lagos State Governor left a legacy of massive infrastructure development during his four-year stint.
