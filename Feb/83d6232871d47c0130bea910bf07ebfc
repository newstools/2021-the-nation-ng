Our attention has been drawn to publications making rounds in the media with claims that a Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered the freezing of bank accounts belonging to Rainoil Limited.  This disclaimer is to publicly state that the news does not represent true facts as it concerns Rainoil Limited.  Rainoil Limited is not indebted to The Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) and as such has not had any of its bank accounts frozen. The company also does not have bad debts with any bank.  Members of the public are therefore advised to disregard the news as Rainoil Limited is not a party to the suit filed by AMCON at the Federal High Court, Lagos.  Rainoil Limited continues to remain a law abiding and fully compliant organization, offering value to its numerous stakeholders and contributing to the growth and development of our nation, Nigeria
