The Justice Yunusa Musa-led three-man Edo State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal in Benin yesterday reserved judgment in the four remaining petitions before it. The panel reserved verdict after the adoption of final written addresses. It said dates would be communicated to the parties. The four petitions were filed by Action Democratic Party (ADP) and its governorship candidate, Iboi Emmanuel; the Action Peoples Party (APP); the governorship candidate of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Tracy Agol, and the Allied Peoples Movement (APM). They are challenging the declaration of Governor Godwin Obaseki as the winner of the September 19, 2020 governorship election. Last December 11, the tribunal, in a unanimous ruling, dismissed the petition by Action Alliance (AA) and its governorship candidate, Ukonga Onaivi, against Obaseki, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for failing to file pre-hearing notice. The petitioners’ counsel urged the tribunal to allow their clients’ petitions and grant the reliefs sought.
