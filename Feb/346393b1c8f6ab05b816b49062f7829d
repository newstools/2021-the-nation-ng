The scheduled arraignment of former Aviation Minister, Senator Stella Oduah and eight others over alleged N10b fraud was stalled on Monday owing the prosecution’s failure to effect service of court documents on some of the defendants. This is the second time the arraignment would be put off in view of claim by lawyer to the prosecuting agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Hassan Liman (SAN) that he was yet to serve all the defendants. The EFCC, in the 25-count charge, marked: FHC/ABJ/CR/316/2020 accused the nine defendants of engaging in conspiracy, money laundering and maintaining anonymous bank accounts with First Bank Plc. Named with Oduah as defendants, are Gloria Odita, Nwosu Emmanuel Nnamdi, Chukwuma Irene Chinyere, Global Offshore and Marine Ltd, Tip Top Global Resources Ltd, Crystal Television Ltd, Sobora International Ltd and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Nigeria Ltd. At the mention of the case on February 9, 2021, Liman told the court that the defendants were absent in court because they were not yet served. On Monday, Oduah and some other defendants were in court, but Liman again told the court that he was yet to serve the fifth and sixth defendants – Global Offshore and Tip Top Global. Liman sought the permission of the court to serve the defendants, which are corporate entities, at their respective addresses. Without any objection from some defence lawyers in court, Justice Inyang Ekwo granted the leave sought and directed that the defendants be served within 14 days. He adjourned till April 19 for arraignment.
