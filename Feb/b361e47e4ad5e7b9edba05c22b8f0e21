 Former youth international  striker  Abddul-Rasheed Kehinde Ayinde over the weekend led  a squad of five players to kick start their professional football career with  Lithuanian League A Lyga side, DFK Dainava. Others on the trip along with Ayinde who starred for the 2015 Class of the  Golden Eaglets  en route to  Nigeria’s record  fifth  FIFA U-17 World Cup title in Chile, included strikers Abimbola Idowu Agunwa Nnamdi Gideon, midfielder Samuel Ogba Francis and  bulky defender Biliaminu Nurudeen Abiola  who trained with the national Under-23 in 2019. The five players are under the auspices of  UK-based OHN Consultancy being managed by Igeola Hassan Nojeem  who explained  that his partnership  with  the Lithuanian League A Lyga side was instrumental to the signing of all the players . “ This is a major breakthrough for us  and I’m happy that these players  were able to fly out of Nigeria to Lithuania  on Sunday,” explained Igeola .“ We have been working on this for sometimes now and we have a perfect  working relationship  with the club’s director, Mr. Rimas Kantaravicius.” According to Igeola,  Dainava  would offer the players  a perfect environment, adding  it would be a great breakthrough to the lads since they are desirous of making names for themselves. “ As you know, Ayinde played in the qualifiers for the coach Emmanuel Amuneke-led Golden Eaglets on their way to World Cup glory in 2015 and was just unlucky to make the final cut,” he said. “ So this is a good opportunity for him and others to show what they can do ; frankly, I don’t have any fear that these boys would do well in Europe.”
