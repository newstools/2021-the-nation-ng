Nigeria can generate 13, 000 megawatts (Mw) of electricity daily by harnessing various energy sources, the Acting Coordinator, Theoretical Physics Programme at the National Mathematical Centre, Dr. Lewis Obagboye, has said. The country’s power generation hovers between 3, 000 and 4, 000 Mw. Obagboye, who spoke during a workshop on renewable energy physics in Abuja on Monday, added that the country has the capacity to generate more by looking into other energy sources. According to him, Nigeria should begin to look at alternative sources of energy if it wants to develop. He said: “The entire world is facing energy issues. Besides the global outlook, Nigeria is a good example that we can take a cue from. We have the potential to generate about 13, 000Mwper day if we look at all the energy sources that we have. “We have so much capacity here on this part of the world. We have abundant sunshine which has the power up to terabyte range but it will amaze you that despite all the potential we have – wind, biomass and solar, what we generate daily is about 4, 000 Mw. “We are far behind what is necessary and everyone can attest to it that it is almost blackout. On the African continent, it is only South Africa that has reached a certain level of potential. “Energy translates to development, so if we want to develop, this aspect of physics has to be looked into, knowing that we have these potential.” Obagboye said the centre is ready to guide students on renewable energy physics. According to him, the goal is to have students thinking about renewable energy physics with the hope that Nigeria can become better in terms of power generation. “Renewable energy is free but harnessing it requires a certain level of knowledge and we have students with that knowledge that are capable of utilising it if we can get it done,”  he added.
