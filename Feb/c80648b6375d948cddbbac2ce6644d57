 German coach Gernot Rohr is not in a hurry to release the Super Eagles’ list for the forthcoming 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Republic of Benin and Lesotho in March. The Super Eagles will be away to The Squirrels of Benin on March 22 while the final match of the qualifier against the Crocodiles of Lesotho takes place at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos. Yet Rohr is still bidding his time before naming the squad for the two crucial ties in March especially with the legion of Super Eagles doing well across Europe. The former Bordeaux coach was coy when pressed about when the Super Eagles list for the double header in March would be ready and our correspondent learnt from the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) that he has yet to submit the list to the federation’s technical department. Meanwhile, Rohr will be off to Delta State tomorrow to witness the grand finale of a youth tournament that would parade a team put together by former Nigeria international striker Victor Agali. Agali happens to be one of Rohr’s most reliable allies since he took charge of the Super Eagles. “Thursday, leave early in the morning for Delta State,” Rohr, who has been in Lagos since the weekend told NationSport. “I will be in Delta to watch academy tournaments, young talents and also Victor Agali’s team. The semi-finals of the tournament is on Thursday and the finals on Saturday,” Rohr said. Still in continuation of its scouting mission of home-based talents for the Super Eagles, the erstwhile coach of Niger, Burkina Faso and Gabon national teams hinted he will also be in the mix in Port Harcourt for the crucial CAF Confederation play-off against two top Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) sides as Rivers United battle Enyimba International FC who ran away with a solitary goal victory on Sunday.
