An Abeokuta High Court on Wednesday sentenced one Ibrahim Toyin, 33, to death by hanging for robbing a woman at gunpoint. Ibrahim was said to have robbed one Titilayo Eniola of her handbag. He pleaded not guilty, but Justice Ayokunle Rotimi-Balogun said that all the evidence tendered had convinced the court that Ibrahim committed the offences as charged. She subsequently sentenced Ibrahim to death by hanging. At the trial, prosecution counsel Mrs Margaret Sodeke had told the court that the convict and others, now at large, conspired and robbed Eniola of her handbag containing valuables. Sodeke explained that while the complainant was coming from her shop at around 10 p.m., the convict with others now at large stopped her and pointed a locally made pistol on her. She explained that the convict collected and carted away with the complainant’s hand bag containing N15,000 cash, ATM card and other valuables. The prosecution counsel said that the convict was arrested by members of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) and on his arrest, he was found with a locally made gun and two live cartridges.
