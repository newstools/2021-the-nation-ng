Robert Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry both scored twice as Bayern Munich strengthened their position at the top of the Bundesliga with victory over Cologne. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting opened the scoring before Lewandowski converted Leon Goretzka’s pass to make it 2-0. Ellyes Skhiri reduced the arrears, but Thomas Muller teed up Lewandowski to restore the hosts’ two-goal cushion. Gnabry scored twice in the final 10 minutes to complete a comfortable win. The victory lifts Bayern five points clear of second-paced RB Leipzig, who face Borussia Monchengladbach later on Saturday. Poland striker Lewandowski has now scored 28 Bundesliga goals this term – nine more than any other player in the division. With 11 league games remaining, the 32-year-old is on target to beat Gerd Muller’s record of 40 goals in a Bundesliga season, set in 1972.
