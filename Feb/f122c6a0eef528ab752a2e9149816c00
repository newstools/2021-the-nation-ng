Members of the NKST Church, Achusa, Makurdi, the Benue State capital, gave their pastor an unexpected Valentine treatment on Sunday. They asked him to vacate his seat and leave the church. The church members, who were reportedly uncomfortable with the pastor’s methods,  also stopped him from conducting Sunday service. Worshippers who turned up for Sunday service were  stranded as they too could get into the church premises. When The Nation visited the church located in a  new layout in Makurdi, worshippers were seen milling around the locked gate. There was some tension as the pastor and his supporters were  adamant, saying he was not going anywhere. NKST is a predominantly Tiv church with its synod headquarters in Mkar, Gboko . The Nation gathered that some members of the church accused the resident pastor of some strange doctrines and want him remove. But under the NKST church rules, only the Synod in Mkar, Gboko can sanction  a resident pastor. Some gunmen on Sunday killed a police officer in a church in Ughelli, Delta State, Police spokesperson Onome Onovwakpoyeya confirmed the development to newsmen in Warri. “Yes, he (police officer) followed his principal (not named) to the church,” she said. An eyewitness said the gunmen allegedly stormed a pentecostal church located in Oviri-Ogor Road, Ughelli in the Ughelli North Local Government Area of the state, during worship service on Sunday and shot the victim three times. The deceased, a police inspector, was said to have been serving at PMF 31, Ogwashi-Uku and was on escort duty at the time of the incident. “The service was abruptly stopped at about 11.15 a.m. when gunshots rang out inside the church premises and worshippers scampered for safety. “It was after the gunmen escaped that some youths summoned up the courage to come out only to discover the police officer in a pool of his blood,” the source said.
