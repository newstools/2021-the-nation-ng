But Sky Sport Italia would later report that the Napoli striker is now alert after regaining consciousness. The 21-year-old striker was said to have hit his head on the turf after a Cristian Romero challenge during the final minute of Napoli’s 4-2 defeat at the Gewiss Stadium in Bergamo. Sky Sport Italia reports Osimhen lost consciousness for a few minutes before he was stretched off. At the beginning, nobody noticed the player’s condition was so severe, but after a few seconds, players urged doctors to enter the pitch. Osimhen was rushed to Bergamo’s Papa Giovanni Hospital accompanied by Napoli’s doctor and is reported to be alert. According to the latest reports from the club, Osimhen was falling in and out of consciousness on the pitch, so was rushed to the nearby ambulance and taken to hospital for tests. The Nigerian has been struggling with a lot of health problems lately, as he dislocated his shoulder on international duty in November, then was diagnosed with COVID-19 in early January.
