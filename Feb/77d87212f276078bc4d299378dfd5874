Police in Kebbi have arrested three suspected arms, spokesman Nafi’u Abubakar said on Monday in a statement. Abubakar added that the command also arrested a notorious kidnapper. One of the suspects Ibrahim Bulus was arrested on January 27 for being in possession of three locally-made double barrel guns and one locally-made single-barrel gun, police said. “When questioned, he could not give any satisfactory account of the guns,” Abubakar said. He said that the suspect confessed that he was contracted by two persons to supply the weapons found in his possession. He said that the two suspects were promptly arrested, adding that they would be charged to court on completion of investigation. One Salihu Liman, 27, allegedly abducted one Salihu Abdullahi, 26, Abubakar said. Troops of Operation Thunder Strike (OPTS) have recovered four AK47 rifles which were part of a stash belonging to the late bandit, Nasiru Kachalla. According to the report, the weapons were recovered with the aid of local human intelligence sources. Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, who confirmed the development in a statement yesterday, said efforts to recover more weapons were in progress. Kachalla was killed late December 2020 during a clash between his gang and a rival group. The clash that led to the death of the suspected notorious bandit, was triggered by a dispute over sharing of a large herd of rustled cattle.
