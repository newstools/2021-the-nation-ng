Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde on Thursday expressed his readiness to convert Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomosho from a university of technology to a conventional university, to enable it offer courses such as Law. Makinde, who made this known while receiving the report of the state negotiation committee on LAUTECH in Ibadan, said the state would soon apply to the National Universities Commission (NUC) for approval of the conversion. He said he had signed the LAUTECH Bill 2020 into law, “so it is now time to move forward with our plan.”
