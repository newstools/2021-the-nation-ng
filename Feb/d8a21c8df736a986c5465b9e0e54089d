Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume has said that Senate Joint Committee on Defence, Army, Navy and Air Force may start the screening of the newly nominated Service Chiefs this week. Ndume disclosed this while answering questions from The Nation in Abuja. Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Wednesday, referred the request of President Muhammadu Buhari seeking the confirmation of the new service chiefs for appointment to the Senate Joint Committees on Defence, Army, Navy and Air Force for further legislative work. Lawan, gave the committees two weeks to carry out their assignments and report back to plenary. The newly nominated Service Chiefs are: Maj. Gen. Lucky Eluonye Onyenuchea lrabor as Chief of Defence Staff; Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru (Chief of Army Staff); Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, (Chief of Naval Staff); and Air Vice Marshal Isiaka O. Amao as Chief of Air staff. They are to replace the former Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Olonisakin; Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen. Tukur Buratai; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ete Ibas and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar. While responding to a question, Ndume said: “It is not advisable to screen service chiefs in the open. “If you do, it means you will be compromising the security of the country especially if there are issues that borders on national security.” He said the Service Chiefs would be screened this week since the joint committee was given only two weeks to submit its report. “We have been given two weeks so it will definitely be done next week and we shall keep you informed,” Ndume said.
