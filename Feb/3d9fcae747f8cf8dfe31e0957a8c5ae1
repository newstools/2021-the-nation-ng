Four persons have been confirmed dead in two accidents that occurred on the Abia section of the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway. Our correspondent gathered while two persons died in an accident at Isiala Ngwa South axis of the ever-busy highway between a Toyota Avalon with registration number Abia SSM 49 BG and a commercial motorcyclist, another two persons died in another accident at the Aro-Ngwa involving an SUV and a commercial motorcyclist another the same highway. Narrating the Isiala Ngwa South incident, an eyewitness, Mr. James Iheanyi said: “I was coming behind the Toyota Avalon carrying a man, a woman and a baby girl. “Just in a twinkle of an eye, the driver of the Avalon veered off the road, killing the okada man and the male passenger as he (car driver) hit them from the back. “You can see the impact of the accident on the Avalon. We only told the man to leave here to go and make entry at the police station so that police can come and evacuate his car and the corpses of the deceased persons from the scene and to avoid being lynched by angry mob.” A road safety official, who spoke anonymously, confirmed the incident at Aro-Ngwa and stated the corpses of the deceased have been deposited at the morgue.
