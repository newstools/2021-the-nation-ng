 Former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olisa Metuh, is not leaving anyone in doubt that he’s a changed man. All through last week, the Anambra State-born politician didn’t stop recounting how his ten month stay behind bars helped him appreciate God more. According to him, he now wants to spend the rest of his life serving God in appreciation of his freedom. Metuh, who earlier told some associates in Abuja stories of how he met God while in prison, attributed his freedom from an incarceration that was meant to keep him locked up for seven years, after ten months, to his faith in God. He said his time in prison was the “lowest” for him. At the weekend, he was in Awka, the Anambra capital for a reception held in his honour. And guess what? He spent ample time again talking about his changed ways. Sentry also gathered that while playing host to some visitors after the event, the PDP chieftain never stopped recalling his new found love for God and all that is godly. According to a source who witnessed a couple of Metuh’s renditions, it appears old things are now passed away for the former PDP spokesperson.
