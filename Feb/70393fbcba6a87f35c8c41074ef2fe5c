 Nigerian equities entered the red zone at the weekend as sustained losses in February eroded the capital gains made so far this year, leaving the average investors with net capital loss of 0.21 per cent. A review of trading in February showed that equities have so far lost an average of 5.25 per cent this month, equivalent to net capital loss of N1.16 trillion so far this month. After losing N663 billion two weeks ago, quoted equities on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) lost N130 billion last week. A running losing streak for three consecutive weeks in February has eroded the net capital gains of N1.13 trillion recorded in January, leaving the market with net capital loss of N31 billion so far in 2021. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks all share prices listed on the NSE, closed weekend down at 40,186.70 points as against its week’s opening index of 40,439.85 points, representing average decline of 0.63 per cent. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also dropped almost correspondingly from its opening value of N21.156 trillion for the week to close weekend down at N21, 026 trillion, representing net depreciation of 0.61 per cent or N130 billion. While equities showed some broad underlying recovery last week, the running negative overall market situation brought the market down to the red zone, implying that investors who had closed January with average positive return of 5.32 per cent, the seventh best return globally according to Bloomberg, has net negative return of 0.21 per cent. Market analysts said the downtrend at the equities market might not be unconnected with the increasing yields in the fixed-income market. At the last bond auction, stop rates rose by an average of 2.54 per cent to 11.10 per cent as against 8.56 per cent at the previous auction. Most analysts, however, remained optimistic about possible recovery at the equities market, citing the impending release of audited results and dividend declarations. “In the new week, we expect the local equities market to close northwards as investors position in stocks with good dividend yields ahead of the release of audited full year 2020 financial results and announcement of corporate actions in the coming weeks,” Cowry Asset Management stated. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities said they expected that “appetite for value stocks would increase in the near term as dividend season approaches”, although there could be “profit-taking activities at the start of the coming week”. Analysts at Cordros Securities stated that increasing release of corporate earnings accompanied by dividend declarations could temper bearish sentiments in the days ahead, although there remains a possibility of continued profit-taking activities due to growing concerns about yield elevation in the fixed income market. “As a result, we think the local bourse will likely exhibit a zig-zag pattern. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated. The ASI had opened 2021 at 40,270.72 points and rallied to 42,416.66 points in the first month. Aggregate market value of quoted equities, which opened 2021 at N21.057 trillion, had rallied to N22.187 trillion by the end of January 2021. Sectoral analysis however showed that the negative overall market position was driven largely by losses recorded within the highly capitalised stocks and the two most influential sectors- banking and industrial goods sectors. The industrial goods sector is the most capitalised sector while banks are the most active and liquid stocks at the Exchange. The NSE Industrial Goods Index showed average year-to-date return of -7.02 per cent at the weekend. The NSE Banking Index has so far this year declined by 3.28 per cent. The NSE 30 Index-which tracks the 30 largest stocks at the NSE, closed weekend with average year-to-date return of -1.68 per cent. The NSE Lotus Islamic Index, which tracks ethical stocks in compliance with Islamic Shari’ah, has declined by 1.46 per cent. Other indices showed considerable returns for the investors. The NSE Insurance Index carries a double-digit average year-to-date return of 12.18 per cent. The NSE Oil and Gas Index has the highest year-to-date return of 16.20 per cent. The NSE Consumer Goods Index closed weekend with average year-to-date return of 1.56 per cent while the NSE Pension Index, which tracks stocks specially screened in line with pension funds investment guidelines, closed with a modest return of 0.38 per cent. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be taking positions in the banking sector as the market awaits the full-year audited results of quoted companies. Three of Nigeria’s largest banks were the most active stocks last week, accounting for more than one-third of the total turnover. Trading in FirstBank Holding Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Zenith Bank Plc accounted for 553.512 million shares worth N8.931 billion in 5,132 deals, contributing 35.92 per cent and 48.98 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. Total turnover stood at 1.541 billion shares worth N18.235 billion in 22,752 deals last week compared with a total of 2.683 billion shares valued at N23.662 billion traded in 27,844 deals two weeks ago. The financial services sector led the activity chart with 1.099 billion shares valued at N11.110 billion in 12,544 deals; thus contributing 71.35 per cent and 60.92 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The consumer goods sector followed with 133.156 million shares worth N2.327 billion in 3,941 deals while the conglomerates sector placed third with a turnover of 121.143 million shares worth N263.219 million in 839 deals. Also, a total of 1.054 million units of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) valued at N7.902 billion were traded in 49 deals last week compared with a total of 1.394 million units valued at N5.163 billion traded in 36 deals two weeks ago.  At the sovereign debt market, a total of 8,613 bond units valued at N12.566 million were traded in two deals last week compared with a total of 46,721 units valued at N60.054 million traded in 19 deals penultimate week. Further share pricing analysis showed that there were 39 advancers and 33 decliners last week as against 16 advancers and 55 decliners recorded in the previous week. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession, Nigerian equities had played the full contrarian to close 2020 with net capital gain of N6.48 trillion. Benchmark indices at the NSE showed average full-year return of 50.03 per cent for the 2020 business year. It was ranked highest in the world. This implied net capital gain of N6.483 trillion. The recent highest return was 42.3 per cent recorded in 2017. The ASI closed 2020 at 40,270.72 points, 50.03 per cent above 26,842.07 points recorded as opening index for the year. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NSE rose to N21.057 trillion by the end of 2020 as against N12.958 trillion recorded as opening value for the year, an increase of N8.1 trillion. The additional increase in value of market capitalisation, above the ASI percentage change, was due to additional or supplementary listing of shares during the year. While a steep decline of 18.75 per cent in March 2020 had driven the first quarter to a negative return of -20.7 per cent or net loss of N2.68 trillion, the market recovered in the second quarter with positive average return of 14.12 per cent or net capital gains of N1.656 trillion. It continued its rally with average return of 9.61 per cent or net capital gains of N1.23 trillion in third quarter 2020. The recovery since 2020 is particularly spectacular when viewed against the background of negative performance in recent years. After posting a world-ranking return of 42.3 per cent in 2017, the market had reversed to negative in 2018 with average full-year return of -17.81 per cent.  In 2019, investors suffered net loss of about N1.71 trillion with negative average return of -14.60 per cent. Prior to 2017, the stock market had been on a losing streak since 2014. Investors lost N1.75 trillion in 2014 and followed this with another loss of N1.63 trillion in 2015. Against the general expectation that political transition and new government will quicken a rebound, equities closed 2016 with a net capital loss of N604 billion.
