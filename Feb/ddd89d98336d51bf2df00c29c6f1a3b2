Nasarawa State Independent Electoral Commission (NASIEC) has postponed the scheduled 27th February 2021 LG election in the state. The commission proposed April or May this year as the new date for the council election. Chairman of the Commission Barr. Ayuba Wandai revealed this Wednesday after meeting with the state leadership of the Inter-Party Advisory Council in Lafia. Wandai gave the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, logistics and administrative challenges as major reasons for the postponement. The state chairman of the Inter-party Advisory Council, Mr Cletus Ogah appreciated NASIEC boss for the steps taken but insisted that the council will not accept a caretaker committee to oversee the affairs of the LGs in the state. Commenting on the council election, Governor Sule said he will not interfere in the election. He dismissed insinuations that he is backing one candidate or the other, stressing that it is not in his style to impose a candidate on the people. According to the Governor, only popular candidates that are chosen by the people in any election will make the APC more acceptable to the people. He appealed to the people to elect only candidates that have the potential to solve issues bothering the people at the grassroots and not those who will only fold their arms while awaiting monthly subvention.
