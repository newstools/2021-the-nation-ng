To ensure that turf is good enough for Super Eagles when they host Lesotho in the last group match of the 2021 AFCON qualifiers, Coach Gernot Rohr is planning to inspect the both the Teslim Balogun Stadium and the National Stadium in Lagos. The coach who has been in Abuja since the weekend is expected to name the squad that will prosecute the final two matches of AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho next month had inspected the Abuja Stadium which he said was not good enough for football. The coach told NationSport that there is still a lot of work to be done on the Abuja stadium. “Abuja is very hot and apparently the stadium is not good for football as there is still a lot of work to do in Abuja. I will inspect Lagos in the coming days,” Rohr said. The match against Lesotho has been fixed for March 30, 2021 while Nigeria won the first leg in Lesotho in 2019. This will be the first time in many years that the Eagles have played in the country’s commercial capital city as the National Stadium in Surulere, Lagos, has undergone a major refurbishment after many years of neglect. The German tactician however, admitted selection headache considering the present form of most of the players in Europe.
