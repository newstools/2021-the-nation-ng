The lawmaker representing Osogbo/Olorunda/Irepodun/Orolu Federal Constituency of Osun State, Olubukola Oyewo, has hailed the Governor Adegboyega Oyetola administration for planning to build an intersection flyover at Olaiya junction in Osogbo. The federal legislator called ‘Bukoy’ by his admirers, described the decision as a product of a very deep thinking and proactive approach to governance by Governor Oyetola, “who doesn’t want to wait until the traffic situation in the area becomes chaotic.” He said besides easing traffic jam at Olaiya junction, the flyover’s positive effect would also be felt in other parts of Osogbo, adding that it would add to the aesthetic value of the state.
