Senate Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu has assured members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, will join the ruling party soon. Kalu gave the assurance while addressing journalists after Wike had led him on a project inspection around Port Harcourt, the State capital on Thursday. Some of the projects inspected were Rumuokoro Flyover bridge, 2nd Artillery Flyover Bridge, Real Madrid football Academy and the Mother and Child Hospital in Rumuomasi. Kalu, who commended Wike for his investments in critical infrastructure, called on him to work harmoniously with the APC. He [Wike] is a man needed by us in the APC, it is my belief that a messiah can come from anywhere. “I urge the Governor to partner with the APC, I discussed with him all through the night to find a common ground with the APC. I believe that very soon it shall come to reality. “So I urge Governor Wike to soft pedal on our party, humans can switch from one party to another which is human behavior in Africa. I appeal to him to partner with us so that the good people of Rivers can benefit more from the Federal Government of Nigeria,” he said.
