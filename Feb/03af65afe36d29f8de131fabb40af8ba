The Lagos Police Command has arrested two suspected cultists, Tunde Rosanye, 39, and MuyideenÂ  Ayede, 20, for their alleged involvement in the violence that broke out at Ebute Metta. Hoodlums on Wednesday morning went on rampage at Herbert Marcaulay and Ondo Street areas of Ebute Metta, attacking, robbing people and vandalising properties. The Nation reports the incident occurred after about two weeks of peace in the neighbourhood notorious for cult related violence. It was however unclear if the attack was connected to gang wars in nearby Lagos Island which have persisted for several weeks. According to the police, normalcy had since been restored in Ebute Metta following the deployment of security reinforcement. Spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, in a statement on Wednesday night, said a locally-made short gun, some live and expended cartridges, two cutlasses, three knives, a mobile phone and one small bag were recovered from the suspects. He said they have given useful information to the police and efforts were on to arrest other fleeing members of the gang. Adejobi said the Police Commissioner (CP) Hakeem Odumosu, assured residents of the commitment of all law enforcement agencies to tackle crime and criminality in the State especially cultism. He said the CP also directed the transfer of the case to State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti, Yaba, for proper investigation, while efforts are intensified to fish out other culprits.
