Police in Delta State have arrested a grandmother and a butcher reportedly linked to a gunrunning syndicate, Police Commissioner Ari Mohammed said at the weekend in Asaba, the state capital. He said his men arrested Garuba Sani, a butcher at Oghara Cattle Market for illegal possession of ammunition late last year. He said the suspect was arrested after a sack he was carrying spilled in an auto crash in December, 2020. He said the suspect confessed that he received the ammunition from 67-year-old Roseline Abeju with alleged ties to a suspected gunrunner, now at large. Abeju, a grandmother, said she was attracted to the trade as a means of surviving widowhood. In a related development, Ari said the police was investigating the publisher of a viral video from Warri which led to the destruction of police facilities in the area.
