The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has stated that with deliberate policies of the government through incentives, the real sector will become more viable than trading. The Chairman of MAN, Apapa Branch, Engr Frank Onyebu, who gave this charge during an interview with The Nation, explained that entrepreneurs would only invest in an economy where they are sure of getting maximum returns on investment in the short-term. Onyebu said, “The real sector of the economy can be revived by a deliberate policy of government through incentives to make the sector more viable than trading. Entrepreneurs would usually invest in businesses where they can get the maximum returns within the shortest possible time. Therefore if enough incentives are provided, investors will move in in droves to exploit the opportunities provided. The government should also make business environment friendly enough to attract even foreign investors into the sector.” The MAN Chairman noted that agriculture is another sector that needs reviving, lamenting that it’s a shame that Nigerians have not exploited even 10 percent of the opportunities in the agricultural sector. “It’s upsetting when you travel along our highways and find stretches upon stretches of fallow lands which could easily be turned into farmlands. It’s even more upsetting when you realise that the individuals who should be ploughing these lands are wasting in our cities looking for non-existent white-collar jobs, “Onyebu stressed.
