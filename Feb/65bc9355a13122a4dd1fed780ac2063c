 A total of 140 indigent students of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State have benefited from the scholarship awards of the Emeka Agbanari Foundation. The beneficiaries, selected from various faculties in the institution by a special committee of the Students Union Government (SUG) received the sum of N7million. Presenting the scholarship to the students, Chairman of SEAMAN Group of Companies, Emeka Agbanari said the gesture was to ameliorate the plight of the students occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. He said: “I have been committed to supporting the indigents because of the covenant I have with God to be of immense blessing to humanity. “I was prompted by the SUG President, Comrade Samuel Jude to assist the students because of the importance he attached to education.” Agbanari, while acknowledging the challenge of unemployment in the country, urged the beneficiaries to identify relevant skills to augment their knowledge to guarantee their employment upon graduation. He praised the university authority on the rapid developments in the institution, assuring of his continued support. Responding, Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Charles Esimone praised the benefactor for ‘towing the path of honour’, just as he praised the students’ leadership efforts in attracting the award. He urged the beneficiaries to count themselves privileged and study hard to justify the financial aid. Also speaking, Dean of Students Affairs, Prof. Nonso Achebe expressed gratitude to the foundation for the timely succour to the students. On his part, SUG President, Jude, appreciated the benefactor for accepting the Union’s request to support the students even at the shortest notice, praying for God’s continuous blessings on him.
