 IT’S true that the joyous ceremony was held last month, but who wouldn’t still be happy? The First Lady of Kebbi State, Dr. Zainab Bagudu, handed her daughter Aisha Shinkafi Saidu’s hand out in marriage in January to former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole, who divorced his ex-wife in 2017. The event was a success but the memory is still so fresh for Mrs Bagudu. Ever since it was held, there’s hardly been a day when the stunning First Lady would not upload one of her daughter’s wedding photos on her WhatsApp status. As one who spreads love and happiness, celebrating the big moment in the life of her daughter and her life as a mother comes naturally. Mrs. Bagudu is a pediatric consultant, a loud voice in the fight against cancer and a child’s rights advocate. As the First Lady, she has become a role model in the state and beyond. Her advocacy for women, children and the youth in Kebbi and across Northern Nigeria touches health, education and skills acquisition.
