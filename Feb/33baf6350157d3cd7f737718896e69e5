Millions of phone users on the Glo network have an opportunity to enjoy generous free data with their loved ones during the Valentine season as the company on Tuesday unveiled a promotion to commemorate the love season. The Glo Valentine Season promotion offers subscribers up to 36GB of free data when they buy two smartphones from the company’s Glo World shops. In the promo, which began on February 8 and is expected to end on February 22, the free data ranges from 3GB to 36GB, with the data slabs being determined by the particular handset the subscriber purchases. Globacom explained this in a statement in Lagos. The company said the free data will be spread over six months for the subscribers’ enjoyment. It added that phone models, such as iPhones, Samsung, Nokia, Infinix, Tecno, Vivo, Imose and Itel, are available for the promo. “The subscriber is rest assured of the genuineness of the phones which come with warranties and after sales support from the manufacturers. The prices at the Gloworld outlets are also the most competitive in the market,” the grand masters of data announced in the statement. Globacom added: “This offer is our way of adding flavour to our customers’ Valentine Season enjoyment. We expect that our customers will be engaged in a lot of online activities before and around February 14. So, we decided to make it easier for them to buy genuine devices at affordable prices for themselves and their loved ones. “They will also use the free data bundles accruing from the promo to reach their loved ones to express their feelings of love and commitment.”
