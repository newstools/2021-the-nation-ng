Leader of the three repentant bandits, Amadu Katare, said they made the decision to embrace the peace process as a result of the way and manner the Governor is handling the process with total sincerity and commitment. . Katare explained he was forced to join banditry following the extra judicial killing of his parents, children and wives by the local vigilante. He appealed to governments to protect the lives and properties of the Fulani because they are being killed innocently on daily basis in the forests.
