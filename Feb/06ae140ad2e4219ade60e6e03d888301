Napoli eased the pressure on boss Gennaro Gattuso as they beat Juventus to halt the Serie A champions’ revival. Juventus captain Giorgio Chiellini had a game to forget in his 400th Serie A appearance as he handled the ball to give away the game’s only goal, with Lorenzo Insigne scoring the penalty. Alvaro Morata had a potential equaliser disallowed as Chiellini was offside. Napoli keeper Alex Meret had an excellent game to deny Federico Chiesa, Morata and Cristiano Ronaldo.
