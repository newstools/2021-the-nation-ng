The Department of State Services (DSS) on Friday refuted reports they had attempted to arrest Sunday Igboho in Oyo State. Public Relations Officer, National Headquarters, Abuja, Dr Peter Afunanya, in a statement described it as fake news. A tersely worded statement by Afunanya reads: “The Department of State Services wishes to refute the news that it attempted to arrest one Sunday Igboho, today, at Ibadan, Oyo State. “The said news is misinforming and should be taken as fake and therefore be disregarded.”
