There are indications that a close-door meeting held on Satuday in Owerri, the Imo State capital, to find ways of reconciling the various factions of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, ended in a stalemate as the Chidi Ibem-led group refused to either attend or step down. The Nation learnt that the meeting, alleged to have been convened at the instance of Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, the Chairman of the Southeast Governors’ Forum, had invited the Chidi Ibeh-led Ohanaeze. According to an insider source, a close associate of Ibe, declined attendance because “we suspected the aim was to prevail on us to back down for the Amb. George Obiozor-led Ohanaeze.” Chidi Ibem failed to pick calls placed by The Nation correspondent last night but one of his close associates, who later spoke, but pleaded not to be named, confirmed that a meeting was actually called by the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi. The source added that “the meeting was inconclusive as Chief Ibem refused to accept the appeal by the governor and other leaders to back down.” But when he was contacted on the phone yesterday to confirm the meeting, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, an Ime Obi member of Ohanaeze, said “I am not aware of any Ohanaeze reconciliation meeting at the Government House here today. If there was such a meeting, perhaps, it is the governor that should speak on it.” It would be recalled that since the emergence of Prof. George Obiozor as the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, there has been controversies as Chidi Ibem maintained that he won the election that was conducted in Enugu. But a reconciliation committee set up by the President General of Ohanaeze Nidigbo worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor, to look into the grievances of those who contested the election, maintained that Chidi Ibem did not contest any election so they have nothing to do with him.
