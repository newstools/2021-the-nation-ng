Kwara State University (KWASU), Malete, has intensified efforts to shore up its internally generated revenue (IGR) by harnessing potential in the tourism sector within the state. Speaking recently with the Kwara State Deputy Governor, Mr. Kayode Alabi, chairman of KWASU’s sub-committee on tourism, Prof. Abduljeleel Ojuade said that the institution was poised to tap into the tourism opportunities in the state. He noted that the university wants the government’s support in transforming the Sobi Hill to a tourist attraction. Ojuade also said such move would not only open up opportunities for local and international tourists, but also enable job and wealth creation in the state. The Deputy Governor charged the sub-committee to submit a workable proposal to the state government, while assuring them that Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq would support such transformative plan. Alabi, however, urged the delegation to be serious with wealth creation for the university, noting that many untapped economic ventures and opportunities were waiting to be explored. An Ilorin- based Tourist Company, Angel Style World Travels and Tours Limited had sought to be KWASU’s official partner in the tourism sector. The company’s Director, Hajiya Faridah Shagayah, said the partnership would equip students of Tourism and Hospitality Management with practical knowledge and experience. She added that it would also provide job opportunities for the teeming population of unemployed youths in the state and the country at large. KWASU officials present at the meeting included, Prof. Fapojuwo Omololu, DVC, Administration; Mr. Mohammed Shuaib, Ag. Registrar; Prof. Abdulrazaq Kajogbola Ajao, Director, Centre for Sustainable Energy; Dr Binta Suleiman, Director, Centre for Archive and Documentation,among others.
