Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti has said it is putting efforts together to build an oxygen plant to aid in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the state. The institution’s Chief Medical Director, Prof. Kayode Olabanji, who stated this while addressing reporters over the weekend, said it was imperative to build the plant to ensure the availability of medical oxygen for COVID-19 patients. Olabanji bemoaned the spike in COVID-19 cases due to the second wave, noting that the provision of oxygen is crucial to the containment of the pandemic. He added that the demand for oxygen to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients has doubled in isolation centres due to the new strain of the infection, hence, the need to ensure availability in excess. “There is a higher demand for oxygen across the globe now due to coronavirus pandemic, especially the new waves we are experiencing now. The cost is even high and we are establishing our own oxygen plant here in the teaching hospital to assist us in managing the pandemic and, of course, other diseases and ailments.” “The new strains of COVID-19 are more virulent and devastating and that has increased our spending, especially in procuring oxygen. “We are doing this on a private partnership level and very soon, we will have it. It’s not only being useful for COVID-19 patients but some other patients who need it in the course of their treatment,” Olabanji said. Underscoring the importance of COVID-19 vaccines, he called on residents of Ekiti not to be apprehensive in taking the vaccines, but rather make themselves available anytime the vaccination starts.
