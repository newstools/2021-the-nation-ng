The Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Tayo Alasoadura, has said he received with sadness, news of the passing away of the Iralepo of Isinkan community in Akure South Local Government of Ondo State, Oba Joseph Olu-Ojo. He was one of the early sympathisers who visited the palace of the Iralepo to commiserate with the chiefs and children of the late monarch. In a statement by his media aide, Dayo Joe, Alasoadura described the death of the traditional ruler as a great loss to Isinkan and the entire state. “The late monarch was a humble and modest ruler, who lived a life of service to his people, the state and left behind a legacy of honour. “My interactions with the late Kabiyesi left me with the impression of a compassionate and kind hearted leader who cared for his subjects, as well as the unity and progress of the state,” the minister said. He prayed that the Almighty God will comfort the family, grant the deceased eternal rest and reward his good virtues while he lived. The Olori Omowa (Head of Princes) of Isinkan, Prince Durojaiye Adesagba Ariyo, thanked the dignitaries for their visits and singled out the honourable minister for commendation over his efforts at promoting unity and togetherness across Akure-speaking towns and villages.
