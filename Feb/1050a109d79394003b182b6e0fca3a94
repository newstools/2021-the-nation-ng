INTERNATIONAL Polo Federation (FIP) has hailed the President of the Nigerian Polo Federation (NPF), Francis Ogboro on his re-election as the boss of the polo governing body in Nigeria. The global sports’ authority in the message lauded the polo family on the sportsmanship and discipline conduct of both the delegates and the contesters before, during and after the polls that took place in Jos, the Plateau State capital early January, 2021. The goodwill messages also noted with pride, the relative peace and oneness within the Nigerian polo family in the last two decades under Ogboro as the head, and urged him and his management Committee team to re-dedicate themselves to the promotion of the noble game in Nigeria, Africa and the world at large. With about 30 polo clubs (Both private and public) spread across the country from Uyo, Yenagoa, Sokoto, Lagos and Maiduguri among others, FIP says the future of the king of games is truly in good hands. Ogboro thanked the Nigerian polo family for the confidence reposed on him to lead the NPF for two decades, adding that his relentless crusade of expanding the frontiers of Nigerian polo would be sustained in a way that would truly reflect Nigeria’s status as a power house of African polo.
