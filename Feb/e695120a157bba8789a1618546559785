He also served as Minister of Works and Housing under the Abacha regime. His son, Deji, a former House of Representatives member, said he showed no sign of illness in the last 24 hours. In fact, Jakande, fondly called Baba Kekere by admirers, revalidated his membership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday. Deji said: “We thank God for his life. He was not sick. He took his pap and crayfish yesterday. He was stil reading his newspapers without glasses. “We had stopped visitors from going to him because of Covid-19 because he likes shaking people.
