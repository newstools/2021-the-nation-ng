Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed, has said that he has no apology for his comment last week, kicking against the profiling of the Fulani tribe as killers and kidnappers. It will be recalled that the governor had come under intense criticism for saying herdsmen are carrying AK-47 for self defense. Mohammed who spoke Wednesday during the official launching of the 2020/2021 annual livestock vaccination campaign, held at Galambi Cattle ranch in Bauchi however said the labeling of a particular tribe with crime is unfair and breeds disunity in the country. He said; “We kicked against the profiling of the fulanis as killers and kidnappers, we have no apology for what we have done because what we have done is to say the truth, that there is no tribe or group that is free from criminality. ”We are not saying that to spite anybody or spark unnecessary controversy, we have made our point. Nigerians across the board has discussed it and I am happy to say that from all indications, majority of sensible Nigerians have appreciated what we have said and that is the point.” Governor Mohammed said that his administration will free resources which belongs to the Fulani pastoralists in order for them to have their own right of way, thereby reducing the conflicts between fulani herders and farmers. In another development, Benue State governor , Samuel Ortom has been criticized for accusing Mohammed of being a terrorist.
