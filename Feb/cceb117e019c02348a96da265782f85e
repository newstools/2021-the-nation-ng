 THE Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Akpen Leva, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately stop the Visa on Arrival Policy. Addressing a press conference on why “Buhari must act fast to save Nigeria from second civil war and disintegration” on Thursday in Makurdi, Benue state capital, the CAN chairman stated that herdsmen from countries like Chad, Mali, Niger, Cameroun and Burkina Faso have continued to troop into Nigeria and are the ones that are carrying highly sophisticated weapons and killing Nigerians on their ancestral land. He said Nigerian Fulani were not known for violence, but were known for carrying sticks in their business of animal husbandry. “We are worried by this ugly situation and we call on the President to without further delay stop the policy of Visa on Arrival to enable security agencies check the influx of militia herdsmen,” said the CAN chairman. The Benue CAN chairman also called on President Buhari to openly condemn the killing by herdsmen, saying “we have come to a level where anything that affect other Fulani herdsmen in Nigeria, the presidency reacts with immediate alacrity, but when other Nigerians are crying, it does not worry the presidency.” He called on the federal government to enforce open grazing law and compel all those involved in animal husbandry to ranch their cattle to avoid clashes between farmers and herders. On the recent call by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar  Malami (SAN), for creation of herdsmen commission, Rev. Leva said it is not relevant as the commission will not provide solution to the problem of insecurity but will rather empower herdsmen to continue to attack farming communities in the country.
