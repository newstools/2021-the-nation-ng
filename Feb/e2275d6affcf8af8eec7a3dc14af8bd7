 The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, said former Super Eagles defender Yisa Sofoluwe who died on Tuesday was somebody who came before his time. Dare, in a statement issued by his Media Office, said he was deeply shocked and sad to learn of Sofoluwe’s demise, especially as he died when help was on its way. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Sofoluwe died on Tuesday at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital at the age of 53. “The news of Sofoluwe’s death is quite devastating and one that hit me like a tornado. He was a great, committed, disciplined, humble and patriotic player. “He came ahead of his time. No wonder he was nicknamed `the Dean of Defence’ by ace commentator Ernest Okonkwo,” the Sports Minister said. While expressing his condolences and prayers to Sofoluwe’s wife, children, former teammates and the football community, Dare noted that Sofoluwe died just when help was on the way for him. “He died just when help was on the way for him to pay for his surgery. But his death is a huge loss. Rest in peace `Dean of Defence’,” the minister said. Similarly, President of the NFF, Amaju Melvin Pinnick, said he was nonplussed after receiving report that the former defender had breathed his last just when the process had been activated for a medical operation on him. “It is another sad, sad day. Just a couple of weeks ago, we were lamenting the loss of former goalkeeper and coach Joseph Erico. Now, Yisa Sofoluwe. That man was a gem in the green-and-white and did his very best for Nigeria whenever he was on the field. Personally, I have sweet memories of Yisa Sofoluwe. “It is more painful that he left just when help was coming to him from everywhere and the process was on to rectify his medical condition. We loved him but God loves him more. May his soul rest in peace.”
