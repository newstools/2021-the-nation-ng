Wilfred Ndidi is among eight players nominated for Leicester City’s Goal of the Month award for January 2021, informs the Foxes on their official website. The Nigeria international made the ten-goal shortlist for his effort in the Foxes’ 2-0 home win against Chelsea in the Premier League on January 19. Ndidi had gone 477 days without a goal before ending his drought against Chelsea, and it was worth the wait, as he netted a spectacular goal , thumping the ball home in off the far post with his weaker left foot following a short-corner routine. Strikes from James Maddison (2), Youri Tielemans, James Justin, Harvey Barnes, Natasha Flint (2), Charlie Devlin and Thanawat Suengchitthawon are also up for Leicester City’s Goal of the Month prize. Since joining Leicester City four years ago, Ndidi has tallied nine goals in 155 appearances across all competitions. The Nath Boys product has not figured for the King Power Stadium outfit since the 1-1 draw with Everton on January 27 due to injury but is nearing a return to fitness and will be assessed by the club’s medical team before the trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers.
