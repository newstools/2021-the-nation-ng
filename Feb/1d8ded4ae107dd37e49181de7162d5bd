 Serena Williams debuted a striking single-legged leotard in her first match in the Australian Open , paying homage to the Olympic track champion Florence Griffith Joyner, known for her long, colorful fingernails and flamboyant outfits. After wearing the black, red and pink cat suit to dispatch Germany’s Laura Siegemund, Williams credited Nike for coming up with the idea to channel FloJo, as the athlete was popularly known, and spoke of her admiration for the late athlete. “I was inspired by FloJo, who was a wonderful track athlete, amazing athlete when I was growing up. Well, watching her fashion, just always changing, her outfits were always amazing,” Williams told a press conference. “This year we thought of what can we do to keep elevating the Serena Williams on the court,” Williams said. The idea to tap FloJo for inspiration came from the Nike team, she told a press conference. “I was like, Oh, my God, this is so brilliant…Obviously we made some changes and tweaks to it. It became this.” Sprinter Flo-Jo, who hailed from Los Angeles, reigned supreme at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, winning the sprint double and guiding the United States to 4x100m relay gold.
