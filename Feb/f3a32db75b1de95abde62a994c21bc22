 MINISTER of Sports and Youth Development Mr Sunday Dare has disclosed that the Federal Government would launch Principalâ€™s Cup football competition in Lagos and Kaduna next week Friday. Dare, who disclosed this while addressing members of the South West Group of Online publishers (SWEGOP) in Ibadan on Saturday, said 41,000 secondary schools across the nation would participate in the football competition. The minister said the competition was one of the several efforts by the President Mohammadu Buhari administration to open up opportunities for youths to use their talents and energy to excel. He explained that the competition, which was formerly the football culture in South West Nigeria, would serve as an incubator to groom future international footballers among Nigerian youths. Dare said Nigerian football has suffered a setback for many years but that his ministry has developed a new strategy to revive it which is already yielding fruits. For example, he said his ministry has successfully made the Federal Government see sport as business rather than a mere entertainment activity. He added that he developed a new policy to achieve that, explaining that the new strategy of 3Is (Infrastructure, Incentive and Investment) is already driving a positive development of sports in the country. For instance, the policy, he revealed, has resulted in the renovation of the stadium at Surulere, Lagos under a partnership with the private sector.
