OLE Gunnar Solskjaer is ready to sit down and speak with Edinson Cavani about stretching his stay at Manchester United beyond the end of the season. Cavani’s Old Trafford contract is set to expire this summer but United have the option of automatically triggering a one-year extension. The 34-year-old has impressed since joining as a free agent in October, scoring six goals in 17 appearances while providing a positive dressing room influence for United’s younger players. Solskjaer stopped short of guaranteeing that Cavani’s stay would extend into a second season, but said he is pleased with the Uruguayan’s contributions so far. “I can only say Edinson has done well,” he said. “I’ve been impressed by him, he’s really gelled in the group and we’ll sit down and speak with him in the near future to see his plans and our plans. “It’s a good discussion to have. We always speak to the players and with his contract situation at the moment we’re very pleased with what he’s done.”
