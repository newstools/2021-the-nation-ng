 Super Eagles captain and former Leicester City forward Ahmed Musa is expected in the UK today ahead of agreeing a deal with West Brom. Musa is a free agent and, as Sportsmail revealed earlier this month, he has been invited in by Sam Allardyce to bolster Albion’s attacking options. The 28-year-old was due to arrive last week but there was a mix up over his arrangements to travel from Nigeria and he is now due to arrive in the early hours today. As a free agent he can sign out of the window but West Brom want to be convinced of his condition and fitness before they agree a contract. Musa also has interest from Fulham and his former club CSKA Moscow. The 95-cap Nigeria international made 33 appearances and scored five goals for the Foxes between 2016-2018 after signing for a then-club record fee of £16.6million. Boss Sam Allardyce insisted there could be more incomings before the transfer deadline but they would have to improve the squad for him to sanction a move.
