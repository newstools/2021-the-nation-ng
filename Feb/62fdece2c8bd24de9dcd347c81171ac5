Football icon John Barnes says Kylian Mbappe’s hat-trick heroics against Lionel Messi’s Barcelona doesn’t signal a ‘changing of the guard’ and comparing the two is akin to weighing up Tyson Fury to Muhammad Ali. Mbappe scored a stunning hat-trick as PSG secured a 4-1 win over Barca in their Champions League round of 16 first leg at Camp Nou, a result which all but guarantees their place in the tournament quarter finals. After upstaging Messi in his own backyard, many believed that the Frenchman’s performance signalled a changing of the guard and ended Messi’s era as one of two superior players of the modern game.
