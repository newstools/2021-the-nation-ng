 The Federal Government has appointed Foops Integrated Services Limited and Ace Global Depository to monitor pre-shipment agents. The Foops Integrated Services Limited will be covering the  Northeast, Northwest and Northcentral while Ace Global Depository will cover Southeast, Southwest, and Southsouth. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which announced the development in a circular, said Pre-Shipment Inspection Agents (PIAs) were also appointed for non-oil exports with effect from January 15, 2021. The firms are Angila International Limited with the responsibility to cover North West and North Central Zones; Neroli Technologies Limited to cover Southwest and Southsouth and Gojopal Nigeria Limited has the responsibility to cover the Southeast and Northeast. A circular by the CBN on January 26, 2021, and signed by its Director for Trade and Exchange Department, Dr. O. S. Nnaji, said  authorised dealers, operators in the non-oil export sector, and the public to ensure compliance. It would be recalled that in a revised policy, the Federal Government had said non-oil exports from Nigeria should be subject to inspection by Pre-Shipment Inspection Agents (PIAs). The focus of the PIAs shall be to ascertain the quality, quantity, and price competitiveness of exports from Nigeria and shall collaborate with other regulatory agencies like NAFDAC, SON, Plant and Animal Quarantine, Federal Produce Inspectorate, among others, for quality inspection of regulated products.
