 The unpreparedness of the prosecution counsel in the matter against a female official of Access Bank Plc, Olawunmi D. Audu, charged with the alleged theft of N197 million from a customer, led to the adjournment of the matter to March 22, 2021 for arraignment. When the matter came up on Monday, the prosecution counsel for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Halidu Mohammed, appealed for the matter to be adjourned by one month to enable them amend their charges. Auduâ€™s lawyer did not object to the appeal. Justice A. O. Ebong conceded to the appeal and adjourned the matter to March 22, 2021 for arraignment. Audu was docked at the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Zuba, for allegedly abetting the theft of the sum of N197, 200, 000 belonging to a customer and private company, De Chimex Aluminum and Steel Company Ltd.
