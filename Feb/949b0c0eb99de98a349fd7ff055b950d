Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State on Saturday disowned the 2022 Governorship campaign posters in his name, saying he is still preoccupied with the delivery of quality service to the people of the State. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Ismail Omipidan, said his principal had no hand in the poster and called on those behind the posters to tarry a while and wait for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to blow the whistle for the contest. His words: “I smell some kind of mischief and ulterior motive, especially as the promoter and patron of one of the media was a former Commissioner in the State. Whatever the motives or intentions are, they are dead on arrival. “For now, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State is more preoccupied with mobilising the people for membership registration and revalidation exercise, while Governor Oyetola is preoccupied with governance and not politicking. “The Governor appreciates the goodwill and the solidarity of those behind it, if truly they are genuine, but wishes to state that what is uppermost in his mind at the moment is to take Osun to greater heights. “He, therefore, appeals to those behind it to channel their efforts towards supporting government’s effort at changing the fortune of the State, which would probably make 2022 unattractive to the opposition.”
