  All eyes would be on D’Tigers in Group D as the final phase of the FIBA AfroBasket 2021 Qualifiers begins today with the Nigerian side staking their unbeaten run against giant-killing South Sudan side in Monastir, Tunisia. In what has been tagged do-or-die affairs for teams chasing places in the August finals taking place in Rwanda. D’Tigers under Coach Mfon Udofia will be hoping to maintain their unbeaten run from the last phase held in Kigali, Rwanda where the team edged out Mali, Rwanda and South Sudan. Udofia who replaced Mike Brown for this window of the qualifiers, was part of Nigeria’s technical bench at the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2019 and his experience would be brought to bear against Mali, Rwanda and South Sudan. “We know the importance of qualifying for the 2021 Afrobasket championships and qualifying well. We don’t just want to qualify, we want to qualify in style as well as ensure that we are on track for the 2020 Olympic Games preparation.” “The importance of playing well and continuing our winning tradition cannot be overemphasized. Since we opened camp on Sunday, we have been perfecting our game plans while in close touch with our senior coaches who are unavoidably absent.” Considered as the lowly-rated team in the team but South Sudan is a team to watch as their size and athleticism is unquestionable, and head coach Luol Deng’s skill set has proven vital in the First Round. Nigeria who narrowly lost to host-Tunisia at the finals of the 2017 edition is hoping to qualify as well as win the second ever Afrobasket title.
