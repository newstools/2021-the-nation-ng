An expectant teenager, Stella John, one of the 24 rescued from a Calabar baby factory, has said that each of the women got N2,000 for personal upkeep. Apart from the 24 expectant teenagers, 11 children were freed from the suspected baby-making facility by security operatives on Wednesday. Two suspects were taken into custody. The women and children were handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). Speaking on the premises of the Nigerian Army 13 Brigade Command headquarters in Calabar, one of the expectant teenagers Stella John said she was introduced to the place by one of her friends whose name she refused to mention. Stella said she received N2,000 weekly for her upkeep. The two suspects, the 24 teen mums and the 11 children were paraded before newsmen by the Officer Commanding 13 Brigade Provost, Maj. Stanley Ikepeme,  on behalf of the 13 Brigade Commander, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Abdullah. NAPTIP official Mr Oba Jacobs, who received the victims and suspects, said the suspects would be investigated and charged to court. The alleged owner of the baby factory, Mrs Fidelia Daniel, denied any knowledge of the factory, arguing that she didn’t know why she was arrested.
