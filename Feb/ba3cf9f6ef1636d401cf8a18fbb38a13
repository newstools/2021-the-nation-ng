Vivacious queen of ‘Bling’ and Chief Executive Officer, Enthyst Event Limited and Enthyst Fashion Klinik, Ndidi Obioha and her son, Brian, were serenaded on Monday, February 15 by friends and loved ones who flooded the small but classy gig where her birthday was celebrated in Lagos. She also used the occasion to open a new fashion store in Lagos and it was really fun for all her friends who honoured her. Ndidi, as she’s fondly called by her friends and business associates, is an unapologetic sucker for all that glitters. The well-grounded businesswoman always likes to make her statement loud.
