Ogun State Deputy Governor Noimot Salako-Oyedele has urged All Progressives Congress (APC) members to register at their wards, to enable the party remain the best in Nigeria. She spoke on Wednesday at the launch of registration and revalidation of the APC at Ward 3, Ota. Salako-Oyedele said members are expected to come out en masse to register, revalidate their membership and canvass for more people to join force in making the party great in the state. She said: “Politics is a game of number, not a social club. It exists through large numbers of members. Therefore, I enjoin every member to work harder to gain more people for the party.”
