The ‘N10million fraud’ trial of a self-proclaimed estate agent, Durojaiye Adetimi, could not hold at a Federal High Court in Lagos on Thursday following the judge’s absence. Parties to the proceedings were informed that the judge, Mr Saliu Saidu had retired from the ‘Bench’ and no new date had been fixed for trial. Justice Saidu fixed Thursday’s date on January 20, following Adetimi’s arraignment by the Force Criminal Investigation Department (ForceCID) Annex, Lagos, on two counts of conspiracy and obtaining by false pretence from one Olatunde Egbesola. The charge marked FHC/L/147c/2020 alleged that the defendant, one London-based Olayinka Dawodu and one Akinwunmi Lambo, who were said to be at large, sometime in 2007 conspired and defrauded Egbesola of the said sum, by falsely presenting to him that they wanted to redevelop his family house located at No. 10, Ojora Close, Victoria Island, Lagos. The offences, according to prosecution counsel Tijjani Williams, contravened sections 8(a), 1(1)(a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act of 2006 and punishable under Section 1(3) of the same Act. The defendant pleaded not guilty and is out on bail.
