The woes of defending English Premiership League champions Liverpool continued on Saturday with another 2-0 defeat to Everton. It was the fourth consecutive home defeat in the Meyerside derby, which Manager Jurgen Klopp has never lost until now. Richardson took a well-deserved first half goal before Sigurdisson got the second from the penalty spot. The defeat means Liverpool slip to seventh position on the EPL log with top four finish losing increasingly impossible.
