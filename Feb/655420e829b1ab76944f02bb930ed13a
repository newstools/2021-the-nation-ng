Bandits on Tuesday killed 10 persons and abducted 24 in a raid on some communities in Rafi council area of Niger State. Alhaji Masud Abubakar, a village head in the council, was killed, while his wife was abducted. Majority of those killed were said to be vigilantes who tried to stop the bandits but were outgunned. Residents said the attack began about 12.30 pm and lasted for three hours. A source said a helicopter was hovering over the area while the attacks lasted, though The Nation could not confirm it. Secretary to the council chair, James Isaac Jagaba confirmed the attack. In a statement, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello expressed outrage at the “alarming” and “nightmarish” activities of kidnappers and bandits in the state.
