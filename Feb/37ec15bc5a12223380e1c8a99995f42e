  Blessing Okagbare Sunday night won the 60m in a lifetime best of 7.17secs at the second American Track League series meeting in Fayetteville, United States. Despite her slow start in the race, Okagbare took the lead a few meters to the end ahead of Jamaica’s Christania Williams who finished second at 7.18secs. American duo of Kayla White and Morolake Akinosun, both timed at 7.20secs finished joint third in the race. An elated Okagbare said she hopes to compete in more races ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. “I am really excited to set a Personal Best (PB) in 60m and I am going to be here again. I am happy that I am a bit healthier now that I have been in the last four years. Also it is a great feeling to be back on track considering what has been happening since last year. So it is a great feeling to be back on track and I hope to compete indoors more this year,” she said. Meanwhile, at the first World Athletics Indoor Tour Gold meeting of 2021, African champion Tobi Amusan finished second behind Finland’s Nooralotta Neziri in the women’s 60m hurdles. Having won the first heat with a time of 8.01secs to qualify for the final, Amusan had to concede the title to her Finnish counterpart in the final. Neziri had progressed to the final as a non-automatic qualifier after finishing third in her heat in 8.01. But the 28-year-old, drawn in lane eight, put together the race of her life to win the final in 7.92, taking 0.05 off her own national record while Amusan ran 7.94 to settle for second place, just ahead of Netherlands’ Nadine Visser (7.96) and Belarus’ Elvira Herman (7.99). Also in the US, Ruth Usoro continued to amaze with a triple jump mark that ranks sixth in the world at the Texas Tech Invitational in Lubbock. Usoro landed a top jump of 46′-2″ (14.07m), eight inches shy of her 46′-10.25″ (14.28m) from the season opener, which stood as the world lead at the time.
