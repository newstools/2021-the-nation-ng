Ahmed Musa is drawing attention from other Premier League sides as he is yet to sign terms with West Brom. After being invited over by manager Sam Allardyce, the 28-year-old free agent and former Leicester City forward arrived in the country on Tuesday and underwent medical tests ahead of training at West Brom on Wednesday. The Nigeria international forward is understood to have impressed Allardyce and his coaching staff, who were hoping he would sign a contract until the end of the season and bolster their attacking options. However, Albionâ€™s Chinese owners have stretched their budget to the limit in the January window and are now struggling to release more funds to sign Musa. Albion brought in Ainsley Maitland-Niles from Arsenal, Okay Yukuslu from Celta Vigo, Mbaye Diagne from Galatasaray plus Robert Snodgrass and Andy Lonergan last month. One possible lifeline could come if West Brom winger Kamil Grosicki completes a move back to Poland with Legia Warsaw. They have asked about a loan though Albion would prefer a permanent transfer. That would free up some wages but free agent Musa may yet pursue other options with the likes of Burnley, Southampton, Brighton and CSKA Moscow all understood to be either willing to make him an offer or inviting him in to train with them instead. That leaves West Brom facing the prospect of losing Musa to one of their rivals.
