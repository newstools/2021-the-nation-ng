The controversy surrounding the Kaduna sex party took another twist yesterday at the resumed hearing, as police witnesses who arrested suspected organisers, told the court during cross-examination that there was no sex party on December 27, 2020 at Asher Restaurant and Lounge. Two of the witnesses presented by the Prosecutor ASP Shola Olodowa gave contradictory statements of what transpired on the said date but both agreed that there was no sex party. “I can identify three of the defendants but they were not half-naked and I cannot identify those half-naked because they jumped through the fence. We did not see any sex party on that day.” (27th December 2020) and those who jumped through the fence were those not observing social distancing,” he said. It would be recalled that the one storey building restaurant and lounge allegedly used for the controversial sex party was demolished by the State Government.
