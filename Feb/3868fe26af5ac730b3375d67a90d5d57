 Rangers have named their squad for the upcoming double-header against Royal Antwerp. Steven Gerrard’s side head into the Europa League’s last 32 full of confidence, having topped a group that featured Benfica, Standard Liege and Lech Poznan without losing a game. Into the squad come the Super Eagles duo of defender Leon Balogun and striker Joe Aribo along with Scott Wright and Jack Simpson, both of whom arrived at Ibrox on the final day of the transfer window. Jermain Defoe, however, misses out. He was involved earlier in the campaign but left out of the squad for the group stage, and he will remain on the sidelines for the round of 32. As quoted by Record Sport, Gerrard explained in October: “It doesn’t make sense to ask him to go Thursday-Sunday-Thursday-Sunday at his age and with the injuries he’s had. “We’ve made a decision to give him a different programme, a tailored programme that is a bit different from the rest so he can put in performances like he did at the weekend.” The Scottish Premiership leaders take on Antwerp in Belgium on February 18, with the return leg in Glasgow on February 25.
