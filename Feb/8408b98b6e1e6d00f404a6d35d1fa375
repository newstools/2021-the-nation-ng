The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested a suspected drug baron,Chidi Olife,10 years after  escaping arrest  and going underground. Olife had,in June 2010,allegedly brought into the country 5.250kg of heroin ,concealed in books. The agency said that following vital intelligence on the drug source, flight details, date and place of arrival, weight and mode of concealment, name, phone number and address of the recipient of the consignment, a planned controlled delivery operation was coordinated and led by the Commander NDLEA’s JTF, DCN Adeniyi Olumuyiwa. The operation led to the arrest of Oladimeji Oladotun and Alhaji Danjuma Idris while processing the documents for clearing the consignment. Both were the clearing agents allegedly hired by Chidi Olife, the owner of the drug. Upon being arrested, Alhaji Idris Danjuma, one of the clearing agents was used to effect the arrest of Oke Ningo who Olife contacted to receive the consignment from the agents on his behalf. However, he escaped arrest at the point of receiving the drug as he suspected the person with the clearing agent to be an NDLEA officer. Subsequently, NDLEA officials traced Olife’s residence to a street in Ajao Estate area of Lagos but before the JTF team could get there he had escaped with all members of his house due to the failed arrest of Oke Ningo. The JTF team of officers persisted with their investigation and kept trailing him until his arrest. The agency said its men are still trailing Oke Ningo. The NDLEA has also arrested an illicit drug dealer, Rabiu Imam at Unguwan Madina, Mubi North Local Government area of Adamawa State. Imam was arrested on Friday. Found in his house were Tramadol tablets 225mg weighing 45.4kg, Tramadol capsules 100mg weighing 550grms; and  Diazepam tablet 850grms.
