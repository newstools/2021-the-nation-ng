 Despite the huge investment on Victor Osimhen, the management of Napoli is worried over the inability of the Nigerian to score any goal in the last 100 days. Osimhen was signed on Napoli’s record transfer from Lille of France and the Nigerian is yet to hit the ground running since his movement to Italy while injury and COVID-19 has kept him out of action for over 77days. Since his return to action in the last three weeks, Osimhen has not scored or made any assist in all Napoli’s matches . Meanwhile, his attitude in their last Serie A tie against Juventus  where he  snapped  selfies with both Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianluigi Buffon after the game has drawn the ire of Italian football pundit Umberto Chiariello. Chiariello, a journalist and columnist for Canale 21, as well as director of the sports editorial staff of Radio Punto Nuovo reportedly told Area Napoli: “Did Osimhen understand that he is in Italian football and that he plays for Napoli? Why is he taking pictures with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gigi Buffon?”
