 The Federal Government will tomorrow release over N31.4 billion to state governments in keeping with its obligations to service its debts. The state governments will be credited with N31,440,652,571 tomorrow when the promissory notes issued to them by the government on February 18, 2019 matures. A source at the Debt Management Office (DMO) told The Nation that the government had made provision to redeem its matured promissory notes in the 2021 budget. Tomorrow, the state governments will have the option of collecting their money of “roll it over”. The February 18, 2021 matured promissory notes have been discounted by the federal government. State governments will receive another tranche of redeemed promissory notes valued at N5,849,212,443 on May 24, 2021. This means the government has been borrowing from state governments using promissory notes backed by good faith. Other redeemable promissory notes that will become due in a few months include N44,488,038,738 which the government will pay out on April 30, 2021 to government oil marketing firms.
