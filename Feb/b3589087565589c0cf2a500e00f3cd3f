 SENTRY has been moving around a lot of recent and in the process has been picking up lots of stories that that capture the pulse of the people at the moment. One thing that’s clearly on the minds of many is the alleged plan by the Federal Government to increase the price of petrol in coming weeks. If the government goes ahead with its plans, it would mean fire on the mountain for labour union leaders across the country. The scoop is that if the hike happens and labour leaders fail to take decisive steps to resist, workers will turn the heat on them more than ever before. That is what some birds told Sentry. It was gathered that Nigerians workers are tired of being burdened with high fuel price while salaries and other remunerations remain the same. The story is it that workers are not pleased with the kids’ gloves with which their leaders appear to be handling the issue of fuel price increase. And it appears a group of young unionists within the nation’s workforce are prepared to change the narrative should there be an increase in the price of fuel anytime soon.
