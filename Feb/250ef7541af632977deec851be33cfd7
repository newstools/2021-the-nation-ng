 Abia State Governor Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu says as a strong advocate of technical education, his administration would support any move towards setting up a technical university in the Southeast region. He said this when he received the outgoing Vice-Chancellor of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alaike Ebonyi State, Prof. Chinedum Nwajiuba at Government House in Umuahia. Ikpeazu said the nation’s economy would blossom if technical education is given priority attention. He stressed the need for Nigerians to take pride in patronising made in Nigeria goods as a way of promoting the nation’s economy. The Governor expressed delight with the latest feat achieved by the University in the area of production of Akwete Cloth, an indigenous fabric popularly produced in Ukwa East LGA of Abia State. He expressed happiness with Nwajiuba’s achievements in the area of technical education and other fields of study. Nwajiuba said the visit was to thank Ikpeazu for adding value to his administration as Vice Chancellor and for remaining a true scholar in governance. Highlight of the visit was the presentation of the Akwete cloth produced by the institution to the Governor.
