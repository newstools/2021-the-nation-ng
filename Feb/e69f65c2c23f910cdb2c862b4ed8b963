By Nicholas Kalu, Abuja The minority caucus in the House of Representatives has mourned the death of one of its members, Hon. Ossy Chinedu Prestige (Aba North/South). The caucus, in a statement by the Minority Leader of the House, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, on Wednesday, described the late Hon. Prestige as a brilliant and exceptionally committed legislator, who remained dedicated in service towards the unity and development of the country. The caucus said: “Hon. Prestige gave his best in representing his people at the National Assembly. He remained a strong voice in fighting for the upholding of democratic tenets of good governance, equality, social justice, equity, fairness and respect for the rule of law in our country. “He was a very friendly and hard-working lawmaker, who also brought to bear, his wealth of experience in the corporate world to all the tasks assigned to him as a federal legislature. “Indeed, the memories of this remarkably patriotic Nigerian will remain indelible, not only in our caucus but also in the House of Representatives, the National Assembly and indeed, the nation at large, for many generations to come. “The Minority Caucus commiserates with the family of Hon. Prestige, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu as well as the government and people of Abia state, particularly, Aba North/South Federal Constituency, and prays God for consolation and fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.”
