A housewife Ramatu Idris of Unguwar Malam Lamu, Tankarau, Dutsen Abba Ward in Zaria Local Government Area (LGA), has narrated how bandits made her a widow less than a month after her marriage to Yusuf Suleiman. Idris told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday that the incident happened on February 4 about 12.45 p.m., 28 days after her wedding to Suleiman. “There were about seven of them (bandits). They forced themselves into our home holding guns and a stick. “My husband and I went to find out what was happening on hearing noises and shouts for help, but he was shot in the neck in my presence and he died on the spot. Idris said those who killed her husband were the same criminals that raided the residence of Alhaji Abdulaziz Sani, councilor representing Dutsen Abba Ward, and abducted six of his family members.
