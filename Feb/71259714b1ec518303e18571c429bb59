 The National Executive of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has set Telehealth Solutions Initiatives to cater for the health needs of one million vulnerable Nigerians as the world battles COVID-19. This was stated in a statement issued and signed by the NARD President, Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, and Chairman, NARD Telehealth Committee, Dr. Kenneth Uwajeh, and made available to The Nation yesterday in Lagos. They said NARD 1 in a Million Program, is a revolutionary medical outreach programme for one million Nigerians targeted at increasing COVID-19 awareness from screening for symptoms, prevention and management, mainly targeting the grassroots via digital means (Telemedicine). They lamented that COVID-19 pandemic has left its indelible marks on our association and nation at Large; NARD has therefore fashioned a way to embark on a programme to curb the menace of COVID-19. “This is our chance to write history as COVID-19 is the greatest challenge ever faced in modern times. In the process we not only save our nation but save the continent and the world,” they said.
