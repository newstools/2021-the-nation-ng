Who leads the police as Inspector General from Tuesday? There is uncertainty at the Louis Edet House police headquarters in Abuja as a result of the silence from President Muhammadu Buhari and the seat of power – Aso Villa. The tenure of IG Mohammed Adamu expires today; he has completed his 35 years maximum to stay in the police, having enlisted on February 2, 1986. Adamu, who will turn 60 on September 17, was appointed as the IGP in January 2019. He has spent two years in office. Three Deputy Inspectors-General of Police (DIGs) and 10 Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) are also due for retirement with him today. It is believed that there is a campaign to extend Adamu’s tenure But some have argued against such extension, because it would contradict the provisions of the Police Act 2020 that pegs the retirement of police officers at 60 years of age or 35 years of service. Section 18(8) of the new Act states: “Every police officer shall, on recruitment or appointment, serve in the Nigeria Police Force for 35 years or until the age of 60 years, whichever is earlier.” The Act provides for a tenure of four years for the Inspector General of Police. Section 7, subsection 2 of the Act provides that: “The person to be appointed as Inspector General of Police shall be a senior police officer not below the rank of Assistant Inspector General of Police with the requisite academic qualification of not less than a first degree or its equivalent, in addition to professional or management experience.” However, so far, the President’s intentions remain unclear as he has kept his decision close to his chest.
