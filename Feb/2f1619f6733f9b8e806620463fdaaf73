A notorious mentally challenged nursing teenage girl has been rescued by the Anambra State’s Commissioner for Women and Children Affairs, Lady Ndidi Mezue in Onitsha, the commercial city of the state. The victim who lived dangerously in a gangway under the Niger Bridge in the area was reportedly rescued with her infant baby with a large amount of money recovered from her. A statement from the ministry said the exercise was carried out through its Social Welfare Department. The statement partly read, “The rescue was effected following a call to the Honorable Commissioner by an Asaba resident who plies the bridge to work at Nigeria Bottling Company Onitsha. “On receiving the call for help, the Commissioner deployed a team of social workers whom after days of planning and visits to the dangerous abode of the nursing mother, successfully rescued her and her son. “During interrogation which was personally conducted by Lady Ndidi Mezue at her office, the mentally challenged lady gave her name as Ngozi an indigene of Abia state and a former resident of Onitsha Army Barracks.” The statement quoted the commissioner, “I am relieved that this difficult rescue operation was carried out successfully by my team, we equally recovered a large amount of money from her. “I am glad that mother and child are being taken care of in government facility until the girl’s family comes forward to identify her.”
