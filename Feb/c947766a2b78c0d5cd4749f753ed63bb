Police in Rivers State have arrested three members of the state vigilante group OSPAC in Rumuolumeni community, Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the State. Their arrest was in connection with an alleged attempted murder of one Clifford Woko. Woko, an indigene of the community, had refused to pay building levy to members of the group. The OSPAC men attacked him, it was said. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni confirmed the development. “A report was made in our office that OSPAC members attacked a member of the community and inflicted machete cuts all over his body especially on his back. We went there to arrest them for investigation and possibly to institute a case of attempted murder charge against them; we arrested three of the members in connection with the allegation, and we have commenced investigations,” he said. A community source said the police raided the OSPAC office following their men’s refusal to honour police invitation in respect of the assault report lodged by the victim against them.
