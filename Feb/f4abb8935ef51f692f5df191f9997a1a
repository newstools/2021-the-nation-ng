 A chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Ogun State, Prince Tope Armstrong Akintunde, has lauded the decision of the former governor of the state, Otunba Gbenga Daniel to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to APC. He said the former Ogun State governor remained an invaluable asset to the ruling party in the state. The real estate merchant also commended the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) for returning to his root, Ikenne Remo, in Ikenne local government to revalidate his APC membership saying that this was not only a major achievement for the party, but a great effort to further strengthen the ruling party in the state. Armstrong, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Aerofield Homes, told reporters that with the former national leader of the opposition party in the state, Otunba Daniel, the good government of Prince Dapo Abiodun and purposeful leadership of Chief Yemi Sanusi led Caretaker Committee of the APC had just succeeded in uprooting the opposition elements in the state. Speaking over the defection, Akintunde said: “It’s obvious that the defection of the calibre of Otunba Gbenga Daniel’s towering status politically into our great party is really a great catch, really too good to be true”. “Here is a man to first served twice as the governor of the state with lot of achievements in poverty alleviation, youth empowerment and employment, massive rural development across the 20 local governments, opening up of the state for serious economic prosperity among others and 10 years after leaving office, people are still talking about his legacies. “He is definitely coming to add a lot of values to our great party as well as the government of Prince Dapo Abiodun that has remained committed to making life a lot easier for everyone in Ogun State. This is also in addition to our Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) who returned home last week to revalidate his party membership, Ogun APC is indeed poised for the next level”, he said.
