Ruben Dias and John Stones struck as Premier League leaders Manchester City moved 13 points clear with a hard-fought 2-1 win over West Ham. The defensive pairing netted either side of an equaliser from Michail Antonio, who had earlier hit the post for the determined visitors at the Etihad Stadium. City’s victory was their 20th in succession as they chase glory on four fronts. They also had the welcome sight of record goalscorer Sergio Aguero back in their starting line-up for only the fourth time this season, even though the Argentinian had a quiet game. On this occasion the lack of an effective striker did not matter as their in-form centre-backs delivered the goals. They may have conceded a home goal in the Premier League for the first time since December 15, but they made up for that by demonstrating their potency up front. City started slowly, looking to dominate possession and patiently carve out chances. West Ham saw little of the ball in the early stages and, even when they did, they repeatedly gave away possession. Yet the openings did not come easily for City and it was West Ham who first created confusion in an opponents’ box when a Jesse Lingard shot took a deflection and looped into the air. Tomas Soucek was the first to react to head across goal and Antonio collided with Ederson in the ensuing scramble. Lingard followed up with another shot but Stones blocked. With Aguero quiet on his first start for four months after injury and illness, it was not until the half-hour mark that City first seriously threatened – and it brought them the lead.
