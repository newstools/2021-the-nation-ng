Manchester United have reportedly been in discussions with Bruno Fernandes since November over a new and improved contract at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old has scored 29 times and registered 20 assists in 54 appearances for the Red Devils since arriving from Sporting Lisbon last January, including 17 goals and 12 assists in 32 outings this term. Fernandes’s existing deal with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side is due to run until June 2025, with the option of an additional 12 months, but according to The Athletic, the Portugal international is in line for a bumper new contract. The report claims that United have been in discussions with the attacker over the last three months with the view to handing him a new and improved deal in 2021. Fernandes has been key to United’s rise to second position in this season’s Premier League, contributing 12 goals and 10 assists in 22 appearances in England’s top flight. Real Madrid and Barcelona are reportedly both keeping a close eye on the playmaker ahead of this summer’s transfer window.
