Kidnappers on Monday attacked a funeral convoy in Edo State. They abducted the younger brother of the deceased and shot a driver dead. The convoy, which was coming from Lagos en route to Enugu, was attacked at the Benin Bypass near Ahor community, now notorious for kidnapping. The ambulance was badly damaged by the attackers, who shot directly at the vehicles on the convoy. The driver of the vehicle behind the ambulance was killed. Driver of the ambulance, with registration number: Lagos KRD 782 GO, Mr. Salami Orijiwa, disclosed that he and others left Lagos at 6 am in order to make the journey early to Enugu. He said: “One of the men was holding a gun, another a cutlass. Suddenly, I saw another man in front of the vehicle, who pointed a gun at us and shot. I quickly bent down, but I lost control, veered into the bush and fell into a ditch. The bullet hit the vehicle behind me and the driver died on the spot.” The kidnappers later contacted members of the family of the victim, demanding N5 million. Police spokesman Chidi Nwabuzor could not be reached at press time.
