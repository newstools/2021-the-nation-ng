Current developments in the camp of former Oyo State Governor, Rashid Ladoja and the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) are strong indications that all is not well within. If you add some statements emanating from the politician’s top aides, you will be left to wonder what exactly is going on in Ladoja’s camp. Amidst talk about his readiness to quite ZLP and move his camp into another party, his associates are daily being linked with moves to the two leading political parties, leading to discordant tunes from their ranks. Last week, the leadership of the ZLP in the state met with the All Progressives Congress (APC) to discuss merger. At the end, the meeting, which was held at Premier Hotel, Mokola, Ibadan, was adjudged fruitful by both parties. The 2019 governorship candidate of ZLP, Sharafadeen Alli, led Ladoja’s loyalists to the meeting, while the acting chairman of APC, Chief Akin Oke, led his party’s team. Ladoja’s men at the meeting included the Chairman, Senate Committee on Local Content, Teslim Folarin, representing Oyo Central Senatorial District; two members of the House of Representatives, Segun Odebunmi, representing Ogo-Oluwa/Surulere Federal Constituency and Akeem Adeyemi, representing Oyo Federal Constituency. Former Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Adeolu Adeleke, was also there. Few days later, Governor Seyi Makinde and the Chairman, Governor’s Advisory Council, Senator Hosea Agboola, received some loyalists of Ladoja at Government House. Led by the state chairman of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Comrade Wole Abisoye, they pledged allegiance to Makinde and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Abisoye said he stayed away from the recent meeting of the party led by Alli with the APC because PDP was a better home.
