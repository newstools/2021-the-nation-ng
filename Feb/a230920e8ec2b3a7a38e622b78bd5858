Justice Hakeem Oshodi of an Ikeja High Court has sentenced one man Shola Agboola to 21 years imprisonment for armed robbery. Justice Oshodi Thursday convicted Agboola after finding him guilty of a three-count charge brought against him by the Lagos State government in charge No. ID/706c/14. The convict was earlier arrested by Police and arraigned by the State Government on a four-count charge dated 3rd August 2014 bordering on armed robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery and assault on two persons who were his victims. The Prosecuting Counsel, Olabisi Ogungbesan, of the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP), State Ministry of Justice, had urged the court to convict Agboola as charged in view of the gravity of the offence. During the trial, the prosecutor argued that the testimonies of four witnesses and the five exhibits tendered before the court confirmed the allegations of the crime against the defendant. Delivering judgment in the matter, Justice Oshodi held that the evidence provided by the prosecution were credible and compelling. Justice Oshodi found the defendant guilty as charged and convicted him in accordance with provisions of section 297, 295 (2a) and 172 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015.
