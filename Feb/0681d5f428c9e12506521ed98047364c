The All Progressive Congress (APC) ward chairman of Gboko south, Tersoo Ahu, has been killed by gunmen in Gboko on Sunday. Ahu and other APC ward excos were said to be engaged in the training of party officials for membership registration and revalidation exercise when gunmen stormed the venue with clubs, cutlass as well as iron and manhandled him. The publicity secretary of the APC, Benue chapter, James Orgunga, who confirmed the incident, said the ward chairman who sustained serious injuries from the attack died later at a public hospital in Gboko, where he was receiving treatment. The brutal killing of the APC ward chairman in Gboko, the ancestral home of the Tiv people, may not be unconnected with the alleged factions within the party over the 2023 general election. The Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO) of the Benue Command Kate Anene, a DSP, confirmed the incident and said the investigation has commenced arresting the suspects. “Yes I can confirm the attack and killing of the APC ward chairman in Gboko, our men rushed to the scene but the suspects fled. However we have identified them and very soon we shall pick them up,” DSP Anene said.
