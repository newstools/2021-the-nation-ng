Lautaro Martinez was at the double and Romelu Lukaku also scored as Inter took a giant step towards their first Scudetto since 2010 with an epic 3-0 victory over rivals AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. In the most significant league meeting between the rivals since April 2011 – the last time the sides met holding the top two positions in the table – Inter started the match leading Milan by a point at the summit. And it was Antonio Conte’s leaders who drew first blood when Lukaku’s inch-perfect cross was converted by the head of Martinez after just five minutes. Milan had entered the contest on the back of a shock defeat to Spezia last weekend as they relinquished their place atop of the league and Stefano Pioli’s side had failed to win this season after falling behind. Inter were well worth their lead at the break, although Theo Hernandez did spurn a great chance to draw Rossoneri level. But Milan made a flying start to the second half and Inter had Samir Handanovic to thank for protecting their clean sheet as the 36-year-old denied two quickfire Zlatan Ibrahimovic headers before repelling Sandro Tonali. Inter, however, took control of the contest with a fine team goal against the run of play finished by Martinez from Ivan Perisic’s assist before Lukaku put the game beyond their opponents with a lovely strike on the counter-attack. The Belgian is the first Inter player to score in four consecutive Milan derbies in Serie A in over 70 years and capped a wonderful day for Antonio Conte’s side, who move four points clear of AC Milan at the top of the table.
