Gunmen have attacked a police station in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State, killing a guard duty official. It was also learnt that the attackers looted the police armoury, carting away several arms and ammunition, triggering fear of heightened insecurity in the city. The Nation gathered that the hoodlums swooped on Abayi Police Station at World Bank Estate in Abayi Local Government Area about 2am on Monday morning. A source said the attackers numbering over 20 took the policemen on duty unawares, killing a sentry man instantly and taking away his weapon. A report claimed that two policemen were killed in the attack, but a police source said it was one operative that died. Another report said some hoodlums also raided a riot police armoury in Umuahia, the state capital, where they removed several guns and ammunition but The Nation was unable to confirm that claim before press time. The state government has condemned the attack, pledging that it would ensure that the attackers are caught and punished. The government also offered a N1 million bounty for any information leading to the arrest of the attackers, information commissioner John Okiyi-Kalu said in a statement yesterday.
