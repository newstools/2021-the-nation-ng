An offensive by a mix of police operatives, vigilantees and hunters in Adamawa State against members of a robbery gang has resulted in the killing of two of the gangsters and arrest of one. Other members of the gang fled after they were overpowered in the shootout, which occurred in the early hours of Monday around the Numan end of the Numan-Jalingo Highway. The Police imagemaker in Adamawa State, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said in a statement Monday morning the successful security operation was launched on the order of the Commissioner of Police, CP Aliyu Adamu, “after a good Samaritan” reported that the robbery suspects were operating. He added the security operation, which was led by the DPO in charge of Numan Division, recorded success because the DPO was quick in mobilising his men and members of the helpful vigilantee group and hunters’ union. According to him, Dane guns, sharp knives, cutlasses and charms were recovered from the suspects just as one of them, Ashidu Balari, a resident of Lafiya in Lamurde local government area of Adamawa State, was arrested with injuries he received from the shootout. “The suspect who is now receiving treatment is being investigated in connection to Criminal Conspiracy and Armed Robbery. “Meanwhile, the Command has commended the Police operatives of Numan Division for their immediate response which resulted in the successes recorded. “The CP, while appreciating the vigilantes/hunters in Numan for their cooperation and support so far, calls for improved partnership and collaboration between the citizens and the Police particularly in the areas of providing credible and actionable information to the Police which is required in tackling crimes and apprehending unrepentant criminals in the state. “The suspect will be charged to court as soon as investigations is concluded,” Nguroje stated.
