There was pandemonium in Abuja on Wednesday when some top management staff of Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) allegedly abandoned their cars and scaled perimeter fence to evade arrest by Federal Capital Territory (FCT) COVID-19 enforcement team. NSITF was alleged to have gathered a large crowd of its staff across the country for a promotional examination exercise at M and M Event Centre, Area 11, Garki. Head, Media and Enlightenment of the  FCT COVID-19 enforcement team, Comrade Ikharo Attah, said his team stormed the NSITF’s examination venue,  following a tip-off that the exercise was going on without compliance with COVID-19 health protocols. He noted that while NSITF labour leaders resisted arrest of the offending officers, they also took advantage of the rowdy situation to jump through the fence and escaped. Attah, however, confirmed that the fund’s General Manager, Health Safety and Environment and other top directors escaped. But one person was arrested. Attah, who expressed disappointment that a frontline agency of government like NSITF failed to lead by example, also vowed that the fleeing directors and others who flouted the presidential regulations shall be prosecuted. While reiterating the commitment of the FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammad Bello, to the health and safety of all residents, he warned that the laws will not spare any organisation or individual that violates the presidential regulations.
