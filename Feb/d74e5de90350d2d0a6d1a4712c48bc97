 President, Nigeria Institution of Surveyors (NIS), Alabo Charles has said the Surveyors Registration Council of Nigeria (SURCON) Act is to be reviewed in line with  global best practices. He said a committee for the reform of the profession would soon be set up, adding that the committee would consult to achieve its aim. Alabo, however, queried the rationale behind the non-consultation of the national body before instituting a case against the Lagos State Government by SURCON and some members of the NIS in Lagos. “It is regrettable that some people took Lagos State Government to court without recourse to the national body. We can only hope that the case which is an interpretation issue registration will result to a landmark case and raise the barometer of the institution. We sincerely want to see how the matter will be resolved within the ambiguities of the Nigerian court processes, “ Alabo said. It will be recalled that the members of NIS dragged the Lagos State Surveyor-General, the Surveyors Registration Council of Nigeria (SURCON) and Lagos State Attorney- General before the Federal High Court, Lagos over alleged breach of the constitution and SURCON Act. The bone of contention was the recent appointment of seven surveyors by the Surveyor-General of the State as the only surveyors to carry out surveys in the Mende Revocations Area, Maryland, in Lagos State.
