The statement said this was all contained in the November 2020 edition of the NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR). According to Obateru, the trading surplus or trading deficit is derived after the deduction of the expenditure profile from the revenue in the period under review. The report indicated in November 2020, NNPC Group’s operating revenue as compared to October 2020, decreased slightly by 0.02 per cent or ₦0.09billion to stand at ₦423.08 billion.

overall, expenditure as a proportion of revenue was 0.97 in November 2020 as against 0.98 in October 2020.
