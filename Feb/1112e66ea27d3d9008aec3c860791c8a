But the hoodlums dispossessed her colleague of the hand bag and phones before letting her go. Narrating the story, the eyewitness said: “we were halted by traffic jam at Woji railway crossing when an armed man approached our car and asked Chidiebere to wind down. “When she winded down, he showed her the gun and asked her to quietly move to the side and park, out of fear, she struggled and parked. “It was at that point that about three other men emerged from God knows where and asked her to come down the vehicle and follow them. “They marched her to their SUV car also parked by the corner. While that was happening, one of the men asked me to surrender my bag and phones, I did and they drove off with her.” Asked if Police were aware of the development, said she went and reported the case at Mini-Okoro Police station, which is not too far from the scene of abduction. Rivers Police Public Relation Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, a Superintendent of Police, assured the Police were on top of the situation, adding they were doing everything within their powers to ensure she regains her freedom as soon as possible.
