The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has mourned the passing away of a veteran journalist, Tony Momoh, describing it as a sad development. Momoh, a former Minister of Information during the Ibrahim Babangida era, died on Monday at the age of 81. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, the Speaker said Momoh would be remembered for his selfless service to his fatherland. Gbajabiamila said the APC chieftain was one Nigerian who contributed immensely to the development of the party and the country. The Speaker sent his condolences to Momoh family, the people and the Government of Edo State and prayed God would give them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss, even as he prayed eternal rest for the soul of the late Momoh. Similarly, the Speaker has commiserated with Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa over the demise of her mother, Alhaja Sadiat Abeke Erogbogbo. He said the passing away of Alhaja Sadiat, a retired teacher and businesswoman at the age of 90, was a painful loss, considering the role she played in the family of the chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Diaspora Commission. As a teacher, Gbajabiamila said, Alhaja Sadiat gave her best to ensure she turned out good students for the benefit of society. He prayed Almighty Allah to forgive Alhaja Sadiat and reward her with Jannatul Firdaus.
