 Manchester City left Liverpool’s title defence in tatters as Ilkay Gundogan’s double and two costly mistakes from Alisson Becker inspired the Premier League leaders’ dazzling 4-1 win, while Harry Kane starred in Tottenham’s 2-0 victory against West Bromwich Albion. Inspired by Gundogan’s goals and Phil Foden’s stylish display, City moved 10 points clear of fourth placed Liverpool after their first win at Anfield since 2003. The troubled champions were blown away by Pep Guardiola’s side, who became the first team to score four times in a league game at Anfield in 12 years. City hold a five-point lead over second placed Manchester United and have a game in hand on their local rivals as they eye a third title in four seasons. They have won 14 successive games in all competitions to equal the record for an English top-flight club, set by Preston in 1892 and Arsenal in 1987. Despite the prolonged absences of Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero, City have shrugged off their slow start to the season and sit in pole position to win the title. “We have done brilliantly so I cannot deny how happy we are. To come here and finally win, it’s very important,” Guardiola said. “I’m so grateful to my players but this is now the past. In February no one is champions.” In stark contrast, Liverpool are in disarray after losing three consecutive home league games for the first time since 1963. They have won just two of their last nine league matches as injuries and fatigue take their toll. “We made two massive mistakes, that is clear. There is not a real explanation. Maybe he had cold feet? It sounds funny but it could be,” said coach Jurgen Klopp of the two poor clearances from Alisson that led to City goals. “They used them and 3-1 down in a game like this, when you are that long level, it is tough to take.”.
