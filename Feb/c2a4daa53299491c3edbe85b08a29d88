 The best graduating student of the Joseph Ayo Babalola University (JABU) for the 2019/2020 academic session, Miss Esther Fashola, says she plans to have a stint in journalism before going for post-graduate study. Esther graduated with a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 4.89 in Mass Communication. She attributed her academic success to the knowledge she acquired during her secondary school days. She also credited her family and friends for their support. “My mother was my mentor throughout my education. I owe everything to her. “The journey has not been easy. Our lecturers gave us the best. Thank God I was able to meet up. I didn’t choose JABU as my first choice. It was my uncle that brought me here. “In my first year, I was surprised at my result. I had to work hard to keep it up. I was poor in my SS1 but I had to work hard and I won six prizes in my SS2. I know what I wanted to study so I went for Mass Communication. I am confident and I like writing,” she said.
