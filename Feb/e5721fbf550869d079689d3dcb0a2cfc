  Nigeria’s fortunes in the boxing event of the Tokyo  Olympic Games continues to be a mirage following  the cancellation of the final qualifiers  due to take place in Paris in June. This development means Nigeria which had earlier missed out from the African qualifiers in Senegal early 2020 would not be competing in boxing at the rescheduled Tokyo Olympic Games in Japan. About 53 quota places that would have been available at the World Olympic Qualifier will now be assigned based on rankings instead, with the best-ranked boxer per region, per weight category receiving a Tokyo 2020 berth. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) Boxing Task Force (BTF) said the changes to the qualification system ensure athletes from all regions have an equal chance to qualify for the Games. The Tokyo 2020 boxing tournament is being organised by the BTF after the IOC suspended recognition of the International Boxing Association in May 2019 over long-standing governance, finance and ethics concerns. From the 25 medals won by Nigeria at the Olympic Games, boxing had contributed six with Nojim Maiyegun winning the first medal after settling for bronze at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games in Japan. Also at the 1972 edition in Munich, Germany, Isaac Ikhuoria settled for bronze, while Peter Konyegwachie improved the country’s status after finishing with a silver medal at the 1984 Los Angeles.     David Izonritei and Richard Igbineghu claimed silver medals at 1992 Barcelona Games in Spain while the last medal in boxing was won by Duncan Dokiwari after settling for bronze at Atlanta 1996.
