The primary responsibilities of Nigeria in the countries you are posted to rests on you. I urge you to go out and serve with uttermost dedication and pride. “You must not forget that you have been posted to respective bilateral and multilateral missions, to represent and project Nigeria as a great and indivisible nation and a very attractive investment destination. “As ambassadors of our country, your comportment, courage, conduct and ability to multi task must be exemplary. Humility and firmness are attributes that can earn you and your country respect and recognition. These attributes must remain with every one of you in fulfilment of your duties,” he said. President Buhari reminded the ambassadors of his administration’s nine priority areas of building a thriving and sustainable economy, ensuring poverty reduction, food security and fight against corruption, among others.
