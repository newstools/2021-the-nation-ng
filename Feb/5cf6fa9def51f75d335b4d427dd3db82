The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) said it had begun moves to secure the release of protesters who demonstrated at the Lekki toll gate as part of the #EndSARS Season 2 and #OccupyLekkiTollgate movement. NBA’s President Olumide Akpata condemned what he described as the Police’s “shocking” and “unlawful actions” against protesters and demanded their immediate release. He offered free legal representation to protesters without a lawyer. The Nation reports that no fewer than 23 persons, including passersby, have been arrested by operatives of the Lagos Police Command deployed to the Lekki Toll Gate. The Federal Government and the police had warned youths who planned to protest at the Lekki tollgate to shelve the idea, a directive condemned by lawyers and rights activists. The protesters said their action was informed by the decision of the panel allowing the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) to reopen the Lekki Toll Gate. Speaking via a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, Akpata said: “The images & footages of the unlawful actions of the Nigerian Police at the Lekki Tollgate Lagos are truly shocking. ” The @NigBarAssoc condemns the brazen disrespect for the fundamental rights of unarmed citizens who are merely exercising their rights to peaceful protests. “We are currently working together with members of our Association to ensure the release of those detained. “At the moment, we understand that the detainees are spread across Panti, Adeniji and Ikeja Police Stations and that they are currently being denied access to their Lawyers. “This is totally unacceptable and we call on the Police to immediately release them or allow them unhindered access to their lawyers. “For protesters who do not have legal representation the @NigBarAssoc is setting up a team of volunteer lawyers who will immediately represent them.”
