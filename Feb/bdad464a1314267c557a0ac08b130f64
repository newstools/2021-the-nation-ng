A graduating Higher National Diploma student in the Department of Microbiology, Osun State Polytechnic, Iree, Apeke Omorinsola, reportedly died on Tuesday night a few hours after she wrote her last paper. One of her mates, simply identified as Mola, told The Nation that Apeke was slightly ill during her last paper in the exam hall and she was taken to the medical centre where she was stabilised. “She wrote her last paper at the medical centre before she was discharged. “However, when she got home, she went to a party to celebrate writing her last paper. When she returned home, she suffered an asthmatic attack. She was rushed to several hospitals before she eventually died,” a source said. Spokesman for the school Tope Abiola confirmed the incident. He said: “The polytechnic sympathises with the bereaved family and other students.”
