Enyimba have qualified for the group stage of the 2020-21 CAF Confederation Cup after edging fellow Nigerian side Rivers United on penalties in Port Harcourt on Sunday. The Aba side led 1-0 from the first leg of the final qualifying series but Rivers United levelled matters on aggregate when Malachy Ohawume scored just before the break. With neither side able to find a breakthrough in normal time, the tie went to penalties to decide Nigeria’s representatives in CAF’s second-tier competition. And it was eight-time Nigerian champions Enyimba who prevailed, triumphing 5-4 in the ensuing penalty shootout with goalkeeper John Noble scoring the decisive kick after he’d saved Israel Emmanuel’s effort. Cyril Olisema missed Enyimba’s first kick, but Enyimba recovered to score their next five kicks. Kunle Odunlami also missed from the spot for Rivers United. Enyimba’s coach Fatai Osho in his post-match interview believes his team would have performed better on a better turf but praised his team for winning regardless of the unfavourable condition. “The pitch didn’t help our game plan. Kudos to my boys,” Fatai Osho said. The Aba Elephants who reached the semi-finals in 2018 will discover their group stage opponents when draws are conducted tomorrow at the CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.
