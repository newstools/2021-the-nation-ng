Former Minister of State for Defence, Ademola Seriki, has settled his obligation with the corporation and collected his letter of non-indebtedness. This followed negotiations and eventual restructuring of his huge indebtedness by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). The Head Corporate Communications AMCON, Jude Nwauzor confirmed that the former minister negotiated with the Corporation and both parties eventually reached a settlement term, which has also been fulfilled. “So, having met all conditions as agreed in the terms of settlement he (Seriki) is no longer indebted to AMCON,” Nwauzor explained. Seriki was also former Supervising Minister for Mines and Steel Development and Nigeria Ambassador designate to Spain. He said the gesture shows even though AMCON may be in court with a good number of its obligors, the Corporation is ever ready to listen to the voice of reason especially for responsible debtors who genuinely wants to settle their debt amicably without going through a lengthy and unnecessary judicial process.
