 The founder and Chief Executive Officer, FiamWiFi,  Akin Marinho, yesterday said high cost of data is inimical to the development of the information communication technology (ICT) sector. Speaking on the firm’s partnership with Ikoyi Obalende Local Council Development Area (LCDA) on community WiFi provision, he said millions of Nigerians have been shut out of cyberspace by high data prices in the country. He said: “With millions of Nigerians priced out of the data market by incumbent operators, we are pleased to partner the Ikoyi Obalende LCDA to provide a free and paid for service of internet to the residents of the LCDA; we believe that with our pricing that is clear, simple and transparent at N200 for 1GB of data without validity or expiration period, we are providing affordable internet access to people.” The Chairman of Ikoyi Obalende LCDA, Hon Faud Atanda-Lawal, said the partnership was pursuant to the realisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). He said: “We are pleased to partner the Fiam WiFi to provide a community WiFi network in Ikoyi Obalende LCDA.  WiFi hotspots will be installed in Obalende, Ijeh Market and Dolphin High Rise. This further drives my administration’s successes in our five focus areas of the UN SDG particularly Target 9c to significantly increase access to ICT and provide universal and affordable access to the internet.”
