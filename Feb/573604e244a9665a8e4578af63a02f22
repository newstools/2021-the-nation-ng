Nigerian Disc Jockey, DJ Cuppy has opened up on how lavish Owambe parties inspired her new song, ‘Litty Lit’. In a recent interview with a family-oriented TV channel, iVogue TV, Cuppy disclosed that coming into the country, she gets to experience the most amazing weddings and traditional parties, and the experience inspired her new song with Teni.  The 28-year old DJ said, “I’m not married myself, but I have always wanted to throw my own lavish oleku owambe party.” Continuing the daughter of Nigerian billionaire, Femi Otedola, said, “And so when I thought about a song with Teni and it’s all about getting lit and having a good time, this video was spot on. Teni worked in the studio, super vibrant, full of energy, ready to party. Actually, Teni really came through for me. Teni had been in a very stressful shoot that same day, but she came with the energy and she reassured me that we were going to make it, and that’s exactly what we did. Teni actually wasn’t feeling too well on that day so we had to push through. I was the one giving her the ginger. But I think it all came together and beautifully well.” Keying into the evolving digital space, iVogue TV was set up to break away from the norm by stemming fake news, bullying, one-sided stories, and epileptic blogging.
