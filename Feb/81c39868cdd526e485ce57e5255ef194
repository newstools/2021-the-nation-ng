Leaders of Ifon community in Ose Local Government of Ondo State have kicked against the invitation of some of its members by the police over the alleged killing of cows. The leaders said it was surprising to them that the police were pursuing supposed killers of cows when they were yet to unravel those who killed their traditional ruler, the Oluifon of Ifon, Oba Israel Adeusi. They said those invited were among the group of leaders temporarily holding the fort following the death of the monarch. The President of the Ifon Development Union, Chief Femi Awani, said at a news briefing in Ifon that the police invitation was based on a petition by one Abdulahi, who claimed that his cows were killed last month. He said another petition by one Alhaji Usman urged the police to deploy men from the FIB Tactical Command Squad to ensure that the invited leaders go to Abuja to answer to the petition. Awani noted that the thrust of the petition to the Force Headquarters was not only about killing of cows, but alleged criminal conspiracy, mischief, threat to life and attempted kidnapping. He said what aroused curiosity was that the content of the letter inviting the leaders was at variance with verbal narration of the policemen from Abuja. Awani appealed to Inspector General of Police Adamu Mohammed to investigate the authenticity of the letter, which they saw as a ploy to intimidate them and forestall attempts at protecting their land.
