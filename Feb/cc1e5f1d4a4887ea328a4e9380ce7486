The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit, (task force) on Wednesday seized 80 motorcycles for flouting the stateâ€™s traffic laws. Led by its Chairman, Shola Jejeloye, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), the task force has continued the raid on okada riders in Yaba axis. The state government had repeatedly warned okada riders to stop plying some restricted routes listed last year. Many motorcycles confiscated by the enforcement agency were loaded into a trailer. Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu said the raids on okada plying restricted routes would continue.  He said the goal of the state government and security agencies was to return sanity and safety to roads in the state. The government had lamented the increasing illegal operations of motorcycle riders within the metropolis, despite several warnings. A government official said the insurgency in some northern states led most of the people there migrating to Lagos and taking into okada business.
