In affirmation of its commitment to Nigerians, MTN Nigeria has supported over 2,000 retailers with ultra-modern kiosks as part of its “Kiosk as a Service” (KaaS) scheme. The scheme aims to uplift retailers across the country. The “Kiosk as a Service” scheme has been created to empower at least 2,000 retailers in Nigeria with solar-paneled kiosks. The modern kiosks are equipped with self-sufficient energy sources which enables the retailers to save on extra costs for energy consumption. Speaking on the laudable scheme, the Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, MTN Nigeria, Mr. Kunle Adebiyi, said, “The ‘Kiosk as a Service’ is a demonstration of MTN’s unwavering belief in partnership. We are empowering our retailers so that through this scheme, they can turn things up for themselves and in turn, the country. We are confident that this will empower thousands of Nigerians to become the much-needed drivers of the country’s economy because we believe that we can go far when we go together.”
