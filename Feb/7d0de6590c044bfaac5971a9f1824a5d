  Victor Osimhen has been given a clean bill of health after the Napoli striker suffered a head trauma in the final minutes of the Serie A tie against Atalanta at the weekend. In a club’s statement, Osimhen is expected to be observed by the team doctor at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo. “Victor Osimhen, following the injury with head trauma suffered in the final minutes of Atalanta-Napoli, underwent tests with negative results. “The player will remain in Bergamo until tomorrow (today) under the clinical observation of the blue health manager Raffaele Canonico,” the club stated. Meanwhile, Italian journalist Massimo Caputi has said that the Nigerian cannot solve the problems be-devilling the Italian side under Coach Gennaro Gattuso, adding Osimhen is relatively new to Serie A. Caputi told Tmw Radio :”I think Gattuso will not stay next year. Regardless of how many mistakes he may have made, he now has problems with the squad due to many injuries. What could he do more in Bergamo? The disappointment in Naples is great and justifiable, but for two months he has not had the most important forwards. Osimhen cannot solve all the problems, he is young and recently in Italy.” Also, Napoli has barred Gattuso and his players from giving interviews being the latest setback after last Thursday’s 2-0 Europa League defeat to Granada followed by Serie A 4-2 loss away to Atalanta at the weekend. This again piles more pressure on Gattuso, with reports increasing that he could be fired as Napoli is sliding on the Serie A standings with injuries   taking its toll on the squad.
