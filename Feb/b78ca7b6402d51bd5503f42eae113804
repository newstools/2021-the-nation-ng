An Abuja Mobile Court has convicted 33 persons, who were arrested and arraigned for not wearing facemasks in public places. The convicts were said to have violated the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Health Protection Regulation, 2021, as approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. Some of the violators who were convicted after pleading guilty to the charges read out by the prosecutor were fined N2,000 with an option of engaging in supervised community service. The Magistrate, Idayat Akanni, after counselling the convicts on the need to follow the COVID-19 protocols, noted that those who pleaded not guilty would be remanded in a correctional facility. She also allowed for those who pleaded not guilty to be bailed if they can meet the bail bond of N10,000. The Head, Media, Publicity and Enlightenment of the Taskforce, Comrade Ikharo Attah, vowed that the enforcement team will not be deterred in ensuring that COVID-19 is defeated within the nationâ€™s capital.
