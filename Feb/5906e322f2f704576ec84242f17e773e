 Wilfred Ndidi is poised to make another comeback after injury as the Nigerian returns to action for Leicester City in today’s FA Cup tie against Brighton & Hove Albion. Ndidi was not in action when Leicester played a goalless draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers at the weekend and coach Bredan Rodgers is hoping to have his defensive-minded midfielder back in the team. “Wilfred will be back for Wednesday’s (today) FA Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. We were thinking about this game [Wolverhampton Wanderers in the EPL] but we just felt we didn’t want to risk him,” Rodgers said during a post-match briefing at the weekend. Despite Hamza Choudhury’s and Papy Mendy’s success in applying themselves, in Ndidi’s absence Leicester failed to score yet keep a clean sheet in defence. The Nigerian who has been described as a great tackler or perceptive reader of the game with incredible attributes for an athlete in his position.
