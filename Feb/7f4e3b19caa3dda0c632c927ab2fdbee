Four persons have been arrested by the Joint Task Force of the Ondo Ministry of Natural Resources for cultivating Indian hemp inside Akure forest reserves. They were arrested for destroying economic trees for purpose of planting Indian hemp. The Director of the Joint Task Force in the Ministry, Alhaji Moshood Obadun, said the suspects were arrested after a tipoff. Commissioner for Natural resources, Idowu Otetubi, said encroachers of government forest reserves across the state would be arrested. He said the encroachers acted in defiance of the government directive that all illegal occupants should vacate forest reserves across the state. The Commissioner, who assured that those arrested would be charged to court, said there were rules of engagement in carrying out any activity in the forest reserves.
