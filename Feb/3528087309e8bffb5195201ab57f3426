  For the umpteenth time in the last one year, the 20th National Sports Festival tagged Edo 2020 has been moved to April from the planned February 14 kick off. The sports fiesta which has been postponed thrice in the past one year will now hold in April. According to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare, said the postponement became necessary following the second wave of COVID-19 sweeping across the country. Dare, made the disclosure yesterday at the media briefing by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19. He said: “We have seen the Sports Festival postponed three times. As we speak now most of us should have arrived in Edo state getting ready for February 14, Sunday to start the Edo 2020 Sports Festival. But flowing from our last meeting a few things came up. There was an undertone that the postponements have occasioned some financial difficulties and strains on the host state, and I dare say even on our part as the Ministry the postponements have also occasioned some financial difficulties. “ “I am glad to report that the Federal Government is favourably disposed to assisting Edo State to host the Festival. In the next few days, we hope to push through the document through the Ministry of Finance to get the financial support to get the Festival on track. “The February 14th date was not cast in stone as we wanted to avoid another postponement. But we must agree that the February 14th date is no longer feasible,” he added. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Main Organizing Committee and Edo State Deputy Governor Comrade Philip Shuaibu is equally optimistic: “I agree the Festival should be held before the Olympics to get our athletes fit and to secure points they require for the Olympics. Every postponement goes with a cost, but we are totally committed to hosting the festival. We are very expectant of the support of the Federal Government to make the Festival a reality.”
