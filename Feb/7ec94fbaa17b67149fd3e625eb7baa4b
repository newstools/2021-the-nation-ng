After opening his 2020/21 account in the Premier League in Leicester city 2-0 win over Fulham, Kelechi Iheanacho believes he would continue to work hard to have more chances of being listed in the starting line-up. The Super Eagles striker scored the opening goal through a header in the 17th minutes before James Justin finished a flowing team move to wrap up three points at Craven Cottage. Following his fourth goal in all competitions this term, Iheanacho says he will continue to work hard in training to earn more opportunities to showcase his abilities to manager Brendan Rodgers. “I’m always working in training. I need to work really hard to get my chance. Sometimes, the gaffer switches the team around, so I need to work for my chance. When it comes, I need to take it and that’s what I did tonight,” Iheanacho told LCFC TV. “Actually, I wasn’t expecting the header,” the former Manchester City forward added. “I got in the space between the two central defenders and I got the header, so I’m delighted. Ahead of a short trip across the Midlands to tackle Nuno Espírito Santo’s Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday, Iheanacho is excited by the challenge. “We’re looking forward to it,” he continued. “It will be a tough game, so we need to really work in training, stay together, and focus on the next game,” the Nigerian added.
