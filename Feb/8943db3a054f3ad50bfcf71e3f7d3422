 Enyimba Coach Fatai Osho has dismissed the newly re-grassed Port Harcourt stadium turf as bad. Osho who spoke moments after his club survived Rivers United in their CAF Confederation Cup clash on Sunday, saying  the pitch made things difficult for Enyimba. “I must be frank with you, the pitch made things difficult for us. We had to improvise…we just couldn’t play our game and back home in Aba we have a very fine pitch where any team can fully express itself. We came to Port Harcourt with a game plan   but we couldn’t execute because of the poor pitch…but the stadium itself is beautiful and deserves a better pitch,” Osho said. It will be recalled that the first leg in Aba was played after a heavy downpour but in spite of the rain, the pitch constructed by Monimichelle Group with a solid drainage system was ready and playable. Osho who was still basking in the euphoria of their victory was full of praise for his players especially goalkeeper John Noble who not only saved two penalties but converted the last kick that gave Enyimba victory.
