Despite denials by concerned parties, talk about alleged plans by former President Goodluck Jonathan to dump the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), and join the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), refuse to go away. The APC leadership had denied that talks are on to field Jonathan in the 2023 presidential election. The former president’s camp has also regularly debunked reports linking him with the move. But some pundits insist that indications are daily emerging linking Jonathan with APC, especially under the leadership of Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, who is chairman of the party’s caretaker committee. The latest addition to the tales is that Jonathan will seek the presidential ticket of the APC as part of the deal to get him join the party ahead of the 2023 elections. So rife is the new tale that Buni had to, once again, deny the reports. He ‘cleared’ the air while leaving a window of opportunity. In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Hausa Service on Wednesday, he denied APC governors had endorsed Jonathan for 2023. He, however, said it would be a ‘new discussion entirely’ whether Jonathan would be welcome if he eventually indicates interest. Some observers say this is one denial that’s bound to keep the rumour mills engaged, rather than silence them.
