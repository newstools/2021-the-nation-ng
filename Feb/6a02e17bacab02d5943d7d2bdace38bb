 Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has praised the impact of Wilfred Ndidi on his side’s 3-1 win over Liverpool at the weekend. The Foxes handed the Reds a third straight Premier League defeat and effectively ended their hopes of retaining the title with a come-from-behind triumph at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. “All the stats show you when he (Ndidi) plays for us the difference he makes, and for him even to get an assist for the third goal was very pleasing,” said the Foxes manager after the match. “But at the highest level of the game you need someone who can recover you the ball, especially when you’ve talented players and he’s one of the best in the Premier League at that, so he was colossal today for us, and he really typified a really good team performance,” Rodgers added. Ndidi has made 12 Premier League appearances in the 2020-21 season, registering one goal, one assist and two yellow cards.
