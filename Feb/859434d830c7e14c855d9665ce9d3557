A 40-year-old ritualist named Adeboye Moshood was arrested with human parts on Tuesday by Joint Task Force. It was gathered Moshood on Tuesday morning brought a sack that contained what was not known to his neighbours into the house at Gbayarin area near Ayepe market in Gbongan, Ayedaade Local Government Area, Osun State. When he entered the house strong and offensive odour rented the atmosphere and it raised a suspicion in the house.  It was learnt he was challenged by some of the residents but he denied them answer to their questions. He further took the sack from the house and hid it in a nearby bush in his house. But the residents reported the matter to the officers of JTF around the area. Subsequently, they discovered that the sack he was hiding contained human parts and was arrested. Moshood was paraded at the Osun State Police Command, Osogbo with the human parts; two legs and other flesh. Speaking to newsmen, Moshood, said: “I went to Modakeke on Monday and while I was coming, I stop by at Iwaro I saw a corpse. I reasoned that some parts will be useful for me then I cut them out for money ritual.” The Commissioner of Police, Mr Olokode Olawale, vowed he will not make Osun State be a haven for criminals. Other suspects paraded are three staff of a company, Oyebajo Sunday, 20, Oludokun Damola, 27, Olaniyi Hakeem, 29 and Chimeze Umeh, 38, who was arrested for conspiracy and stealing of truck loaded with 20 water pipes worth N3.5millon on February 7, 2021, belonging to Thomas Chase Company, Ilesa.
