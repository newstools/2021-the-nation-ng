The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has applauded President Muhammadu Buhari for walking the talk as the country exits another economic recession despite global economic downturn. Buhari had in the last quarter of 2020 promised to exit the country from another economic recession within a short time. The ruling party in a statement by the Secretary, Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe in Abuja on Thursday, commended the President for keeping to his promise. It said: “The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report of Nigeria’s exit from recession in the fourth quarter of 2020 gives credence to the fact that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government walks the talk on its promises to Nigerians and Next Level plans for the country. “President Buhari promised Nigeria will exit economic recession within a short time. That promise has been kept. “Commendably, Nigeria’s exit from recession is the country’s first growth in three quarters amid the coronavirus restrictions and consequent economic slowdown. “It was not a fluke but as a result of well-planned measures lined up by the federal government to ensure a quick exit. “The early exit was as a result of among others the successful implementation of the Federal Government’s Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) which ensured reflating and stimulating of the economy to prevent business collapse; retaining and creating jobs through support to labour intensive sectors such as agriculture and direct labour interventions; infrastructural investments in roads, rails, bridges; promoting manufacturing and local production as a way of creating job opportunities and pro-poor spending and other social investments targeting the very poor and other vulnerable groups.” The party also commended other stakeholders, particularly the National Assembly, private sector and Nigerians for supporting economic initiatives implemented by Buhari government to exit recession.
