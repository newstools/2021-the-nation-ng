Sadio Mane has conceded that Liverpool can no longer win the Premier League and their main target now is to win the Champions League. Liverpool ripped up the record books last season on the way to their first English top-flight title in 30 years, but a season marred by injuries and poor form has left them sixth and trailing leaders Manchester City by 19 points. And while Mane insists he and his team-mates will be sticking to the ‘never give up’ mantra, the gap to catch City is far too big – especially with how dominant the table-toppers are looking at this moment. “Our target from the beginning was the Champions League, the Premier League and also cup games. And now, I can say it’s over for the Premier League… it’s too much,” Mane told ESPN. “In our head, it’s always “never give up” and we won’t give up, but for sure, City are a good team and they’re flying.”
