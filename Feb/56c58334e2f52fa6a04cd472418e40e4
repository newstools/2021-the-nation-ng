Romelu Lukaku has scored in the opening minute of two Serie A matches this season, the first player to do that in one campaign since 1999-2000 Serie A leaders Inter Milan beat Genoa thanks to goals from three former Manchester United players. Romelu Lukaku opened the scoring after only 32 seconds with a surging run and finish from the edge of the box, his 18th league goal of the season. He then set up Matteo Darmian to drill home Inter’s second. Alexis Sanchez headed in the third, with his first touch since coming off the bench, after Lukaku’s shot was saved. Inter are seven points above AC Milan, who visit Roma at 19:45pm.
