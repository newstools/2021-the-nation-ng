 But the Saints gifted Chelsea an equaliser eight minutes after the break when Danny Ings brought down Mason Mount inside the box and the Blues midfielder stepped up to send Alex McCarthy the wrong way from the penalty spot. Chelsea were unable to kick on after that and instead it was Southampton who went closest to grabbing a winner as Jannik Vestergaard hit the crossbar with a header before Ings put the loose ball into the side-netting. However, Saints manager Hasenhuttl was satisfied with a positive result in light of their recent torrid run. “A draw feels like a win,” he said. “It’s a step towards us returning to our normal form.” “We are believing in what we are doing. The Premier League is tough. For us, it is good that we take a point from such a strong side.” The point left Chelsea in fourth place on 43 points with Southampton 13th on 30 points. (BBCSports)
