 With so many businesses being forced to pilot their operations to compete in changing markets, the Chief Executive, Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI), Dr Olufemi Oladunni, has called for innovations’revamp to enable universities enterprise and innovation units to launch programmes to identify vital skills gaps, aiming to produce a new generation of post-COVID entrepreneurs. Speaking with The Nation, Oladunni said the pandemic has reshaped the economic landscape and institutions have to support the next generation of entrepreneurs to help lead future economic growth. He added that every efforts must be made to enable youths capitalise on the “unprecedented opportunity” offered by the COVID-19 pandemic to transform thel economic landscape. According to him, the government has to support local export firms to expand their contributions to the nation’s gross domestic product as efficiency, export capacity and investments improve. The President, Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Dr Femi Egbesola, said there were “huge opportunities” within the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) that present a major opportunity for African countries to bring out of millions of people out of extreme poverty, adding that there was the need for state guarantees to encourage exports and investments, help minimise political and commercial risks, and raise export financing for the mid- and long-term. Egbesola said micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) needed new financing to help them to become more competitive and seize new export opportunities. This, according to him, will allow businesses to invest in the modernisation of their equipment and production processes to international standards in product quality, health and safety measures and environmental preservation. Ensuring high product standards, he added, allows companies to become more export-oriented and trade their goods widely, while also making them more competitive on the local market. He said MSMEs will be willing to join forces in the creation of structuring solutions to allow the development of its members internationally and that the sector will witness growth if there was a business development initiative to promote diversification of the markets of exporting companies.
