Northern Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has expressed concerns on the alleged constant attacks against northerners, especially recent attack in Sasha market of Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo. A statement from its spokesman, Mock Kure, said: “The attention of the Northern Youths Council of Nigeria has been drawn to the ongoing Carnage against Northerners, particularly in Sasha Market of Akinyele Local Government, Oyo State, South West Nigeria wherein so many lives were either killed or injured, business premises and vehicles were burnt by Yoruba hoodlums. “We wish to condemn such an attack in the strongest terms possible and call on security agents to arrest the perpetrators so as to serve as deterrent to would be hoodlums.” The Arewa youths noted the hidden agenda to expel northerners in the region started with calls on all herdsmen by Ondo Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, to leave Forests Reserves. The youths noted: “The eviction orders violate the provisions of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999 as amended) which guarantees freedom of movement to all citizens and rights to own movable and unmovable properties in any part of the country. “We believe strongly that the inability of the government at all levels to tame the lawless wings of Sunday Igboho and his co-travellers has led to the emergence of his variants, hence, the renewed attacks on settled business people and many others that can’t speak Yoruba at Sasha Market,” the statement explained. The youth called on the federal government to declare Sunday Igboho’s group a terrorist organisation as he is not different from Boko Haram.
