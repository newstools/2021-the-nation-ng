A GoFundMe campaign has been launched for Sunday Adeyemo, a Yoruba activist better known as Sunday Igboho to support his campaign against killer herdsmen. The Nation learnt the campaign was launched by one Maureen Badejo, based in the United Kingdom for “purchase of buses for Sunday Igboho”. The GoFundMe page is meant to help raise £100,000 (N51.8m). “Let us rise up and support chief Sunday Adeyemo Igboho, they need buses to move around to secure our ancestral land. “Our security is threatened as we speak. It seems people in a position of authority are helpless,” the description read in part. Checks by TheNation on the GoFundMe website on early Saturday, showed that 832 donors have contributed to the campaign. As of the last check early Saturday, £27,310 (N14m) has been donated. Igboho during a virtual town hall meeting, said he needs buses to “transport people” for his south-west tour. Sunday Igboho had said he would embark on a tour of Southwest states of Nigeria in a bid to flush out killer herdsmen in the region. So far, he has been in Oyo and Ogun states.
