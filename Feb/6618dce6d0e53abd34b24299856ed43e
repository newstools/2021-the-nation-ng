The Imo State Government yesterday recovered Royal Palm Estate on Akachi Road, Owerri belonging to Nkechi Okorocha, wife of former governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha. The seizure was in compliance with the directive of the Imo State gazette on the report of the Judicial Commission of Enquiry on recovery of lands and other related matters. The Commissioner for Lands, Enyinnaya Onuegbu, who led the team that took the estate allegedly acquired by the ex governor’s wife yesterday evening, said the government had sealed up the place till further notice. ”This is as a result of the recommendation of the commission that all illegal lands and structures acquired by the administrations between 2006 and 2019 should be taken over by the government,” Onuegbu said. He said the current administration is therefore not resting on its oars in recovering all the stolen properties of the state especially those carted away by the previous administration. The commissioner added that in line with the 3Rs mantra initiative of Governor Hope Uzodimma, the state must continue to work in line with the relevant laws and recommendations of government agencies and commissions no matter whose ox is gored. It will be recalled that the Judicial Commission of Enquiry on Recovery of Lands and Other Related Matters was one out of the many panels constituted by the Emeka Ihedioha’s administration whose recommendations Governor  Uzodimma  has adopted.
