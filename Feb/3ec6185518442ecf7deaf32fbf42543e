 Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo may have given hint about the jersey number he might put on at Saudi Pro League club Al-Shabab. The 31-year-old reportedly underwent his medicals on Tuesday ahead off a two-and-a-half year deal after Shanghai Greenland Shenhua had given him permission to speak to the Saudi Arabian side. But yesterday, Ighalo displayed a picture on one of his social media status with number 25 boldly handwritten apparently on beach sand. Incidentally, the 2019 African Cup of Nations top scorer wore jersey number 25 previously worn by Antonio Valencia during his long loan spell at Manchester United , saying then that his favourite jersey numbers were not available to him at Old Trafford. “No.19 was available because, when I was at Watford, I put on 24. No.24 is not available. In Shanghai no.9, it’s not available, so I said 24 + 1 is 25, so I said okay, let me go for 25 instead of 19,” hinted Ighalo. “ So I said 25 is good even though I didn’t get the number I was looking for. “Twenty-five is a perfect number. One above what I wore before when I was in the Premier League.” He was initially due to return to China following 12 months at Manchester United, who he joined on-loan from Greenland Shenhua in January last year. He scored five goals in 23 appearances for the Red Devils and penned an emotional goodbye upon his departure from Old Trafford, having lived his boyhood dream. In his typical fashion, Ighalo last night seemed to be in boisterous mood over his present status with bursts of Christian gospel songs, saying ‘no Jupiter can stop what God has decided to do.” Yet Ighalo is set for unveiling in the coming days. The Riyadh-based club currently occupy top spot on the Pro League standings and boast of former Sevilla midfielder Ever Banega on their books, as well as Senegal international Alfred N’Diaye.
