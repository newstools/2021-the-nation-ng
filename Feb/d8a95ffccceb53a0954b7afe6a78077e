 After bagging Man of the Match award in Rangers’ 2-0 bashing of Dundee United in the Scottish Premier League (SPL) at the weekend, Joe Aribo is focusing on helping his team secure a place in the last 16 of the  Europa League. The Super Eagles midfielder attributed his present form to hardwork and support from teammates. Rangers defeated Royal Antwerp of Belgium 4-3 away and they are expected to host the Belgian side on Thursday in the second leg tie. “It’s a big game and it’s knockout football. We know what we have to do and we just have to focus, get ready, dust ourselves off and move on to that,” Aribo told RangersTV. He however, said that Rangers would need to finish up the league on a high with three wins from clinching their 55th title in the SPL. “I just want to finish the season strong, keep pushing, keep going and giving all that I can and I am happy that I’m getting positive results.” Rangers’ coach Steven Gerrard was full of praise for Aribo as he put in another strong performance and topped it off with a superb second-half goal. “It was a fantastic strike, he is really back now. He was out for a long time, it was his first injury in his career and he had an illness on the back of that so it took him quite some time to get right back in the groove. “He was fantastic today, not just the goal but his running power, his quick feet and the way he outplays people. He is a fantastic kid, you can’t get him off the training pitch, he’s always working on his game,” the Liverpool legend said. He added: “He decided to come to Rangers to develop and grow and he is certainly moving in the right direction. There’s no surprise that he is getting a lot of good performances in his game right now.”
