US-BASED Nigerian musician Adeyinka Hazzan aka Yinka Rhythmz has revealed that his newly released album, “Gracefully Appointed” was inspired by his encounter with people and his life in general. “Gracefully Appointed album was written around 2014, 2015, and 2016. It was recorded in the mid-year of 2016 but due to my busy schedules and activities, it was so difficult for the producers to finalise the album. But after some tweaks and readjustment of schedules. God gave me the leeway for it to be completed. My inspiration comes from my daily experiences, my failed relationships, and life in general,” he said. Yinka Rhythmz said he has been working on the album since 2014 but was released in 2021, which he believes is the appointed time by God. “It was not easy putting up the album but I was determined to make it happen. “I write/record voicenote of song composition anytime I am driving, and the inspiration comes, I will find somewhere to pull over. Sometimes when I get home late at night relaxing and reminiscing about my daily activities, the inspiration comes and I put the music down.”
