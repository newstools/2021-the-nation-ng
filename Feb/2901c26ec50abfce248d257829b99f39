The IREDE Foundation recently paid an advocacy visit to the Lagos State Office for Disability Affairs (LASODA) and the Lagos State Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget (MEPB), to kick off a Disability Rights Fund (DRF) funded project, “The United for Inclusive Education (UIE).” The advocacy project is geared at promoting inclusive and quality education for children with disabilities so that no child is left behind in Lagos schools. The project will be delivered by a coalition of Children Development Centre, Festus Fajemilo Foundation and The IREDE Foundation. According to the Head of Operations, Wuraola Kayode, “We have the commitment of LASODA and MEPB towards the success of this project.” The IREDE Foundation was founded in 2012, borne out of the Founder, Crystal Chigbu’s personal experience. Crystal and Azubuike Chigbu had their first child who was discovered at birth to have a medical condition called ‘Tibial Hemimelia’. Subsequently, she launched and incorporated the foundation which was named ‘Irede’ after her daughter meaning ‘Goodness has come.’
