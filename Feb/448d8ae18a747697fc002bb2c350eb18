The Senate on Tuesday adjourned plenary sitting in honour of late House of Representatives Member, Hon. Ossy Prestige. This is even as Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, expressed “shock and sadness” over the death of Prestige. Hon. Prestige represented Aba North/Aba South Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives. He was elected into the House in 2015 and re-elected in 2019. Lawan in a statement by his Special Adviser (Media), Ola Awoniyi, in Abuja, said that the departed lawmaker would be sorely missed by all his colleagues in the National Assembly. The Senate President said that Hon. Prestige was a good representative of his constituency in the National Assembly who touched many lives through his business engagements and charity outreach such as the Prestige Ossy Foundation and The Favoured Initiatives. Lawan commiserated with his family, friends and political associates over his irreparable loss. He also condoled with the Government and people of Abia State and prayed that God would grant them the fortitude to bear the loss.
