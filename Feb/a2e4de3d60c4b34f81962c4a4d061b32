One of the leading governorship aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress APC, Senator Andy Uba, says his 2007 campaign will be a child’s play if his party gives him the governorship ticket He said Tuesday that his amazing campaigns in that year’s governorship election in all the 326 wards and 21 local government areas in Anambra gave him overwhelming victory during the election. The record, according to him had not been equalled by any governorship candidate in the State to date, adding that the APC campaign for the November 6 election in Anambra State would be taking to another level. The Senator, who represented Anambra South, Senatorial zone, while speaking in Awka, said it was the same promise he had earlier made during an APC southeast stakeholders meeting in Awka a fortnight ago. The former Presidential aide and two terms Senator, who won the 2007 governorship election in the state with a massive majority, promised to surpass his unprecedented campaign of 2007 if he picked the party’s governorship ticket. It could be recalled that while his opponents in the election were satisfied with breezing visits to the metropolitan cities of Awka, Onitsha, Nnewi and a few towns along major roads, Andy Uba carried his message of “paradigm shift” to dusty villages and hamlets in the State. Uba said, ” I will never engage in name-calling and will not spend time sulking, but I will be busy discussing issues with voters in Anambra’s 326 wards, Communities and local government areas that I will personally. He assured that he would use his experience and work together with his Party members and the people of the State to reclaim and reactivate God’s master plan for Ndi Anambra. The APC aspirant further declared that his party was ready and willing to end the sufferings of the people in 2021, adding, “the battle has just begun.”
