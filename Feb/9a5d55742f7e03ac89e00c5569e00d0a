A group, Kwara South Vision, has decried what it called underdevelopment of Kwara South Senatorial District.It lamented the over 20 years of the area’s worrisome and unacceptable socio-economic and political underdevelopment. A statement by the group’s General Secretary, Elder Wale Soladoye,said the body, at its inaugural meeting in Ajasse-Ipo, the headquarters of the senatorial district, noted that it was determined to reverse the ugly situation by mobilising people in the 83 wards that make up the senatorial district towards choosing and electing the right people to represent them in future elections. The meeting, attended by personalities and representatives from the seven local governments in Kwara South, also deliberated on topical issues geared towards enhancing the socio-economic and political development of the district.” The group reviewed the socio-economic and political development of Kwara South District in the past 20 years and concluded that there was nothing to write home about.”The body, among other things, pledged to consult with stakeholders in the district to ensure unity of purpose towards achieving the developmental goals,” the statement said. Kwara South Vision said it had received with concern and apprehension, the news of the influx of herdsmen running from Oyo and Osun states into Kwara South. The apprehension, the group said, is predicated on stories of wanton destruction and callousness the marauders have perpetrated in the two states and elsewhere around the country. The body, therefore, called for vigilance and cooperation by the people to ensure that no mayhem is unleashed on the people and their means of livelihood. It urged security agencies to be on top of the worrisome situation.
