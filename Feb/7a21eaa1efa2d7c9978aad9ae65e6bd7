Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel believes on-loan defender Fikayo Tomori has “high potential”, but admitted he “has not spent much time thinking about him” since moving to the club. Tomori, 23, joined Milan on loan for the rest of the season in the January transfer window. The Italian club have the option to make the deal permanent for £25 million plus add-on payments. Tuchel, who was speaking ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League match against Southampton on Saturday, spoke positively about Tomori gaining experience in a “different culture” but said he had had little time to consider whether the defender will ever be a part of his plans. “To be very honest, I have not spent too many minutes thinking about Tomori,” Tuchel said on Friday. “Not because I don’t like him or I don’t see his potential but because there was simply not time. “It’s always the target for me to have players who can make it in different circumstances, who can show their qualities in different cultures and different clubs. “We will have this talk in the next weeks and months about all the guys who are on loan. Of course, I have a general impression of Tomori which means that he has high potential but I’m not into all the details right now.”
