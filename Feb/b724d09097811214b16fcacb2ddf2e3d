 Nigerians are still basking in the euphoria of the return of the National Principal’s Cup in the country as two of the competition’s ambassadors, Joseph Dosu and Tajudeen Disu were both excited with the preparation of some of the teams expected to take part in the competition. Speaking in Lagos during a visit to one of the traditional schools who had excelled in the championship, Igbobi College, Lagos, the two ex-internationals said the return of the Principal’s Cup would help to return the lost glory of the country in youth football. Dosu, who was a product of Igbobi College, said it was great for him to return to the school where he made his mark. “It’s great for me to come back to this school. Immediately I was informed about coming to see the boys, I have been looking forward to it,” the Atlanta 1996 Olympics Gold medalist said. “Returning to the school after so many years, the memories came back, and it was nice seeing the chaps that would be representing Igbobi College in the next Principal’s Cup.” On his part, Disu said it was a big disappointment for most of them when the competition was in limbo, expressing joy over the return of  the Principal’s Cup as Igbobi College prepare for the opening game against Government College of Kaduna on February 12 at the Onikan Stadium, Lagos. Meanwhile, the organisers of the Principal’s Cup will be paying a courtesy visit to the paramount ruler of Ife, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, on Monday (today). The aim of the visit is to seek for royal blessing as the opening ceremony gets closer.
