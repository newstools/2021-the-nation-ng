The Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) has said private universities, polytechnics and colleges of education have started accessing the N7.5 billion National Research Fund (NRF). The agency said the funds would bolster the conduct of cutting-edge researches in tertiary institutions. TETFund’s Executive Secretary, Prof. Suleiman Bogoro, announced this on Monday while declaring open a four-day meeting of the agency’s Research and Development Standing Committee (RDSC). He said the breakthrough came two years after the Board of Trustees (BoT) approved that private institutions could draw from the funds. Bogoro recalled that since the inauguration of TETFund’s RDSC on September 24, 2020, the committee had gone far in implementing President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive to support government initiatives of responding to the threat of COVID-19 through ground-breaking research on phyto-medical drugs, prophylactics and vaccines. The TETFund boss added that some results of the fund’s intervention would be announced soon.
