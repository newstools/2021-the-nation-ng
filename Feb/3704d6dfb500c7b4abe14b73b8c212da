Popular Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho on Monday declared war on killer herdsmen during a visit to some parts of Ogun. Igboho had a brief stopover in Abeokuta around 4pm where he interacted with supporters. He proceeded to Ketuland where some soldiers allegedly connived with herdsmen to flog farmers for not permitting them to graze their cattle in Yewa-North Local Government Area. In Abeokuta, the activist said: “I observe there is an injustice from the herdsmen because they know the power that they have in the Federal Government. “So, they behave as if Yoruba people are nobody. They kill our people, they kidnap our people, and they rape our women.” “Any herdsman who engages in kidnapping would be flushed out.” He declared he would not limit his activism to Igangan, saying “Not only Igangan, we are going to visit all Yorubaland and ensure there is peace everywhere.” The activist lauded Governor Dapo Abiodun for allowing him in the state. Special Adviser on Public Communications to Abiodun, Remmy Hazzan, had said Igboho was free to come to the state for consultation. Appreciating the gesture, the activist said: “We have not visited the Governor, we will do that after we have flushed the Fulani herdsmen out of the state. “I am going to Yewa because that is where the Fulani are wreaking havoc.”
