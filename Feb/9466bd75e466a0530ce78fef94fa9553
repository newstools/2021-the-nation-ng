 Women Football League players and officials in the Premiership clubs from the dreaded Corona-Virus, Action resumes again today in the Nigerian Women Football League after a one-month break due to COVID-19 related issues. Matches are lined up across the country in various designated venues with Delta Queens hosting league leaders Bayelsa Queens in the undoubtedly match-of- the-week game at the Agbor Township Stadium, Delta State in a Week 5 cracker. Delta Queens who are sixth on the league table with just six points from four matches, will mostly likely face a difficult task against league leaders armed with 12 points after winning all four matches played so far at home and away grounds, scoring seven goals and conceding three goals with a Â±4 goal difference. Delta Queens despite playing at home, would have their hands full trying to stop the four scoring machines in Bayelsa Queens; Anjor Mary (2 goals), Joy Bokiri (1 goal), Reuben Charity (1goal), and Joy Jerry (2 goals) from wrecking any havoc on their team.
