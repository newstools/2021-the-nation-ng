If reports reaching Sentry from are anything to go by, then Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has been under intense pressure over his position that north to south cattle movement should be banned by the Federal Government. But sources say he’s unwilling to change his position. The governor while canvassing enactment of a law to ban movement of cattle from the North to other parts of the country said this would resolve incessant clashes between farmers and herders. Ganduje who made the call in Daura, Katsina, after he and other APC governors met with President Muhammadu Buhari, emphasised that banning the movement of herders from the North to other parts of the country will also address the challenge of cattle rustling. Sentry gathered that some prominent individuals and groups in the north had promptly condemned the governor’s position, claiming the timing was wrong given what they called the unlawful activities of Sunday Igboho in the Southwest as regards farmers/herders clashes in Yorubaland. The social media, especially among northern users, is also chock full with condemnation and anger over Ganduje’s position, with many accusing him of siding with anti-Fulani activists. But sources close to the governor say he is unmoved and insists his suggestions remain the best in the interest of everybody. “Go and read his submissions. He is suggesting a permanent solution to the problem and some people are complaining, and you ask me if he is worried. Over what? He is not moved. He is building RUGA here in Kano. If herdsmen continue to go to Lagos and Saki, who will stay in the RUGA here? That is just the simple explanation you need,” a close ally of the governor told Sentry on Wednesday.
