The Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA) has said the blue and red rail lines will be operational by December 2022. General Manager Mrs. Abimbola Akinajo, speaking yesterday when officials of the Office of Transformation, Creativity and Innovation (Office of Head of Service) visited her, said LAMATA was working to ensure the rail lines were delivered in December. She said: “These two lines will change the transport landscape of Lagos when operational. We have a transport master plan, which speaks to the vision of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on transportation. “We have six rail lines and one monorail, 14 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridors, over 20 water routes. We are sure that when these are harnessed, Lagos will join the league of cities with an efficient transport system. “We have advertised four other rail lines for the private sector to invest in. We are working with the private sector to bring in about 1,500 high capacity buses by 2022. We will launch our first mile last mile scheme soon. We are working on the construction of two interchanges at Mile 2 and CMS. We want to ensure that Lagosians travel in comfort.”
