A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State, Alex Otti, has urged party members to shun divisiveness and double standard. Otti spoke at his Umuru, Nvosi country home in Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area, when he hosted the enlarged APC executive, including the State Working Committee, the 17 council chairmen and other state officials. The party chief insisted that APC must live up to its billing by fearlessly and responsibly condemning anti-people vices, and demand for good governance ‘which is what Abians yearn for’. According to Otti, anyone who believes the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is getting it right has no business being in APC or pretending to be working to change the government of the day. Otti, who was the 2015 and 2019 gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), restated that he joined the APC wholly, leaving nothing in his former party. He urged members and supporters to support the Donatus Nwankpa leadership for greater work, especially at the grassroots ‘where the party needs to do more work’. Nwankpa described Otti as a huge asset which the APC is very proud to have in its fold. He described the APC as a progressive party on a progressive and consistent rise to prominence.
