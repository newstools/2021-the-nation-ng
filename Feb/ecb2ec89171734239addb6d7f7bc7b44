General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye has joined calls for release of all captives, including Leah Sharibu after three years of captivity by Boko Haram insurgents.
In a paragraph memo titled “Call for release of Leah Sharibu”, Adeboye gave some directives to church leaders and Christian parents. According to the brief letter he personally signed, Adeboye directed pastors to intensify prayers for immediate release of captives, including the teenage Leah Sharibu who is suffering her third year in captivity. He directed them: “I hereby again, call and direct all Pastors in The Redeemed Christian Church of God, all over the world, not to stop but to intensify their prayers for the release of Leah Sharibu. “I also call on every parent, all over the world, to use whatever influence they have, to ensure that Leah Sharibu, as well as other children in captivity, is released,” Pastor Adeboye emphasised. He assured: “We shall not relent in our prayers” for the captives including the school children that were abducted recently in Niger State by the fundamentals.”
