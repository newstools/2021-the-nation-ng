The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has threatened to shut the popular Bannex plaza and EFAB mall if owners of shops continue to flout the COVID-19 Health Protection Regulations, 2021. Head, Media, Enlightenment and Publicity of the Task Force, Comrade Ikharo Attah, said the warning has become necessary following the flagrant violation of COVID-19 protocols observed in both Bannex plaza and EFAB mall. Attah, who spoke with reporters after a sitting of the FCT mobile court, stated that most of the offenders brought before the court were picked up from the two places even as he observed that the affected facilities were found not to have provisions for washing points or temperature machines at theirÂ  entry points. The 47 persons tried before the mobile court for not wearing face mask pleaded guilty and were given a N2,000 fine or an option of community service.
