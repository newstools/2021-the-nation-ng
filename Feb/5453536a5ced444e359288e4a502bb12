Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare has condoled with the Sport Writers Association  of Nigeria, Abuja Chapter  and  the family  of  Segun Ogunjimi over his death. The Nigerian Football family has once more been thrown into deep mourning following the demise on Wednesday of ace sports journalist Olusegun Ogunjimi of The Nation newspapers stable. Highly professional, resourceful, humble and diligent, Ogunjimi was widely respected by colleagues, administrators and other stakeholders in the sector, and was a credible role model for aspiring newshounds. The minister said: “I received the  news of Segun Ogunjimi’s  death with utmost  shock and sadness in my heart. He was not just a dedicated  journalist, but someone I knew personally  because of his zeal and commitment  to the activities  of the Ministry. “ He was so passionate  about his job, full of life and vigour. He was one of the few  journalists I took personal note of on assuming office due to his unrivalled professionalism  and dedication to duty. “ I commiserate with his wife, son, extended family and the entire  SWAN members  on this sad  incident. My  prayer is  that God grants  the family and the  sports community the fortitude to bear this huge loss. May his soul rest in peace.” Remarked NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi: “We lost a very good friend. He was objective and unbiased in his journalism. He cross-checked and balanced his stories before reporting. May God be the guide to those he left behind,” A veteran of the trade who learnt from some of the very best and imbibed and internalised the good old ethics and tenets of journalism, Ogunjimi served as treasurer of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria, FCT chapter and was Liaison Assistant of SWAN President Honour Sirawoo. He covered several national and international sporting events during his lifetime.
