A yet-to-be-identified graduating student of Delta State Polytechnic, Oghara, Ethiope East council area of the state, reportedly died in a lone car accident, Friday. It was learnt that the incident happened along Ovade Road, in the polytechnic town, due to over-speeding. It was not clear how the crash occurred, but the victim appeared to have been flung out of the car when it somersaulted. The deceased would have graduated that very day, reports claim. A video of the accident scene showed an irreparable damaged Toyota Camry vehicle. When contacted, the spokesperson of the Delta State Police Command confirmed the incident. “It was a lone motor accident. The vehicle seems to have failed brake, ran into the bush and somersaulted. He died,” the PPRO said.
