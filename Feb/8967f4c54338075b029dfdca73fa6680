 TWENTY years after the evergreen single, ‘One Day Ego Better’, member of the defunct group, “Safari”, Mike Nliam, has returned to the music stage to honour late Fela Anikulapo Kuti. The honour from Nliam is coming in the way of a debut single entitled ‘Just Like Fela’. The new song is a classic afro-pop with Afrobeat tunes and laced with blazing trumpet horns, heavy bass guitar strings, and drum kicks. ‘Just Like Fela’, is the first song off Mike Nliam’s new 7-track EP due out in the coming weeks. The song, which was produced by Dr. Kris Okoro, was released alongside a music video on February 9. Mike who gave a five-star performance in the music video, gave an insight into how the song came about. “A couple of years ago, I watched a video by ‘Maroon 5’ titled ‘Move Like Jagger’, and immediately, I was motivated to write a song in honor of the legendary Fela. I am a diehard fan of his. During writing, the catchy chorus was the first I penned before the verses,” Nliam said. Nliam’s new song has interestingly reunited him with Abay Esho, the second member of the defunct group known as Safari. Esho takes on the role of the video director for the song “Just like Fela.”
