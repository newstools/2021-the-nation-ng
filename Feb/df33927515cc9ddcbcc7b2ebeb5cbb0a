Proceedings at the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Enquiry and Restitution for Victims of SARS related abuses and other matters degenerated to a shouting match following its decision to return the Lekki Toll Gate plaza to its owners, the Lekki Concession Company (LCC). The plaza has been under the control of the panel since it began sitting in October following the #EndSARS protests. Justice Doris Okuwobi, sitting with only four out of the total nine members of the panel granted LCC permission to repossess the plaza after taking arguments for and against the application made by counsel to the LCC Ltd, Demola Seriki for the re-opening of the facility. The other four members who sat with Justice Okuwobi are Segun Awosanya( Popularly known as Segalink), Oluwatoyin Odusanya (Director, Citizens right), DIG Taiwo Lakanu ( representing the police) and Lucas Koyejo (from the National Human Rights Commission). Following her decision, the judge emeritus and her team rose, as the other absent members walked in and proceeded to deliver their dissenting ruling. The dissenters are: Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Mr Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, representing the Civil Society, Ms. Patience Udoh representing the Civil Society, Rinu Oduala and Temitope Majekodunmi, representing #EndSARS protesters. Their intention to read their dissenting ruling was interrupted by LCC lawyer, Mr Rotimi Seriki and Lagos State Counsel, Mr Enitan Thomas following which a shouting match ensued.
