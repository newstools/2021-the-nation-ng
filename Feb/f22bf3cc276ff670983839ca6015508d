Respite came the way of two prisoners, who were serving separate jail sentences at the Otukpo Correctional Centre on Tuesday, as Benue State Deputy Governor, Engr. Benson Abounu  paid their court fines enabling them to regain their freedom. The prisoners, Ojeka Jerry, from  Oju Local Government Area and  Daniel Ikoro from Obi Local Government Area, had approached the Deputy Governor who was on inspection  tour of the Och’Idoma palace and pleaded with him to come to their rescue. Abounu then asked why they were in prison, to which they replied that they separately bought items believed to have been stolen, for which they were convicted. While Ojeka Jerry who said he had served 1-year of his 4-years prison sentence bought foodstuff, Daniel Ikoro said he bought two pairs of jeans, said to have been stolen by the seller. The Deputy Governor then gave the fine money to the Otukpo Local Government Chairman, Rt. Hon. George Alli, which was later given to the Correctional Officer guarding them, Mr. Usman Hussein, for the payment to be made for their immediate release. Abounu then advised the two to stay off all forms of criminal activities and engage themselves in meaningful activities so they can be useful to themselves and the society. The two lucky prisoners, who were doing some work outside the prison yard,  thanked the deputy governor for coming to their rescue and prayed to God to bless him.
