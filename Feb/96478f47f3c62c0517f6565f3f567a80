 Following the successful surgery on his groin, Samuel Chukwueze is expected to resume light training on March 7 according to Soccerway. With this development the winger may be out of Super Eaglesâ€™ next month AFCON 2021 qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho slated for March 22 and 30. Chukwueze was operated on by renowned Doctor Ulrike Muschaweck in Munich, Germany last Thursday. This season, the attacker has only featured in 22 games in all competitions scoring two goals and with five assists for Villarreal. His possible omission from Eagles will be a minus for head coach Gernot Rohr who is aware Nigeria could still risk not participating in the 2021 AFCON if the team fails to secure at least three points from the remaining two games. Nigeria are currently on top of the Group L qualifiers with eight points from four games but they play Benin Republic who are second and a point behind Eagles whom they host next in Cotonou.
