President Muhammadu Buhari has cautioned Governos against the policy of amnesty for bandits. He stated that rewarding bandits with money and vehicles by some States may “boomerang disastrously.” The President stated these in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. The President appealed to Governors “to review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles, warning that the policy might boomerang disastrously.” He also advised state and local governments to be more proactive by improving security around schools and their surroundings. He described the abduction of 317 girls in Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe in Zamfara as inhumane and totally unacceptable. He warned bandits that they cannot defeat government, stating: “No criminal group can be too strong to be defeated by the government. The only thing standing between our security forces and the bandits are the rules of engagement. “Let them not entertain any illusions that they are more powerful than the government. They shouldn’t mistake our restraint for the humanitarian goals of protecting innocent lives as a weakness or a sign of fear or irresolution.”
