A mentally-ill girl has been released from a room where she reportedly chained by her mother in the Arochukwu area of Abia State. The teenager simply called Ada was said to have been locked in a room with a chain round her neck and limbs. She was rescued on Sunday by operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in collaboration with Vicar Hope Foundation and the Child Protection Network; a non-government organisation run by Mrs Nkechi Ikpeazu, wife of the state governor Okezie Ikpeazu. The rescue took place at the weekend in Umuokoro Obinkita Arochukwu Local Government Area of the state.. Ada’s plight became public knowledge after it was published on WhatsApp, though with little detail. After learning of the girl’s plight on social media Mrs Ikpeazu reportedly directed that it be investigated. Following its confirmation, officials of NSCDC moved in, forced open the door where the girl was held and unchained her. Her mother, who gave her name as Blessing, has been taken into custody, but she said her mentally-ill daughter was chained to keep her from wandering off. Spokesman of the NSCDC Ndukwe Aguiyi confirmed Blessing’s arrest as well as the rescue of her daughter.
