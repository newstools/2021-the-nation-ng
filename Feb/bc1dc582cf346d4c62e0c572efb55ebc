The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday faulted the confirmation of former Service Chiefs as ambassadors-designate. It accused the Senate of hurriedly screening them despite pending petitions against them in a bid to grant them immunity. In a statement by its spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said: “It is indeed horrendous that the All Progressives Congress (APC) leadership in the Senate could choose to betray Nigerians by rushing to clear the accused ex-Service Chiefs in a desperate attempt to grant them diplomatic immunity and shield them from investigation and prosecution for the atrocities committed against Nigerians under their command. “Though it is public knowledge that the current APC Senate leadership is a mere rubber stamp and contrivance being used to endorse atrocious policies and suppress the will of the people, but descending to the level of aiding and abetting a crime against humanity by attempting to confer diplomatic immunity on the accused ex-commanders is, to say the least, despicable. “It is indeed shameful that the APC leadership in the Senate could clear the ex-service chiefs, who the National Assembly had earlier indicted and requested for their sack over security failures and alleged compromises. Such reward for failure amounts to stabbing our nation in the back”
