There was disquiet within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State on Sunday with angry reactions to a video in which a man claimed that some villages in Ayete area of Ibarapa have been sacked by herders. The video, which surfaced on social media, accused the Police and Governor Seyi Makinde of keeping quiet while some of the villagers were being killed by herders and a remnant fled for their lives. The video claimed the traditional ruler of Ayete community had cried out to the government many times to no avail. The man in the video said Makinde would make state broadcast and issue press statements the moment the villagers make move to defend themselves and their lands, which may result in killing of some Fulani in the process. The issue was made popular when the video was uploaded on the PDP WhatsApp group set up by the Publicity Secretary Akeem Olatunji with members of the group commenting. Makinde is said to be in the WhatsApp group. Reading some of the comments, the Governor reportedly reacted angrily, wondering why every claim by anybody should attract the government’s reaction and attention. He said Olatunji needed mature people who could make meaningful contributions on the platform. In anger, he exited the group. But his decision has stirred controversy among members, leaders and other residents of the state such that it has become the subject of discussion on other popular Whatsapp groups in the state. In other WhatsApp groups, PDP and members of other political parties, as well as non-politicians, have been discussing the propriety of Makinde’s action. While many fault him, positing that he could not manage his temperament and could not accommodate opposing views, some said he was right to do so because social media platforms are full of fake news, illogical arguments and unsubstantiated claims. The discussions are still on.
