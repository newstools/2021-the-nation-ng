Hundreds of Nigerian social media users last Wednesday un-followed Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd), after he advised citizens to defend themselves against bandits and kidnappers instead of “running from minor things like that.” He said: “It is the responsibility of everybody to keep alert and to find safety when necessary. But we shouldn’t be cowards. “At times, the bandits will only come with three rounds of ammunition, when they fire shots everybody runs. In our younger days, we stand to fight any aggression coming for us. They should stand and let these people know that even the villagers have the competency and capabilities to defend themselves.” Many Nigerians were offended and accused him of shirking his responsibility as nation’s Defence Minister. When asked about licensing firearms for citizens to defend themselves, he said: “Even in developed countries, they are debating whether to continue or not. I don’t advise Nigeria to start issuing firearms for personal use.” The illogic of his position further angered many. The retired general, who had less than three hundred followers on tweeter at the time he made the statement, lost more than a hundred of them within twenty four hours. One of his erstwhile followers even took to her social media handle to ask if the minister “expected Nigerians to fight the armed bandits with sticks and knives.”
