He will be missed by thousands of people whom he had assisted in one way or the other. “His role in politics and the development of his community, local government and indeed, the state, will remain an inspiration for other youths in politics. “On behalf of the government and people of Delta, I mourn the death of Mr Okiemute Sowho, who was my aide until his untimely demise. “I commiserate with his family and urge security agencies to investigate the unfortunate incident and bring the perpetrators to justice. “Let me urge all Deltans to remain peaceful and maintain the existing peace, and report all suspicious movements and acts to security agencies,” Okowa said.
