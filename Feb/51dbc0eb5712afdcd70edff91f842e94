A mob on Thursday set a hotel ablaze in Owerri, the Imo State capital, after a commercial sex worker allegedly stabbed her client to death. The incident happened at Skelewu Hotel in the Umuguma area of the capital city. The sex worker was said to have stabbed her client to death during an argument after the man failed to pay for service rendered. The incident caused panic in the area, grounding commercial activities as traders hurriedly closed their shops. Policemen cordoned off the hotel as firefighters tried to put out the fire. A source said, “A commercial sex worker killed his male friend because he was unable to pay her after a sex marathon. This is what happened this afternoon.” But angered by the man’s death, residents mobilised and set the hotel, a haven for sex workers, ablaze. Military men were at the scene. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu did not get back to  the reporter at press time.
