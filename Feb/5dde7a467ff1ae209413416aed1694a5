The Lagos State government has raised alarm over the unbridled and fraudulent sale of government land by Land Grabbers otherwise known as Omoniles in the State. Permanent Secretary, Land Bureau, Bode Agoro at a stakeholders’ forum on fraudulent sales of Lagos State Government land by Land Grabbers ( Omonile) Wednesday, lamented the activities of dubious elements in certain communities who are selling government land to unsuspecting members of the public in some parts of Lagos especially in Ibeju- Lekki, Eti-Osa and even Kosofe Local Government areas. He said: “These Land Grabbers have now taken their game to a new level as they have the audacity to erect signpost bearing Lagos State Government logo and excision application file numbers in their desperate attempt to deceive prospective buyers into believing that sales of such lands are genuine transactions and have government backing.” “This engagement is, therefore, crucial at this material time as we cannot afford to fold our arms while some dubious persons continue to take advantage of hardworking and responsible Lagosians by selling illegal lands to them.” According to him, if the Omonile syndrome was not nipped in the bud, it would fester and continue to prevent many well-meaning corporate organisations from making investment decisions due to the confusion, anarchy and avoidable conflicts caused by land grabbers’ activities.
