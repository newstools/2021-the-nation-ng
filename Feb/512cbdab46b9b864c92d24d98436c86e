Delta police have arrested a mortuary attendant in Oghara, Ethiope West council area following the disappearance of the body of a 58-year-old woman, Mrs Patience Amughoro, from a private hospital morgue. The Nation gathered that the deceased died last year after a brief illness. It was learnt the family had planned to bury her on February 20, but we’re stunned when on Saturday they arrived at the morgue to find that the body was missing. A family source Okiemute said the morgue attendant had earlier presented a body but on close examination it was found that it was not Amughoro’s. He said, “That was when he began searching, pacing up and down looking for the body before admitting the body was missing.” Continuing, “We were shocked. There was no explanation. We had made arrangements to give our aunt a good send-off, and it hurts that we don’t have her body. Another source said, “We were surprised that a whole dead body should go missing from a mortuary. I have never heard of a corpse developing legs and leaving the morgue.” Delta Police image maker, Edafe Bright , confirmed the incident, adding that investigation was ongoing.
