The Iyaloja-General, Chief Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, has ordered all markets in Lagos closed to honour the late Alhaji Lateef Jakande. Chief Tinubu-Ojo told The Nation that the first civilian governor of Lagos state deserved more than that for his giant strides. She said it was a mark of respect and solidarity in honour of the deceased. “We are shutting down all markets tomorrow (today) to mourn our father. We all know he was the former governor of Lagos, who dedicated his time to develop the state, and dedicating a day in his honour is a good thing,” she said. Confirming the directive, Chief Executive Officer of Bolswot Ventures at Oshodi Market, Alhaja Bola Olufowobi, said the Iyaloja-General’s initiative was a welcome idea. The late Jakande, she said, deserved the honour. “He was a good man. We are happy with the directive,” she said. Most street traders around the Idimu axis were not aware, but Madam Beatrice, at Ikotun market, said an announcer went round the market to announce the closure.
