The Odua Peoples Congress (OPC) on Wednesday discontinued the search and rescue mission for the four kidnapped transport workers on Ilesha-Akure Expressway. The Nation reports that seven transport union workers were abducted by suspected herdsmen at Iwaraja junction on Ilesha/Akure Expressway in Ori-Ade Local Government of Osun State on Monday evening. However, it was said that they released three of them later. OPC Coordinator Prince Deji Aladeshawe said on Wednesday that his men had pulled out of the rescue operation. He did not state the reasons for their action, but said since they embarked on the rescue mission, no security agency had visited them on the scene, except the Commander of Osun ‘Amotekun Corps’, Gen. Bashir Adewinmbi (rtd). When Adewinmbi was contacted, he said: “The OPC should bear with us. The state government is working round the clock to take very good care of them. The governor is concerned about the welfare of everyone involved in the security sector in the state. They should not despair, they will be compensated. We have a very good plan for them.”
