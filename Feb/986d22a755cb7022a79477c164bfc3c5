Original equipment manufacturer (OEM),Tecno, yesterday in Lagos, gave N2million and other items to its fans in commemoration of Valentine’s Day. The smartphone brand had called for couples in romantic relationships to tell their love stories. Many heeded the call as numerous couples shared beautiful stories that made people smile. They recorded interactive videos with their partners describing how old their love journey was, their experiences, and the things they admired in each other. Some of the couples posted pictures instead, writing the details of their love journey as captions. The videos/pictures were posted on the brand’s social media pages using the hashtag # Tecno BlueValentine. Genuine stories were picked daily across the brand’s social media platforms. The couples with those stories won the New Tecno Buds 1 Bluetooth wireless earpiece while two lucky couples won a grand prize of N2million Couple-Anniversary reward. And all they did was visit any of the brand’s recommended retail stores nationwide to buy any Camon 16 series smartphone or the Spark 5 Pro. Ex BBN Housemates Ozo and Mercy were at one of Tecno’s stores, spending quality time with Tecno fans and raising the excitement to the roof. Osho Ganiyat Kofo and Gift Ajirioghene Efeteha emerged the lucky winners, winning gifts and cash of N1million each.
