 In-form Lorient striker Terem Moffi has been recognized for his outstanding performance this past weekend after he was named in the French Ligue 1 Team of the Week by French national daily newspaper devoted to sport, L’Équipe. The 21-year-old scored twice to earn a point for FC Lorient against Monaco in their league encounter on Sunday, taking his goal tally for the season to nine in all competitions, with eight of them coming in the league. Moffi was also Lorient’s hero the previous weekend having scored the winning goal as Les Merlus shocked Paris Saint-Germain 3-2 and in the Coupe de France clash with Paris FC last Wednesday, Moffi needed just 3 minutes to announce his presence, coming on in the 80th minute and scoring the winner in the 83rd minute. Christophe Pélissier, Moffi’s manager at Lorient believes he is showing his true potential adding that the former Kortkijk of Belgium forward gives the team more options in the front with his quality. “I had followed him a lot, in Belgium but also in Lithuania. And I have been saying it from the start: he will bring us a lot in relation to his power, his qualities as a scorer,” recalled coach Christophe Pelissier. “He is showing us his true level. He had difficulty adapting.”. Thanks to this result, Lorient occupy 17th position with 23 points from 24 games, while Monaco sit in the fourth spot with 49 points from 24 outings.
