 LAGOS State Professional Footballers Association of Nigeria (PFAN) has instituted an annual U20 football tournament after late ex-Super Eagles defender Yisa Sofoluwe. According to chairman of Lagos State PFAN, Taju Disu the Yisa Sofoluwe Memorial U20 Football Championship will kick off next month in remembrance of the contribution of the late football legend to Nigerian football. The championship will be bankrolled by the incumbent chairman of Surulere Local Government Area (LGA) Hon. Tajudeen Ajide. “This tournament is made possible by the sports loving chairman of Surulere LG, Ajide who has profound respect for the former Super Eagles star. The objective of this tournament is to ensure that a football hero like Sofoluwe is not forgotten in death. “Sofoluwe inspired many and so we do not want his death to go like that. We don’t want it to be like what we experience everyday whereas once a football star dies, he is forgotten by the system,” Disu added. Proceeds of the championship will be handed to the family of the deceased. Disu revealed that Sofoluwe played a key role in the formation of PFAN and would have been part of the new executive council of Lagos PFAN if death had not claimed him. Meanwhile, the list of administrative board members of PFAN Lagos branch has been released.
