 Governor Nyesom Wike has approved the purchase of new buses for two Rivers State Government-owned Football Clubs, Rivers United and Rivers Angels. Rivers United is to get a 54-seater air-conditioned luxury bus fitted with convenience and other accessories, while Rivers Angels will get a 25-seater air-conditioned coaster bus. The move designed for the comfort of players and officials, will boost the teams’ morale, especially Rivers United that is involved in a CAF club competition and doing well in the domestic league. Rivers Commissioner for Sports, Boma Iyaye, who broke the news shortly before Rivers United encounter against Adamawa United in the on-going NPFL commended Governor Wike for his genuine interest towards the development of sports Accompanied by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Sir Honour Sirawoo, Iyaye said the governor was passionate about the progress of Rivers United, Rivers Angels, and Rivers Hoopers, and is ready to do all within his powers to make the clubs even better. The Commissioner said the gesture, coming few months after the governor reconstructed the dilapidated main football and training pitches of the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, will no doubt, serve as a further tonic in the teams’ performance. “Recall that it was Governor Wike that gave new buses some years ago, and cleared outstanding salaries, bonuses, and allowances of the clubs. He has just approved another set of brand new and sophisticated buses for them. “We must commend him for this magnanimity and show of support. His timely interventions have been our propelling force and I am glad the teams are living up to expectations,” Iyaye stated. He charged the Clubs to reciprocate the kind gesture by giving their best and fighting for all available titles within and outside Nigeria.
