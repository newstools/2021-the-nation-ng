 One of the BBNaija Lockdown alumni, Kiddwaya, has revealed the biggest lesson he learned recently. Kiddwaya made this known during a question and answer session with his fans via his Instagram story. The Benue State indigene said he learned that the closest people are the most dangerous. “It’s the closest people to you that are the most dangerous,” he shared. Revealing his goals for 2021, he said, “Get into top physical shape, secure some big deals, be on the big screen and take our brand international.” On why celebs hide their relationship status, Kiddwaya said “Because they’re a lot of toxic people out there that want to destroy whatever beautiful thing you have, so you need to protect that.” How he feels when people belittle his achievements by pinning it on his family’s wealth, he said, “I just keep on pressing their necks with my success. Their opinion takes no food off my plate.”
