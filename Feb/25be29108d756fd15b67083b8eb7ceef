The Osun State Panel of Inquiry investigating Police brutality and extra-judicial killing on Friday summoned two officers of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps(NSCDC) for alleged involvement in a hot car chase that led to the death of one Idris Ajibola. Idris was allegedly chased to death by men of the Osun State Joint Task Force after he went to Osun Mall with two friends in a car on September 15, 2020. According to Adedayo Adeleke, one of the occupants of the car told the panel that the patrol vehicle of JTF chased them to the point they had an accident that resulted in the death of Idris.
The Nations reports that the distraught mother of the deceased, Mrs. Titilayo Ajibola, demanded N5 billion as compensation while giving evidence before the panel. At the last adjourned date, the case was closed by parties involved, however, the petitionerâ€™s counsel, Mr. Kanmi Ajibola, in one of the documents submitted to the panel, alleged that two officers of NSCDC, named; Jimi Awoniyi and Togun Babatunde were involved in the chase of Idris and friends. At the sitting of the panel on Friday, the Chairman, Justice Akin Oladimeji, ordered that the two officers should be served a summon notice and must be at the sitting on March 5, 2021for further defence.
