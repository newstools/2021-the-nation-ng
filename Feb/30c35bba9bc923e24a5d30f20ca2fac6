Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta was “frustrated and disappointed” after watching his team drop three more points against Aston Villa on Saturday. Goalkeeper Mat Ryan conceded 74 seconds into his debut for Arsenal as Aston Villa completed their first top-flight double over the Gunners for 28 years. Former Arsenal keeper Emiliano Martinez started the move which led to Bertrand Traore pouncing on a mistake by Cedric Soares before Ollie Watkins scored with a shot that deflected off Rob Holding. He said: “Yes, frustration and disappointment. To lose the game the way we did is incredible. But, saying that, if you give something to the opponent – and it’s not once. “Yes but still, the reaction of the team was there and we kept playing and we kept creating chances and playing forward and dominating the game completely. You have to put an end to it and in training there are certain things you can do but against pace and against an opposition it’s something different and we have to do that, that’s what we have to improve.” John McGinn and Jack Grealish were both denied by Ryan while Watkins forced the new Arsenal keeper into two further saves. Burkina Faso forward Traore brought fresh energy after being a substitute on Wednesday, while Ezri Konsa and Tyrone Mings helped limit Arsenal to three attempts on target.
