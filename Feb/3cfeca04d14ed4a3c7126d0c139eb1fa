Dele Alli scored a superb overhead kick as Tottenham cruised into the Europa League last 16 with an 8-1 aggregate win over Austrian side Wolfsberger. Spurs were already in control of the tie following a 4-1 first-leg victory and quickly asserted their authority at home with Alli’s spectacular effort. It was in keeping with an impressive performance by Alli, who was at his creative best to also lay on two goals. Carlos Vinicius scored twice, either side of a Gareth Bale effort. No team in Uefa Cup or Europa League history has overturned a three-goal deficit from the first leg at home to progress and Wolfsberger never threatened to do so here. Spurs could have had more, with Vinicius coolly rounding goalkeeper Manuel Kuttin before Gustav Henriksson cleared off the line. But Vinicius did get his goal with a back-post header from Alli’s smart cross, before substitute Bale lashed into the top corner from the Englishman’s through ball. Striker Vinicius added his second and Tottenham’s fourth to complete the rout after good work from 16-year-old Dane Scarlett. Jose Mourinho’s side will find out who they face in the next round during Friday’s draw.
