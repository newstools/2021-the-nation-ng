The Senate on Wednesday observed a minute’s silence in honour of a former Minister of Information, late Tony Momoh. The action of the Senate followed a motion sponsored by Senator Francis Ailimikhena where he drew the attention of his colleagues to the incident. Citing Order 43 of the Senate Standing Rules, Ailimikhena who represents Edo North, eulogised the late Momoh and called on the Senate to honour him. He prayed the Senate to observe a minute’s silence in his honour, send a delegation to commiserate with the family of the deceased as well as call on the Federal Government to immortalise him by naming a national monument in his honour. Senate President Ahmad Lawan in his remarks said since Senator Ailimikhena’s point of order was predicated on Order 43 which does not allow for a debate after a personal explanation, the Senate will only carry out the one minute silence and no more.
