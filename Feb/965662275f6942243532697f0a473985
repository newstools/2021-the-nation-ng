A road accident has claimed the Adamawa State correspondent of Voice of America (VOA) and Premium Times, Ibrahim Abdulazeez. Ibrahim who was also a broadcaster with Yola based radio/television house, Gotel Communications, died Friday in a road accident on the Bauchi-Alkaleri highway during a trip for a wedding. Ibrahim who also ran Adamawa Times, an online news medium, would be remembered as a mixer who got along well with virtually everyone. Ibrahim who was the immediate past assistant secretary of Correspondents’ Chapel in Adamawa State, was last seen by his fellow correspondents at the Correspondents Chapel Gallery in the Deputy Governor’s Office complex, Yola, in the afternoon of Thursday, February 4 when Governor Nyesom Wike visited the state. As his colleagues were leaving for the Yola International Airport to be part of the convoy to receive visiting Nyesom Wike, Ibrahim had instead opted for the Gotel Communications broadcasting complex in Girei where he said he needed to present a programme. The Adamawa State chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) said in a statement Friday evening that Ibrahim’s sudden death was disheartening. “The Adamawa State council of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) regrets to announce the death of one of its members, Ibrahim Abdullazeez,” Secretary of the NUJ, Fidelis Jockthan said in the statement. The NUJ scribe consoled members and urged them to await further development regarding Ibrahim’s burial arrangememts.
