 APM Terminals Apapa has boosted its operation with  additional four Rubber Tyred Ganrty (RTG) cranes. This is part of a larger equipment fleet renewal and expansion, where a total of seven RTGs, seven Reach Stackers and two Empty Handlers have been acquired. With the new acquisition, APM Terminals Apapa is targetting 30 RTGs. It has 13 Mobile Harbour Cranes (MHCs), in addition to several reach stackers, forklifts, empty handlers and specialised terminal trucks; making it the best equipped port terminal in Nigeria. The Chief Operating Officer of APM Terminals Apapa, Steen Knudsen, explained that the new cranes, which were built with the latest technology, have lifting capacity of 41 tons and will ensure efficient services to the entire port community. He said the new cranes were acquired as part of an ongoing investment of $80 million for 2020-2021, bringing the total investment by the company in its Apapa port terminal since 2006 to $438 million (N168 billion). “We remain committed to deepening our investment in Apapa to enable us handle increasing volumes at the port. The additional investments will create capacity to handle growth in the economy to support the Federal Government’s efforts on trade growth and improve service delivery across the logistic chain,” Knudsen said. He said APM Terminals Apapa recently deployed 4G LTE wireless network and inaugurated its Operation Command Centre to enhance service delivery. “We have embarked on massive digitisation of our operations and services. This is in keeping with our global transformation drive,’’ he added.
