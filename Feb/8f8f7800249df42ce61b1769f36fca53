The 2019 AFCON top scorer Odion Ighalo has dedicated his first goal for Saudi Arabian club Al Shabab to his son Daniel who marked his birthday anniversary on February 12. Ighalo joined the Saudi Professional League side on a two-and-a-half-year contract early this month and has featured just in two games with his first goal in the 4-1 rout of Al Nasar on Saturday. “That(goal)  was for you son Daniel Ighalo,” the former Manchester United loanee  posted  thereafter. The widely-travelled Ighalo  has now scored  a goal across six different leagues including  Norway, Spain, Italy, China, England and now Saudi Arabia. Yet Ighalo has promised that he hopes his first goal for Saudi Arabian club Al Shabab will be the first of many for him. Al Shabab went four points clear at the top of the table Saturday night when Ighalo came off the bench to score the fourth goal in stoppage time in the drubbing of the home team Al Nassr and former club of Ahmed Musa. “1st of many,” Ighalo tweeted after he opened his goals account in only his second game for his new club. Shabab top the standings with 38 points from 21 matches. Al Nassr, champions two years ago with Ahmed Musa, slipped to seventh on the table with 25 points.
