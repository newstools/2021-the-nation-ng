Founder of Christ Life Church Ibadan, Bishop Wale Oke, has narrated how a UNILAG lecturer demanding sex from one his spiritual daughter was killed by God. He said the lecturer, a Head of Department (HoD), had been failing the lady for two years because she refused to sleep with him. Speaking in a sermon monitored by The Nation, he said: “One of my daughters was being harrassed. It was the University of Lagos. The lecturer was on her. ‘’He said he would manage to sleep with her before she would pass the course. A man old enough to be her father. “Very wicked evil man. And the girl said, ‘I’m a child of God. I’m born again’. And he said, ‘You, you know how many of you I’ve dealt with? You won’t leave my department’. I will make sure you fail that course. “And the course is compulsory such that if you don’t pass, you can’t move on. He failed her the first time. She tried to fast and pray. Nothing changed. She failed her second time. By the rule, she would have to withdraw. “She came to see me. How can one filthy old man want to sleep with my daughter because he’s a lecturer. I’ll forget I’m anointed and cut off your head. She started crying. I stood on my feet and said, ‘O God, judge this matter.’” Oke alleged that a few weeks later, the lecturer was traveling in the company of another lady when he had an accident and died. “Tears in my eyes. Don’t let a prophet pray against you. It’s very dangerous. Two years of her life had been wasted and the man still insisted. Two weeks after, the lecturer and a girl he was sleeping with had an accident,” he added. “They died along Lagos-Ibadan express. My God killed him. True story. When they were going to appoint another head of department to replace this evil man, they appointed a Reemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) pastor.”
