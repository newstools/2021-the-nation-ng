Wilfred Ndidi was named as the most influential player worthy of the Man of the Match as Leicester City came back from a goal down to beat champions Liverpool 3-1 today. The defensive midfielder, who earlier this week made his comeback game after a hamstring injury last month, was outstanding as ‘The Foxes’ climbed to second spot in the Premier League. Speaking on LCFC Radio at full-time, Matt Elliott said: “Harvey Barnes was instrumental in Leicester turning things round. Leicester’s main dangerman was Harvey Barnes. He was hugely influential and slotted in late on. The defenders had given up on him! All match, I thought Wilfred Ndidi was monumental in midfield, but for me, in terms of being a game changer, I’ve got to pick Harvey Barnes.” Ndidi made more recoveries (11) and won more aerial duels (5) in the first half of the game. He also provided the well-crafted assist for Leicester City third goal in the 85th minute. In a game in which Leicester City were on the back foot for most of the time, Ndidi’s pressing in the middle kept them in it. The Nigerian cleaned up everything that came near him, using his fine anticipation of the game to intercept passes, making clean tackles and taking balls off Liverpool players.
