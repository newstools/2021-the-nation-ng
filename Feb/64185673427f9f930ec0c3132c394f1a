  Efe Ajagba said former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder’s new-found love for Africa is fake and it is only happening to gain sympathy from Africans since losing to Tyson Fury last year. Wilder lost his World Boxing Council (WBC) and the vacant The Ring, and lineal heavyweight titles by a seventh-round technical knockout to Fury at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Paradise, Nevada. Ajagba shared the same manager, Shelley Finkel, with The Bronze Bomber before joining Top Rank, who manages current WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, last year. “I don’t know why Wilder would post that video saying he is an African Giant, How is it possible,” Ajagba said in an online interview with Boxing Block Centre. “Wilder just remembered Africa after he lost to Fury.” “Just because he lost doesn’t mean he should change who he is.” “If he had beaten Fury he would not have remembered Africa, let us be honest to ourselves.” Ajagba later posted a reply for the former WBC world champion donning an African-themed attire on Instagram where a fan was urging him to face Wilder in the future.
