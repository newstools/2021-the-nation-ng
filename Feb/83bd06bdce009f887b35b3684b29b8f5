Yet Lippi, a former coach of the Italian national team world champion in 2006, told Radio Rai that Osimhen is an added value to Napoli, while blaming the injury the Nigerian had on his inability to impact the team. “Gattuso had to do without many players, now Mertens is not there, Osimhen has not been available for a long time. Now Koulibaly is also missing. It has not been an easy season for the Italian coach, “remarked Lippi who also had stint as China’s national team coach. “The Nigerian is able to give depth to his team. But he has never played due to a shoulder injury or COVID. The pandemic has made things very complicated “. Meanwhile, Osimhen and his teammates have thrown their weight behind under-fire Gattuso after their all-important 1-0 win over Juventus. The locker room is on the side of the Napoli coach and further confirmation came through the social media with the players who in many posts have written ‘United we are stronger’ confirming the fact that.
