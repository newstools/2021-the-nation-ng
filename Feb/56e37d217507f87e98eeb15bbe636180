A Lagos mobile court has sentenced a fake soldier to six weeks imprisonment for assault and impersonation. Chairman of the state Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit Shola Jejeloye said Kabiru Mohammed was arrested on Friday by operatives of the task force after he assaulted their members at Airport bus stop on Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway. The fake soldier’s commercial motorcycle was painted in military camouflage colours, Jejelola said. He said the operatives of the agency were coming from a monitoring and enforcement operation with over 150 impounded motorcycles loaded in three trucks when the fake soldier, whose commercial motorcycle was among those impounded, mobilised other miscreants and attacked the team with stones, bottles and iron rods. ”The fake soldier was subsequently arrested after the attack and during investigations at our office it was discovered that he was an impersonator. “The man later confessed to having only claimed to be a soldier in order to retrieve his impounded commercial motorcycle and that he painted his motorcycle with Nigerian Army camouflage to evade arrest from security agents while engaging in commercial activities on restricted routes,” Jejeloye said. Magistrate Oyebimbola Israel Adelakun, who presided over the matter same day, sentenced Mohammed, 25, to six weeks in jail with N40,000 as an option of fine.
