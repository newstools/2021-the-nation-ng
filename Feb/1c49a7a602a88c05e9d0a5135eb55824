 To deliver community-focused initiatives, FBNQuest, the investment banking and asset management subsidiary of FBN Holdings Plc, has continued to partner Teach for Nigeria (TFN) by supporting the latter’s Incubation Hub Pitch Contest and Annual Mentoring Programme. The contest is a three-month programme that provides TFN alumni an opportunity to accelerate growth through their social impact projects. The Incubation Hub is designed to equip participants with the practical knowledge required to build and sustain their enterprise. This is delivered through training workshops, access to post-programme support, mentoring and an opportunity to pitch for seed funding for their enterprise. The Bookaclan Literacy and No Box Initiatives emerged winners of the contest and were given funds to scale their projects. Chief Executive Officer, Teach for Nigeria Folawe Omikunle, stated: “We are on a mission to address educational inequality in Nigeria. We believe that equipping our alumni with the skills and knowledge to start and scale their initiatives will bring us closer to our vision of educating all children in Nigeria.” Employees of FBNQuest also volunteered to mentor TFN Fellows in professional development as they transition from the Fellowship programme, as well as support them to implement their social impact project themed Be the Change Projects in their placement schools. Head, People & Knowledge Engagement,  FBNQuest Lolade Sasore, stated: “We recognise the role education plays as a catalyst for growth and development, and we remain committed to equipping our youth with the right skills to excel. “Through this and other partnerships, we hope to provide access to more opportunities for young leaders to actively contribute to building a stable economy.”
