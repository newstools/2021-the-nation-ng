Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho still believes his side can finish in the top four of the Premier League and says the current table does not mean anything. A poor run of just three wins in the last 12 games has seen Spurs slip from the top of the table down to ninth and they are now outsiders to secure Champions League qualification. Sunday’s visit to West Ham seems pivotal as they are six points behind the Hammers, with a game in hand and a victory will reignite their top-four hopes. In a see-saw season, where teams have all played different amounts of games, Mourinho says anything is still possible. “In the same way you lose three matches and you go to a bad position, you win three matches and go to a much better position,” the Portuguese said. “So like happened last season, let’s go until the end and see what the table gives us. In the end, the table always gives you what you deserve.
