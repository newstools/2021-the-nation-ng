 A former National Publicity Secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association ( NBA),  Mr. John Austin  Unachukwu, last week in Lagos,  described the former Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande as a selfless leader who should be emulated by all. Mr. Unachukwu stated this when he led a delegation of the 1992/ 94 set of the Nigerian Institute of Journalism ( NIJ)  on a condolence visit to  commiserate with the family over the demise of the former Lagos helmsman. Unachukwu described the late Jakande  as a servant leader, who lived a modest life among his people and gave his all for their wellbeing. According to him, promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest majority was his philosophy  and driving force. “I am a great beneficiary of his good leadership and infrastructural development in Lagos State. Apart from attending the NIJ in which he was a critical stakeholder, I also attended the Lagos State University where I enjoyed scholarship to obtain  my Law  degrees. The university   was built under his regime and today, we are proud of being greatest Lasuites. ‘’I urge everybody to uphold and sustain the values and principles for which he lived, this is the only way to immortalise this great statesman. The family should take solace in the fact that Baba is alive in the minds of people too numerous to mention” Unachukwu stated. Receiving the delegation on behalf of the family, the deceased’s son Hon Deji Jakande, who is a member of the class, expressed gratitude that the class could come together to visit  and condole with him. He urged the group to extend his greetings to other members of the class.
