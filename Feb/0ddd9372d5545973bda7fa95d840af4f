Leicester’s increasingly forlorn-looking pursuit of Premier League leaders Manchester City suffered a big blow as Arsenal came from behind to claim an impressive victory at the King Power Stadium. Having gone out of the Europa League on Thursday, the Foxes were given an early tonic by the Gunners as Youri Tielemens was allowed to run unchecked down the right before firing a low shot into the far corner with just six minutes played. Arsenal refused to be adversely affected, though, and took control of the game with impressive attacking intent and far greater fluency than the hosts. David Luiz brought them level, finding space in the box to steer a header in from Willian’s free-kick. Alexandre Lacazette then put them ahead after the video assistant referee (VAR) judged that Wilfred Ndidi had blocked Nicolas Pepe’s shot in the box with an outstretched arm. It was second time lucky for the Gunners, who had earlier had a penalty awarded on the pitch but then downgraded to a free-kick after VAR decided the offending tackle on Pepe had taken place just outside the area. Ivory Coast forward Pepe got in on the act himself, tapping into a largely unguarded net after Willian’s pass had deflected his way. However, it came at a potential cost, though, with Emile Smith Rowe – such a bright spark in recent months – having to leave the field injured in the first half. Leicester suffered a big injury blow of their own, influential winger Harvey Barnes having to be carried off on a stretcher with his leg in a brace after pulling up during a sprint. The Foxes’ sixth home loss of the campaign leaves them 10 points behind a Manchester City side who have won their past 20 games. Arsenal move up to ninth, eight points off the top four but with a renewed interest in events above them in the table. BBCSport
