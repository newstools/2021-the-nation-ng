The Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Senator John James Akpanudoedehe on Wednesday night said the party holds its former interim National Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande in high esteem. He also said similar honour is extended to National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. When contacted to react to Akande’s assessment of the on-going nationwide party membership registration, update and revalidation exercise, the APC scribe said: “Ah ah, anything that concerns Baba Akande is no go area. For me, I owe Baba Akande and Tinubu a lot of gratitude, honour and respect. “Mr. President, the Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni and the party hold them in high esteem too. Whatever he (Akande) said, we allow it to pass.”
