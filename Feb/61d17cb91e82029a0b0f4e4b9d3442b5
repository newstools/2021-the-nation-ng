Suspected hoodlums have invaded the Osun State University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, to retrieve the corpse of a patient who died of COVID-19. The invasion which happened on Thursday caused pandemonium in the hospital as some of the invaders allegedly unplugged the life-support machines in the Accident and Emergency Unit of the hospital. The Nation gathered that the patient died of COVID-19 in the hospital and the family members insisted that the management release the corpse to them for burial. However, nurses and other health personnel denied their request, explaining to them that burial will be conducted by officials of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC). It was gathered that the position of the management angered the family members and they lead hoodlums to the hospital to retrieve the corpse. They are said to have disrupted hospital activities and unplugged the life-support machines of some patients in protest. Reacting to the invasion on Saturday, the Chief Medical Director of UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital, Prof Peter Olaitan, said, “two patients died of COVID-19 and the relations felt the diagnosis was not correct and started making trouble that they would like to bury their dead relations. Normally COVID corpses are buried by the COVID team to avoid infection of other members of the public. We later resolved the matter. No patient had the life support removed or died as a result of this.”
