I am not aware of the cause of his death. I just got a call that his neighbours did not see him for days so they got concerned. “They went to his house, knocked on his door but got no response so they had to break down the door. That was when they saw him sitting on his chair lifeless. “He was already smelling as he was decomposing. I rushed down there to arrange the necessary things.” She added that several hospitals rejected the body of the late actor because it was already decomposing. “I had to obtain a police report and cars to convey him to a hospital. I took him to several hospitals but they rejected him because his body was already decomposing. At about 3 am this morning, we were referred to a private hospital in Bwari, Abuja, where they accepted his body. This morning, they are embalming his body but they need to first reduce its size as he has swollen.” Decker starred in films like Double Strings, If I am President and Lotanna.
