An entrepreneur and anchor of Journeys in African Entrepreneurship, Patrenia Onuoha has said her organisation have set in motion a process that would help entrepreneurs in Africa to attain their potentials. Onuoha said one of the plans is the creation of Mojo360 heroes’ summit. It is a summit that will run on a regular basis whereby entrepreneurs can share ideas and inspire people on their trade. An edition of the programme, which will hold from Friday 26 to Sunday 28, will feature free zoom seminars with Osaretin Guobadia, Chukuka Chukuma co-authors of InPursuit and Ebele Agu among several others. At the meeting participants will tell their stories and how to attain greatness while also giving tips on how upcoming entrepreneurs can achieve success in their chosen fields. Onuoha said she is being motivated by the need for entrepreneurs in Africa to identify their strengths and build on them. During a recent virtual meeting, Onuoha noted that the only way an entrepreneur could succeed was to be known for something specific rather than many things. She further stated that entrepreneurs needed to be on top of their game and stay focused on their goals. The Vice President of the Working to Advance African Women Foundation, Ebelechukwu Agu, in her contribution, emphasised the importance of entrepreneurs selling themselves to the world. She urged African entrepreneurs to exit their comfort zone and tell their stories to the world for impact. “You need to tell your story, you need to step out of your comfort zone and network,” she said, adding that, “An entrepreneur has to be a perpetual learner. The entrepreneur must also be a relationship builder and a problem solver. That is the way to excel.”
