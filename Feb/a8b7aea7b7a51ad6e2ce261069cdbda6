Students of Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri, Imo State, have vowed to block the state government house in protest if the family of slain student of the institution, Anthony Chinweotito, did not get justice. The 20 year-old Anthony was last week beaten to death by his caretaker over payment of house rent. The Students Union Government of the polytechnic, who demanded justice for the first year student of the institution, decried the intimidation of students by hostel owners in the community. The SUG president of the polytechnic, Chuwuebuka Eze, who spoke to journalists on Tuesday in Owerri, said, “we want nothing but justice for the student. “As students, we will not accept anything but justice for the National Diploma one student who was killed. We embarked on a march on Monday and we have told the authorities what we want.” The student leader said that the students would block the state government house to demand justice for the slain student if justice was not served, quickly. Eze continued, “We have given a time frame and if the timeline expires and nothing is done, we will block Imo state government until the governor sees and addresses us. “We want the killer caretaker prosecuted. We want the family of the deceased student to be compensated. We want the immediate stop of the intimidation of the students by hostel owners in our school’s host community, Nekede. We will stop at nothing in ensuring that Anthony gets justice.” Eze also said that the students were demanding that the hostel where the undergraduate was killed was shut and occupants of the hostel who had paid for rent be refunded. The SUG president said, “we are also demanding that Ezinwanne hostel where our fellow student was killed be shut down, immediately. Apart from the shutting down of the hostel, we demand that students who have already renewed their rents be refunded so that they will relocate, immediately.”
