US golf legend Tiger Woods was recovering in hospital after surgery for serious leg injuries sustained in a car crash that have raised fears for the 45-year-old’s career. Law enforcement officials said the 15-time major champion, who has been plagued by injury in recent years, was lucky to survive the accident in which his car rolled several times. Woods was driving alone in a Los Angeles suburb on a road notorious for fatal accidents when his SUV crashed on Tuesday morning, with fire-fighters and paramedics having to cut him out of the wreckage. His representatives said in a statement on Woods’s Twitter account that the golfer, one of the greatest of all time, was “currently awake, responsive, and recovering in his hospital room.” In the same statement, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center chief medical officer Anish Mahajan said Woods underwent surgery to repair “significant orthopaedic injuries” to his lower right leg and ankle. This included the insertion of a rod into his shin bone and the use of “a combination of screws and pins” to stabilize his foot and ankle, the statement read. Woods recently underwent his fifth back operation and has had three procedures on his knee during a career that has also seen him bounce back from high-profile scandal in his personal life. In a related development, NBA superstar Stephen Curry has revealed his mind “went to a dark place” after hearing about Tiger Woods’ horror car crash. But Curry, the American basketball hero, is relieved that Woods didn’t suffer life-threatening injuries, having admitted he feared the worst when he first heard the news.
