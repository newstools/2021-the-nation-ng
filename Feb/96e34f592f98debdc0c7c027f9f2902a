Operatives of Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT), Bayelsa State Police Command, have arrested two suspected armed robbers who have been disguising as state government task force team to rob members of the public. The suspects were said to have picked their victim, a civil servant, on Imgbi Road Friday and were moving around town seeking Point of Sales (POS) outlets to make withdrawals, when the SWAT operatives swooped on them and arrested two suspects, Headman Eniyi and Ebi Tonbofa. The operatives recovered a revolver pistol with three rounds of live ammunition. Recall that the Commissioner of Police Bayelsa State Command, Mike Okoli, had earlier ordered police detectives to fish out the armed robbery gang when similar reports were made to the police command. The suspects are said to be cooperating with investigation and would be charged to court at the conclusion of the investigation. Meanwhile, authorities of the Bayelsa State Police Command have appealed to the people of the state and members of the public to remain calm as the command has launched an investigation into the drive-by shooting incident at Erepa and Agudama-epie communities in Yenagoa. The command’s spokesman, Asinim Butswat, recalled that on February 22, 2021 at about 2130 hours unidentified gunmen suspected to be cultists in an unmarked Toyota Camry car shot at some residents in front of their shop at Erepa and zoomed off. Butswat said: “Policemen responded swiftly and rescued five victims to the hospital. However, one Auwal Bashir who was fatally injured died in the hospital. The other victims are responding to treatment at the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa. “The suspected cultists proceeded to Agudama Epie at about 2145 hours and shot at one Paul Marcus Ivinbeke ‘m’ 23 years in a shop. The victim was rushed to Tobis Hospital, Akenfa where he eventually died.”
