 Nigeria international Leon Balogun’s contract with Scottish giants Rangers is set to be extended by the club soon. This is according to Rangers manager Steven Gerrard, who is keen on keeping Balogun at the club for next season. The Liverpool FC legend confirmed that the towering central defender is close to triggering an extension in his contract. Balogun has helped Rangers remain unbeaten in the Scottish Premiership this campaign and the team is placed at the top of the table. “We have six centre backs at the moment but that won’t be the case in the summer,” Gerrard was quoted as saying by the National. “Leon has something in his contract that might trigger on its own in the coming weeks. “But we don’t have to wait for that because we are really happy with the player and I want him around for next season anyway.” The former Brighton Hove and Albion player has made 22 appearances across all competitions for Rangers this campaign. Balogun signed for Rangers from English club Wigan Athletic in July 2020 on a one-year contract, with an option in the club’s favour to extend for a further year. He has played 32 international matches for Nigeria.
