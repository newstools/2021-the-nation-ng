Actor Nonso Bassey has expressed delight at working with Rita Dominic on the set of the upcoming film, ‘La Femme Anjola’. In a chat with The Nation, Bassey showered encomiums on Dominic saying her talent is phenomenal. “Rita Dominic is a grade A++ material. Working with her is a dream. Her talent is phenomenal. I learned so much from working with her. And as a producer, she went over and beyond to make sure everyone on set was comfortable enough to put in the work. Such an amazing experience,” Bassey began. Continuing, the ‘Tinsel’ actor, who played the role of Dejare Johnson in the film, described his first meeting with Dominic before filming began. He said, “I remember when the director set up our first meeting which happened in a hotel lobby, I got there early. I was so nervous I started rearranging the table and chairs. Lol. And then Rita walked in. Boy did she walk in!! She owns a room as she enters. She was gliding in the air towards me and everyone was staring at her. My mouth was so dry. Anyway, she is such a professional.” Bassey plays a romantic role who was entangled with Rita Dominic’s character after they met in an underground nightclub, where she sings to entertain guests and he plays the saxophone to back her up.
