An Ebonyi State High Court, Abakaliki Division has discharged and acquitted one Chukwudi Omeh who has been standing trial for 8 years over the death of his pregnant fiancée. Mr Omeh, who until his arrest was an engine oil trader, was accused in 2012 of killing his pregnant fiancée, Chinagorom Agama. The mutilated corpse of the deceased, a student of Ebonyi State College of Education, Ịkwọ, and her bag were discovered at the Alisaoko forest in Ohaukwu Local government area with her private part, hair and breasts missing. At the time of her death she was 3 months pregnant. Her Fiance, Mr Omeh was sponsoring her in school from proceeds of his engine oil business. The relationship, it was gathered, started in 1999 while they were in secondary school but they decided to marry in 2012. Following the discovery of her body, Mr Omeh was arrested and accused of killing the late Chinagorom and arraigned in 2013 before the court. However, the Court presided by Justice Vincent Nwanchor declared the defendant discharged and acquitted. He held that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime. The judge advised the discharged man to be grateful to God for granting him freedom by being a dedicated Christian. The prosecuting counsel for the state, Lilian Okorie blamed the inability of the police to carry our diligent investigation on the matter before charging the accused to court. She also advised the discharged man to, irrespective of the court judgement, make lasting peace with the deceased’s family members. Counsel to the defendant Cletus Nwokposi appreciated the court for discharging his client “The court has demonstrated that it is indeed the last hope of the common man,” he said. Mr Omega, while thanking the court for acquitting him, prayed for the repose of his late Fiance and unborn baby.
