234 Parts.com has introduced an online platform for the auto sector. According to its Managing Director, Godson Madu, “the website boasts of over 370,000 car parts listings with 28,000 products from over 6,000 dealers across major spare part markets in the country. Madu said: “234 parts.com inventory ranges from auto parts, lubricants, batteries, tools, wheels and tyres. The site is very easy to navigate and has been designed to make the process of buying quality replacement of parts easy and convenient by providing multiple spare parts options and price comparison to owners, while also enhancing the product visibility of the spare part dealers.” Its Chief Marketing Officer Mrs Eniola Alli-Ayodele, added that the need for genuine auto spare parts gave birth to the website and that it might bea leading platform in the sector. “From our research, with the influx of foreign used cars in Nigeria; usually over five years old at the time of their arrival, there is a significant increase in maintenance visits from four times to 12 times annually. It has been recorded that each of those visits involves a parts replacement purchase. Consequently, the presence of substandard new spare parts increases as the manufacturers of these foreign used cars discontinue production of some of the car’s parts.” “The focus of the platform is to hold the largest inventory of used and new automotive spare parts, and increase access to the platform by using its rich data and insights to organise the fragmented spare parts industry. “The business will in the coming months penetrate other major cities in the nation and onboard additional spare parts dealers after a rigorous verification. This new development promises to create an opportunity for OEMs and genuine spare parts vendors to compete while also increasing the chances of car owners getting guaranteed parts.”
