A group under the aegis of Elders of Ikeja Division Forum, an arm of IBILE Forum, has objected to the proposed Division delineation bill proposed by the Lagos State House of Assembly. According to the group, part of this is clandestine plan to merge Kosofe and Somolu Local Government Areas presently in Ikeja Division with Ikorodu Division and cession of Alimosho from Ikeja Division to Badagry Division. In a press release signed by the President, Ikeja Divisin Forum, M.A Agbabiaka, the group said: “We are also aware of the conspiracy to excise some Awori communities from Eti-Osa to Epe and call on well-meaning indigenes of Lagos State to resist and condemn every distrustful attempt being made to take Awori communities from their ancestral homes in Ikeja and Lagos Divisions through undue delineation/adjustment of administrative divisions. “As major stakeholders in the State, we make bold to state that those sponsoring the obnoxious bill lack adequate knowledge of the history, culture and predispositions of the people of Lagos State. “This underground move will cause nothing but inter-indigenous conflict, undue tension and disunity among the people of the five administrative divisions that have been living harmoniously for over five decades, if the obnoxious bill sees the light of the day.” He said Lagos State is made up of various ethnic groups, including the Aworis, Ijebus, Eguns and (Ogu). Besides, the group tasked the Lagos State House of Assembly to expose and educate the authors of the bill of the dangers inherent in rewriting the history of Lagos State people and urged them to be cautious against accommodating the bill, saying it could destroy the unity and peace that exist among Lagosians.
