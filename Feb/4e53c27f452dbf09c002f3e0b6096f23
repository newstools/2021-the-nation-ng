Son of the ex-Chairman, defunct Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, Faisal, has escaped to the United States of America (USA) after sneaking into the Niger Republic through one of the nation’s porous borders in Borno State. A lawyer with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mohammed Abubakar, confirmed the development on Thursday at the resumed hearing in his money laundering trial before Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Faisal, who is being tried before the same judge with his father, went underground, the same way Maina did after they were granted bail. While Maina was re-arrested in Niger Republic and has since been ordered to be remanded in Kuje prison, Abuja, his son had remained elusive until EFCC got intelligence that he has since fled to the US where he is believed to be a citizen. Abubakar told the court on Thursday from the information at the disposal of the anti-graft agency, Faisal sneaked to the USA through the Republic of Niger. In a ruling earlier, Justice Abang ordered among others, that a House of Representatives member, Sani Dan-Galadima (representing Kaura-Namoda Federal Constituency of Zamfara), who stood surety for the fleeing Faisal, should forfeit his property, worth N60million, which he pledged as guarantee for the N60m bail bond he signed.
