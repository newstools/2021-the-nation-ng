President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Melvin Pinnick, yesterday presided over a meeting to chart a more robust course for sustainability and improvement of the organisation of the various leagues: Nigeria Professional Football League, Nigeria National League, Nigeria Women Football League and the Nigeria Nationwide League One. The meeting, which also had in attendance members of the Executive Committee deliberated on niggling issues around the League particularly welfare of officials and resolved to tackle matters head-on in the interest of the domestic game. Pinnick, delighted with the broadcast and quality of production of Nigeria Professional Football League matches on the Nigeria Television Authority and the NPFL.TV, said the Federation was determined that no factor would be allowed to derail the present gains as the NPFL season enters Week 10, and the NNL and NWFL matches also trudge on. “We are all impressed with the matches being on television and the special app (NPFL.TV) and have enjoyed the quality of production which compares to the very best anywhere. However, it is time to look critically at certain niggling factors and ensure we tackle them decisively in order not to erode the gains we have been able to make. “We must keep at what we are doing, maintain the standard and even strive for improvement where possible, and we can be sure that we will reap the gains in the coming seasons,” Pinnick said. The NFF supremo also assured that the Federation will do everything within its capacity to ensure that standard of officiating continues to improve, while safety, security and medical issues are given the utmost attention and seriousness.
