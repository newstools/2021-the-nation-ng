The Lagos State government will shut down the Third Mainland Bridge from midnight of Friday, February 26, till midnight of Saturday. Transportation Commissioner Frederic Oladeinde announced this in a statement yesterday. He said the total closure of the bridge is to enable the contractors move the equipment used during the repairs of the bridge and allow the Oworonshoki and Adeniji-bound lanes to open fully to traffic. Dr. Oladeinde advised motorists approaching the bridge from Ogudu, Alapere and Gbagada to use Ikorodu Road, Jibowu and Yaba as alternative routes, while traffic from Lagos-Island, Iddo, Oyingbo, Adekunle and Yaba towards Iyana Oworonshoki are to use Herbert Macaulay Way, Jibowu and Ikorodu Road as alternative routes. The commissioner assured the residents that traffic management personnel would be deployed in the affected routes to minimise and address any traffic impediment during the closure. Praising Lagosians for their cooperation during the prolonged repairs of the bridge, Dr. Oladeinde stressed that the bridge is now safe for all to use.
