THE non-availability of the Kano State Attorney-General (AG), Musa Lawan, yesterday stalled the re-arraignment of seven suspects for alleged abduction of nine children. The matter was slated for re-arraignment of the defendants before Justice Zuwaira Yusuf of the Kano State High Court. The Attorney-General charged Paul Owne, Mercy Paul, Ebere Ogbono, Emmanuel Igwe, Loise Duru, Monica Oracha and Chinelo Ifedegwu with 38 counts, bordering on conspiracy, kidnapping and selling of children from Kano to Anambra. At the resumed sitting, the Prosecution Counsel, Mr. Wada A. Wada, told the court he was directed by the AG to apply for an adjournment to enable him attend the court sitting. The defence counsel, C.A. Olorisade, however objected to the application, urging the court not to entertain the application as no cogent reason was given to grant the adjournment. In her ruling, Justice Zuwaira Yusuf granted the application on the grounds that this was the first time the prosecution was seeking an adjournment. Zuwaira adjourned the case until March 12, for re-arraignment.
