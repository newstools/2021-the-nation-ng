An Ogba Magistratesâ€™ Court on Monday remanded two Chinese nationals Huzhi Neng and Zhang Chuanhong in Police custody for alleged impersonation. Magistrate A. O. Adigun, who ordered their remand, said they should remain in custody pending legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). The Intelligence Response Team of the Nigeria Police had arraigned them on a five-count charge offence bordering on impersonation before Magistrate Adigun. The incident occurred at No 8, Adeyeri close, Off Opebi Road, Ikeja between January 28, 2017, and October 31, 2020. According to the Police Counsel, Nosa Watson Uhumwango, the defendants were alleged to have been recklessly and in a negligent manner, given medical treatment to patients without license of operation leading to the death of many victims. Uhumwango said the defendants, with the intent to defraud, did falsely represent themselves to be qualified Medical Practitioners and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 380 af the Criminal Law of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015. The defendants pleaded not guilty to all the charges after a Chinese Interpreter read the charge to them. Subsequently, the prosecutor asked the court for a trial date. He also said that the Police have three witnesses in court. Defence counsel, B.E. Lana however urged the court to grant them bail in very liberal terms. Lana said the defendants did not abuse the administrative bail granted to them by Police during an investigation period. In his ruling, Magistrate A. O. Adigun declined their bail application. He ordered the Police to transfer the case file to the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. The matter has been adjourned till March 15.
