The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Major General Ibrahim Attahiru, has issued a 48-hour dateline for troops of ‘Operation Lafiya Dole’ to recapture Marte from Boko Haram terrorists and clear other adjoining villages, including  Kirenowa, kirta, Wulgo, Chikingudo communities of Marte and Ngala local government areas in Borno State. Attahiru gave the order on Sunday while addressing troops of the Nigerian Army Super camp 9, Dikwa. He assured the troops of the needed support to carry out the task, which he said must be done within 48 hours. “Areas around Marte, Chikingudu, Wulgo  Kirenowa and Kirta must be cleared in the next 48 hours. You should be rest assured of all support you required in this very onerous task. ”I have just spoken to the Theater Commander, and the General Officer Commanding 7 Division, you must not let this nation down. Go back and do the needful and I will be right behind you,” Attahiru ordered. The Chief of Army Staff also warned troops not to allow themselves to be over-run by Boko Haram insurgents, stressing “you are aware of the recent attack on Dikwa and Marte, you should not allow this to happen again, go after them and clear these bastards”. The Army helmsman, while appreciating efforts of the troops in the fight against Boko Haram, promised to be committed to the welfare of the soldiers by rotating them from the theatre as well as continue to visit them regularly to boost their morale.
