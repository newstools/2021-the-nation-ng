Former Gombe Governor, Senator Danjuma Goje, on Wednesday said there is no need for any legal argument over the ongoing membership registration/validation exercise of the party. Goje’s statement is coming on the heels of some argument on whether the registration/validation exercise is constitutional or unconstitutional. Responding to question from The Nation over the legality of the exercise after his registration at his ward in Kachere, Goje said the exercise as far as he is concerned is going on smoothly, which is all that matters. “I don’t want to go into any legal argument on this matter because there is no need for it. As you can see the exercise is going on smoothly and that is all that matters. “I want to advise all our party members to make sure they come out and register and keep their card very well because it is your weapon to realize your political ambition,” he said. The Senator representing Gombe Central arrived in a convoy of his supporters around 1: pm and moved straight to the registration venue beside his country home at Kachere where he was formally registered. He thanked the party leadership at state and national levels for making the exercise a hitch-free one adding “this will further strengthen the party across the country. The APC chieftain also addressed party supporters who besieged the venue of the registration to remain calm and be peaceful during the exercise. He also appealed to them to remain resolute in their support for the ruling party as we move closer to the 2023 general election. “We want to build a strong and virile party that will ensure even representation for all without ethnic or religious bias. We believe that our party will continue to come out stronger and stronger after every election,” he said.
