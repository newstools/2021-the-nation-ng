The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Saturday threw his weight behind the party’s former interim National Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande, who criticised the party’s Caretaker Committee and the ongoing national registration and revalidation exercise. Akande had faulted the creation of the APC Caretaker and extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committees and the ongoing exercise initiated by the committee, which he dismissed as wasteful. Tinubu told reporters in Lagos that he saw nothing to remove from Akande’s position but could only endorse it. Speaking after revalidating his own membership of the party, the former Lagos State Governor said: “Since we have a foundation and that foundation is on which the structure up till the present was built at the time of the registration of this party, I will not fault Baba Akande’s position. I will not but endorse it. He added: “What we are doing now is a matter of addition and subtraction, free entry and free exit. “You have joined a particular party; you have decided to leave that party. You have equal opportunity for new members to join and update the existing register of the party.” He said he was not aware that the party’s register which was submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at the time of APC registration has been invalidated. He said that although the APC has witnessed several congresses and exits, it has complied with the nation’s Electoral Act.
