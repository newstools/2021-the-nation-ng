The Conference of Concerned Nigeria Security Experts has cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari against sectional and political considerations in the appointment of leadership in the country, especially security. The concerned Nigerians urged President Buhari to evenly spread appointments into sensitive security positions for best results. In a statement jointly signed by their National President, Prof Otedola Adekunle and National Secretary, Dr Christy Aklo, the security experts warned the complex and sensitive nature of defence and security architecture all over the world abhours sectional and political considerations in appointment of leaders. According to the experts, this warning was informed by the deteriorating security situation occasioned by insurgency in the North East, armed banditry in the North West and parts of North Central, herders’ menace in the South West, as well as militancy in the South South. The experts stated the plural and multi-dimensional nature of Nigeria opens actions and policies of government – no matter how well-intentioned – to subjective scrutiny, based on which divide is driving the psychology of perception. The security experts argued that the perpetuation of insurgency, banditry and other violent crimes in the North may not be unconnected to the concentration of military, security and para-military heads from that section of the country. They noted in the course of executing their mandate, there arises an inadvertent natural inclination and sentimental attachment which, in the final analysis, creates setbacks. They appealed to Buhari to reconsider his exclusion of the South East from national affairs. They noted the region’s contribution in the fight against terror would go a long way in tackling the problem of insecurity in the country. The experts enjoined leaders to pay attention to the needs of all sections of the polity, address concerns, and as much as possible, avoid the use of force, where dialogue is inevitable.
