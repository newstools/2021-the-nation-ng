The Vice Presidential Candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, in 2019 elections, Mr Peter Obi, on Friday, February 5, 2021, joined family, friends and well-wishers of ex-Rangers Footballer, Late  Nwabueze Nwankwor, also known as ‘Bulldozer’, to bid him farewell as he was laid to rest in his country home at Enugwu-Ukwu, Anambra State. Addressing journalists after the event, Obi said he was there to pay respect to the deceased for his contributions to Rangers Football Club, Igbo Land, South East and the entire nation at large. Obi said Nwabueze was a foundation member of Rangers Football Club, where he passionately contributed to sports development. Obi lamented the apparent neglect, in old age, which befalls great men who had sacrificed a lot to make society better, in their hay days. He said a man like Nwankwor Nwabueze, who was a onetime Green Eagles captain, deserved to be well celebrated. “I have observed, with interest, the kind of attention given to great men and women who have faithfully served and contributed to their countries globally, even during burials.  I followed Maradona’s burial and was marvelled at the level of respect he was given even at death. That showed how his country appreciates his contributions to their football development.
