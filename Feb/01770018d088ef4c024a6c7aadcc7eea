 WIFE of hospitalized ex-international Yisa Sofoluwe has called on football stakeholders in the country to come to the assistance of her husband who is lying unconscious at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). The former Super Eagles defender was diagnosed for mild cerebral atrophy and has been on life support since Thursday. Speaking through Waidi Akanni, former Lagos State Football Association chairman, Waidi Akanni, she called on the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Lagos State government, football stakeholders and well meaning Nigerians to support her ailing husband at this time of his need. While lauding Seyi Akinwunmi, the NFF first vice-president, for his support   towards moving Sofoluwe from Prince and Life Medical Hospital, Ikorodu, Lagos, to LUTH, she informed that they need the financial support of all. “I would like to thank Barrister Akinwunmi for responding quickly to our call when we had to move him from Ikorodu to LUTH; however Sofoluwe’s case is very critical now. He needs the financial assistance of well meaning Nigerians. He has been on oxygen for many days.” Sofoluwe had 40 caps and scored one goal for Nigeria and was a member of the Eagles squads which reached the final of the 1984 and 1988 AFCON tournaments. Nicknamed ‘Minister of Defence’ by late sport commentator Ernest Okonkwo, Sofoluwe played regularly for the Nigeria senior team, Super Eagles as a left back between 1983 and 1988.
