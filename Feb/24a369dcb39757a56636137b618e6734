The Lagos State Government will shut down the Third Mainland Bridge for 24 hours from midnight Friday, February 26th to midnight Saturday. The Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde who made this known in a statement issued on Wednesday, said the total closure of the bridge is to enable the contractors move the equipment used during the rehabilitation process off the bridge and allow both the Oworonshoki and Adeniji bound lanes open fully to traffic. Oladeinde therefore, advised motorists approaching the bridge from Ogudu, Alapere and Gbagada to use Ikorodu Road, Jibowu and Yaba, as alternative routes, while Iyana Oworoshoki-bound traffic from Lagos-Island, Iddo, Oyingbo, Adekunle and Yaba are to use Herbert Macaulay Way, Jibowu and Ikorodu Road as alternative routes. The Commissioner assured that traffic management personnel would be deployed along the affected routes to minimize and address any traffic impediments during the closure. Commending Lagosians for their cooperation during the prolonged repair works of the Bridge, the Commissioner assured that the bridge is now safe for use by all and sundry.
