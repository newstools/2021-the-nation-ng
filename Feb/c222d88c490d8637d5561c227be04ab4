Kwara State government at the weekend said it has carried out COVID-19 test on no fewer than 17,581 persons. The state has an estimated total population of 3.6 million. An epidemiologist at the state Ministry of Health, Dr. Khadijah Kamaldeen, said this in Ilorin, the state capital, at a sensitisation workshop for reporters on COVID-19 update across the state’s 16 local government areas. Dr. Kamaldeen added that the state had equipped 12 testing laboratories in the LGs to cater for the teeming population. “The testing centres is to afford people to go and test for their status, adding that some LGA have higher burden cases of the Coronavirus than others. “The state had so far conducted sample test of about 17, 581 samples, with 2,096 confirmed cases as at fourth week of 2021,” she said.  She confirmed that 45 people had so far died of the diseases, with 385 active cases. The epidemiologist explained that Ilorin South and Ilorin West had the highest confirmed cases while Patigi and Lafiagi had no confirmed cases. She, however, observed that the lack of cases of the disease in these LGAs may be due to low testing rate, as these communities were hard to reach areas. Also in her presentation, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Risk Communicator and Community Engagement, Mrs. Fatimah Mustapha, said COVID-19 had truly shown that the world is a global village. “The data also disclosed women had the highest confirmed cases at 53.6 per cent while men are at 46.4 per cent. The age ranges of people with the highest suspected cases are from 25 to 29 years of age,” she said. She urged the people to make judicious use of these testing laboratories and get tested for the disease.
