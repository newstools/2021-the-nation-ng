Mikel Arteta has revealed how he and his family suffered threats on social media, with Arsenal having spoken to their players to offer advice and warn about the dangers of online abuse. Arteta is one of the few managers with a Twitter account – and 1.5million followers – but the Spaniard no longer logs on, saying he would ‘have to stay in bed’ if he did. His family was targeted and the club addressed the issue internally, though Arteta says he no longer checks his social media because he fears it would have a heavy impact on him. ‘We are all exposed in this industry to that and that’s why I prefer not to read because it would affect me personally, much more the moment somebody wants to touch my family,’ Arteta said. ‘It happened, the club was aware of it and we tried to do something about it. That’s it. We have to live with it. It is not going to stop tomorrow, we know that, but medium, long term, can we do something about it? That’s what I am pushing for.’
