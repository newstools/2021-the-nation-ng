An inferno swept through Iddo/Otto in Ebute Meta, Lagos Mainland Local Government, destroying eight warehouses and shanty structures. The fire that started around 5pm on Sunday raged on till early hours of Monday. According to the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), the fire broke out behind in the shanties near the warehouses at the Iddo Rail Terminus due to a power surge when the public power supply was restored. preliminary investigation by the State Fire and Rescue Service showed that the fire was caused by the carelessness of the shanty inhabitants. Acting Controller, Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Mrs. Margaret Adeseye, said the agency saved 23 warehouses from being razed. LASEMA Director-General/Chief Executive Officer Dr Olufemi Damilola Oke-Osanyintolu said: “While there appears to be no loss of life, the agency is working alongside the Lagos and Federal Fire Services to control the fire and curtail the extensive spread of the flames. “The fire which ignited in the shanties and escalated to the warehouse behind the terminus, was still raging as at 2am on Monday due to the storage of combustible materials such as torchlights, batteries and cigarette lighters in the warehouse. “Concerted efforts were exerted in the overnight operation by LASEMA and other stakeholders, to extinguish the fire by the Agency’s Response Team, alongside the LRU Fire, Lagos State Fire Service and Federal Fire service, in the ongoing operation.” some passengers were injured while scampering for safety yesterday morning when a BRT went up in flames on Ikorodu Road.
