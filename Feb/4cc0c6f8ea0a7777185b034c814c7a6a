Nigeria international Samuel Chukwueze has undergone successful surgery on his groin according to his Spanish club, Villarreal CF. The speedy winger picked up the injury during Villarreal’s 4-0 win over Celta Vigo in a La Liga game early last month. The Yellow Submarine have now announced that the 21-year-old player and his teammate Ruben Pena underwent operations. “Samuel Chukwueze, who has been out injured receiving treatment for discomfort in his groin, has undergone surgery this morning [Thursday] by Doctor Ulrike Muschaweck in Munich, hoping to definitively relieve him of the said pain,” a club statement read. “Ruben Pena suffered muscle damage to his left hamstring in yesterday’s Copa del Rey quarter-final against Levante. Both footballers’ recovery time will depend on how they progress.” Chukwueze, who has netted once in 17 La Liga games this season, recently became the youngest centurion for Villarreal.
