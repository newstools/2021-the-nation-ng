Goalkeeper Alisson endured another horror show as Liverpool’s fading title hopes suffered a near fatal blow with a 3-1 defeat at top four rivals Leicester City. Jurgen Klopp’s champions dominated for most of the contest and took a deserved lead through Mohamed Salah’s 23rd goal of the season. However, the Foxes levelled when VAR overturned an offside decision that had initially ruled out James Maddison’s free kick 12 minutes from time. Alisson then collided with the Reds’ debutant, Ozan Kabak just moments later to allow Jamie Vardy to gleefully race clear and fire into an empty net. Harvey Barnes put the icing on a dramatic late turnaround with a clinical third as the visiting defence stood in stunned disarray. The result sees Leicester move up to second, four points off leaders Manchester City having played two games more. Liverpool, who are now six points behind the Foxes, stay fourth for now but look set to face a real battle for Champions League qualification. Klopp confirmed Liverpool’s title defence is over after his side fell to a 3-1 defeat at Leicester on Saturday afternoon. When asked if he is conceding the league title in his post-match interview, Klopp bluntly told reporters: “Yes. The Reds boss added: “I don’t think we can close that gap this year. We have to win football games. Today was really good in parts. We have to avoid mistakes and misunderstanding. “We cannot avoid VAR mistakes but in our hands we have to avoid it.” It has been a hectic season so far – so make sure you don’t miss a single thing by signing up for the brilliant new Mirror Football newsletter!
