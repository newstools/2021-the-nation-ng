Edo State has recorded 30 new cases and two more deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total number of deaths recorded in the second wave to 30. The state COVID-19 Incident Manager, Dr. Andrew Obi, stated this in a virtual meeting of his task force, chaired by Governor Godwin Obaseki. Obi urged residents to adhere to guidelines against the spread of the deadly virus, especially maintaining social distance, regular washing of hands with soap under running water and the compulsory use of facemasks in public. Obi, who decried the rise in the number of COVID-19 related deaths in the state, noted that Edo State is facing a more violent strain of the virus in the second wave of the pandemic than the first. According to him, “Edo State has, in the last 24 hours, recorded 30 new cases of COVID-19, two more deaths, 15 new recoveries, with 617 active cases. “The new fatality figure brings to 30, the total number of deaths recorded in the state since December 01, 2020 when the state started tracking the second wave of the pandemic.” Obi added: “While the government intensifies measures to contain the spread of the deadly virus, it is imperative for all residents to strictly adhere with all health and safety protocols, especially maintaining social distance, regular washing of hands with soap under running water and compulsory use of facemasks in public. “Adherence to these guidelines will ensure that all citizens remain safe and healthy, especially our elderly population who are most vulnerable to this virus.”
