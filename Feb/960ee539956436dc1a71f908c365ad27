Sociable Lagos-based lawyer, Rasheedat Oyeronke Ajide, and her siblings recently celebrated the 30th memorial anniversary of their late father, Alhaji Abdulraheem Adetokunboh Ajide, who died in February, 1991. The service held at FESTAC, Lagos was graced by top Muslim clerics, socialites and politicians, one of whom would later laud the benevolence of Ronke, the first and only daughter of the late devoted Muslim. The former chairman of Amuwo Odofin L.C.D.A, Ayo Adewale, recalled how Ajide gave her the first car, Toyota Yaris, he used for all his political campaigns and never returned to seek favour when he finally ran for office and won. Adewale said she had the opportunity to walk into his office to ask for one political favour or the other, but chose never to ask for such gratification. He added that it must have been a virtue she imbibed from her late father. Ronkeâ€™s siblings who also played major roles at the ceremony included Fatai Olukayode Ajide, Ahmed Olanrewaju Ajide, and Yusuf Ajide.
