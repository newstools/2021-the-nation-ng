Kwara has directed temporary closure of ten grant-aided secondary schools in Ilorin, the state capital, pending the resolution of the hijaab controversy in the affected schools. The schools are C&S College, ST. Anthony College, ECWA School, Surulere Baptist Secondary School, Bishop Smith Secondary School, CAC Secondary School, St. Barnabas Secondary School, St. John School, St. Williams Secondary School and St. James Secondary School all in Ilorin metropolis. Some of the schools had earlier on Friday allegedly locked out some hijab-wearing students. Last Wednesday, some Muslims organisations had urged the state government to impress it on authorities of the affected schools to allow their female students wear hijab. This prompted a meeting between governemnt and leaders of Christians and Muslims in the state on Thursday. At the meeting presided over by Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi, the state urged all the parties to bury their differences and allow peace to reign. In a statement Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development Mrs. Kemi Adeosun said that “the closure comes as a government committee comprising representatives of the Muslim and Christian communities meets today to iron out the differences between the two communities. “Further communication will be issued to inform members of the public on the development. “Government calls for calm and urges parents and religious leaders to avoid actions or comments that may further split the two communities.”
