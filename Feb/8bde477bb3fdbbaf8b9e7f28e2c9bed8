Miffed by the rising wave of white-collar crimes, the Chairman and Founder of AfroRedFlag White-Collar Protective Shield Limited, Dr. Mannixs Paul has called for more collaborative effort aimed at tackling the menace in Africa. Paul spoke recently at the launching of the AfroRedflag 2021 Innovation Drive for Africa held virtually in Abuja, Lagos and Bayelsa. According to him, over the years, most African governments have made several efforts to fight white-collar crimes and corruption, adding that based on the report of Transparency International Corruption index report most African countries including Nigeria are among the countries that are regressive in the fight against fraud and corruption. He noted that regardless of the statistical data analysis, which supports the retrogressive outcomes in most African countries, some relevant laws and policies are in place to regulate those shortcomings and deterrence. Also speaking, the Auditor General, Republic of Ghana, Mr. Daniel Yaw Domelevo lamented the spate of crime in workplace across African states, which according to him undermines democracy, violate human rights, exacerbate human insecurity and help the poor disproportionately. Echoing similar sentiments, a Forensic Psychologist, Dr Tersoo Shaapera said the traditional methods of fighting crime had been “seriously overstretched from arrest, prosecution and then conviction.” On her part, a Technical Consultant with the Group, Mrs. Caroline Ndubuisi, called for sustained effort to nip corruption in the bud for a better nation. The event brought together economic experts, government representative, IT experts from the United State of America, Africa, Asia and United Kingdom.
