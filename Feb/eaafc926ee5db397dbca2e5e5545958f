The Presidency has declared that many herders are undergoing trials in several parts of the country for alleged killings and criminal activities. It challenged the Nigeria Police Force to publish the names of herders undergoing trials. It also absolved President Muhammadu Buhari of any complicity in the herdsmen crisis across the nation. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, stated while speaking on Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’ programme monitored by The Nation. He said: “The president is more than concerned of the ongoing situation, he is fully conscious of the fact that it is the responsibility of his government to work with Nigerians to secure lives and stop the ongoing crisis whether they are kidnappings or the new line of ethnic violence. He condemns it and he does not support it. “Having spoken against it, it follows that all security agencies must take their line of action from the president’s remark and do that which is necessary which is to stop the escalation of the violent attacks being witnessed in some parts of the country and ensure that it does not go beyond where it has been recorded.” Shehu also described as “uncharitable”, comments made against Buhari, adding that many criminal herders are being prosecuted. “I hope the headquarters of the police will take responsibility and publish the full list of Fulani herders who are undergoing trials in various states particularly in Benue State. “Trials are going on, convictions have been made and the president cannot be complicit. It is very uncharitable. The president cannot be complicit in the kinds of things being said of him,” he added. Shehu said Buhari is not a “showman” adding that the security agencies are working to tackle the situation.
