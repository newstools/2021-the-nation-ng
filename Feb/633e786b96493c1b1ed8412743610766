A high court in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, has sentenced six youths to death for armed robbery. The convicts, one of whom a final-year student of Modibbo Adama University, Yola, were found guilty of mounting illegal roadblocks and stealing from passengers at gunpoint. Justice Abdulazeez Waziri of the state High Court 4 said they deserved no less a punishment for their act. In the course of the prosecution, which took nearly six years, the prosecutors called eight witnesses and tendered six documents as exhibits. The prosecution told the court that the defendants had on August 29 and 31, 2015 mounted an illegal road block on a bridge along the grossly dilapidated Savannah Sugar Company section of the Lafia-Numan highway. They, allegedly while armed with single-barrelled guns, locally made pistols, cutlasses and knives and wearing military jackets, mounted the roadblock with drums and stones and robbedÂ  travellers of phones, money and other valuables.
