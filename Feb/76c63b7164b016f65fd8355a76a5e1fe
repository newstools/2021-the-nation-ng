The man who inspired the now-viral ‘lori iro’ video, Gbadamosi Ismail, has joined social media. The Oyo-based evangelist has continued to make the headlines since a viral video of him preaching about ‘common sugar-coated lies’ used in relationships surfaced online. The video, which comes days before Valentine’s Day, has elicited a flurry of hilarious reactions from Nigerians. ‘Lori iro’ is a Yoruba phrase that means “on top lies” in English. In the now-viral video, he said: “You’re honey, lori iro, my biscuit, lori iro, my chocolate, lori iro, my tomato, lori iro, my onion, lori iro, my puff puff, lori iro, my sugarcane, lori iro… they’re lies. Lie lie lovers are not now rampant. Too much lies..” The Nation checks revealed he has garnered over 8,000 followers on Instagram while over 1000 users followed him on Twitter a few days after opening his accounts. “I am Evangelist Gbadamosi Ismail, I preach the gospel with all that I have and all that I am! Hence the many nicknames e.g. Baba Lie Lie, Evang. lro po etc,” his bio on Twitter reads. The evangelist described his sudden rise to fame as a dream while appreciating his fans. “It’s still like a dream, but this is the best dream anyone can have! I appreciate all of you my followers, may God’s presence never depart from you now and forever! I love you all….this is not #loriiro,” he had said. Meanwhile, The Haven Nation, an Ibadan-based church, has enlisted Gbadamosi Ismail for its Valentine buffet service.
