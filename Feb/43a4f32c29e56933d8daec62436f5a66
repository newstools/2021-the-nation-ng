The Bauchi State Police Command has arrested a 28-year-old suspected ritualist named Rufa’i Yunusa for culpable homicide after he allegedly killed a girl brought to him for traditional treatment. The incident was said to have occurred on February 16. Police said Yunusa’s arrest followed a complaint lodged on February 17 by the girl’s father Isyaku Ahmed. Isyaku reportedly took his daughter to Yunusa who claimed to be a native doctor,  for  traditional heaaling after he told him that his daughter was suffering from a spiritual ailment. Yunusa then solicited for, and got N10,000 from the father, after which he took the little girl into the forest purportedly for a spiritual healing session only to return after a while to inform the girl’s father that she  had mysteriously disappeared during the process. Police reportedly found the girl’s body in the forest. The girl was not Yunusa’s first victim, it was said. He had reportedly killed three other children between ages of two and four. A knife and 26 children’s clothing were reportedly found on the suspect.
