Three persons have been killed by gunmen suspected to be assassins in Nkpor, Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State. The deceased were said to be holding a meeting when the assailants numbering about five stormed the area and went straight to the hall. The Nation gathered that three of the gunmen moved straight to each of their targets and gunned them down at close range, which triggered a stampede as people scampered for safety. Police spokesman Haruna Mohammed said bodies of the deceased were deposited at the mortuary for autopsy while efforts were on to apprehend perpetrators of the heinous act. Mohammed further revealed that two expended ammunition of 7.62mm were recovered at the scene as exhibits, adding that the case was under investigation to unravel the circumstances surrounding the incident.
