Members of Eerule Olamide family in Shagamu, Ogun State, have urged Governor Dapo Abiodun to reject any document(s) presented by Premier Standard Ltd for the purpose of obtaining title in respect of an expanse of land situated at Kilometre 55, Lagos-Ibadan, Expressway, Ogun State. The family in an affidavit of sale of family land sworn to by the Head, Hammed Sesan Ogunyanwo, at the High Court of Ogun State, said at no time was any part of their land sold to Premier Standard Ltd or its agent, privy or attorney. The family said any document sought to be used for obtaining any title document on their family land without tracing the root of title to Maku family is fraudulent. Ogunyanwo said his family has been in possession of the expanse of land situated at Kilometre 55, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State without any disturbance. He said his family became owners of the land by inheritance from their forefathers called Soomo, who were the first settlers over the land, adding that members of his family have exercised possessory rights over the land for a long time without any opposition from anyone. According to him, the family has only sold parts of the land to Jianke Dai and that no other part of the land has been sold to any other person(s). He said: “Any other person(s) claiming to have bought any piece of the land from my family is lying.” The document said: ‘’That at no time was any part of the land sold to Premier Standard Ltd or its agent, privy or attorney. That any document sought to be used for the purpose of obtaining any title document without tracing its root of title to my family is fraudulent. The remainder of the land is still within the possession of my family.’’
