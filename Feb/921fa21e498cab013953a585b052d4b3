Five hotels operating within the jurisdiction of Aba North Local Government Area of Abia State have been sealed by the local council COVID-19 sensitisation/monitoring team. Our correspondent gathered that the team sealed the hotels due to what it described as public negligence and poor compliance to COVID-19 protocols as directed by the government. A source, who spoke with our correspondent, warned that the people who failed to comply with the state government’s directives on COVID-19 will soon be arrested and prosecuted at the mobile court. In a related development, the Abia State government has banned night clubs and cultural activities.  The government, in a statement by the chairman of the state COVID-19 committee and Secretary to the State Government, Chris Ezem, on Monday threatened that eateries and hoteliers who contravene the COVID-19 protocols by the state government would pay N100, 000 fine. According to Ezem, burials and wedding ceremonies are now restricted to 50 persons and churches are to accommodate 50 persons per stream. This is even as the state government has made wearing of face masks compulsory, warning that any contravention will attract a fine of N5,000. “Whilst night vigil and crusades are totally banned. All religious places of worship must pass at its entrances’ “No face masks, No entry” sign. “All COVID-19 market committees are to be revived and must ensure total compliance with COVID-19 protocols at all markets, failing which government will not hesitate to shut down such market and proscribe its union.”
