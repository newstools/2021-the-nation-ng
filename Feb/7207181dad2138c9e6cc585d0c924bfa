Drug and alcohol mention in music can influence adolescents and teens to engage in substance abuse – especially with successful artistes making it “okay” and “cool” to get drunk. Daniel Damilola Nejo, better known as RainyMilli, a London-based musician begs to differ. In his latest single “What’s Cool?” he speaks on the glamourisation of drugs while asking vital questions. Using his background as a story, he talks about growing up and watching his father abuse alcohol and cigarettes, which later led to health issues before he passed away. The new single also touches on other personal topics and issues he faces, and ordinary people can also relate to. According to RainyMilli, the goal of the song is to question what the society deems to be “cool.”
