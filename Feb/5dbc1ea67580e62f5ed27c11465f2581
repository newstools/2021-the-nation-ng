 Quadri Aruna’s TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell are aiming for doubles victories in this weekend’s Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL) matches after losing all their last four league matches. With the home defeat to Borussia Dusseldorf still fresh in their memory, Aruna and his teammates are hoping for a possible away victory tomorrow against Schwalbe Bergneustadt while on Sunday, they are expected to host bottom-placed Grenzau at home. “We mustn’t underestimate an opponent, but we don’t need to make ourselves smaller than we are. The performance in the last few weeks has been good, now we want to reward ourselves. After four defeats in a row, it’s about time,” TTC Fulda Vice President Claus-Dieter Schad stated matter-of-factly. Like TTC Fulda, Schwalbe Bergneustadt had suffered four defeats from the last four games and they will also be aiming to end the slide. Yet Aruna who had suffered four individual defeats in their last four matches believes it is high time they raised their game and get back to winning ways: “I must admit that it has not been easy in the last three weeks because in one of the matches we had played so far this year, I was exposed to cold weather at the training station and this has really affected me health-wise. “But now I am better and I hope we can turn things around this weekend and get back to our winning form that we started this year,” the Nigerian star said.
