Chief of Army Staff Maj.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, has promised to evolve a comprehensive rotation of troops that have overstayed in the theatre of war in the Northeast and other parts of the country. He also promised to join forces with foreign countries, especially Cameroon, Chad and Niger Republic, to end the over one decade of Boko Haram insurgency in the region. Attahiru spoke on Tuesday during his maiden operational visit to the theatre of war in the Northeast. He was at Operation Lafiya Dole (OPLD) formations, including the Ngamdu Army Super Camp I, which is on the boundary of Borno and Yobe states. The visit, according to him, was meant to get first-hand information from the troops, boost their morale and make a critical assessment of what was on the ground in order to get good results. Attahiru was a Commander of OPLD before he was replaced by Maj.-Gen. Rogers Nicholas. He said: “I know the issue of overstay in the mission has been a major problem. We will not do that almost immediately. But rest assured that in the next couple of weeks or months, we shall have a standard rotation plan that most of you will leave the theatre to replace and be replaced by some other soldiers so that we can continue the war.”
