Two members of Biafra Independence Movement and Movement for Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra (BIM – MASSOB) have regained their freedom, the group’s leader, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike has said. The duo, Mr. Casmir Ani and Nwoba Richard from Oji river region of Enugu state were on their way to Owerri on January 30, for a meeting with their leader, Chief Uwazuruike when they were allegedly arrested at Mgbidi in Oru west LGA by men of the 34 Artillery Brigade, Obinze in Imo state, who mistook them for IPOB’s Eastern Security Network members. Uwazuruike who confirmed their release in a statement signed by the Director of Information/ Senior Special Assistant to the President of Biafra Internal Government on Media and Publicity, Elder Chris Mocha gave the victory to his non-violent quest to actualize Biafra as a Sovereign Nation. He said the members were freed after soldiers investigated and confirmed from him that the arrested members belonged to BIM -MASSOB now Biafra Internal Government. “This latest release of detained BIM -MASSOB members by men of the 34 Artillery Brigade, Obinze, has brought to 17 of such incidents in the past six months after Biafra was admitted and inducted as the 46th member of Unrepresented Nations and people’s organization on July 31 – August 2, 2020. “It was learnt that Soldiers from the Brigade freed the two members after Uwazuruike identified them not belonging to the proscribed Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB),” the statement read. While insisting that non-violence remained the greatest weapon to achieve independence, Uwazuruike urged his loyalists of BIM – MASSOB to follow the laid down principle from the beginning to the end of the struggle. “Biafra is now dealing and relating with Sovereign Nations and International Organizations because of BIM – MASSOB’s stand on non- violence methodology. No country will like to do business or deal with terrorists,” he added.
