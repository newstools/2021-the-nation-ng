A statement by his aide, Julius Bokoru, said Sylva described the projects as interventionist, saying they were strategically designed to create jobs in the state. The former Governor underscored the needs for all to work together to make Bayelsa a peaceful and investment-friendly destination. The Minister also assured that action would be taken on the Nembe-Brass road and harped on the need for peaceful co-existence among the people of the state.
