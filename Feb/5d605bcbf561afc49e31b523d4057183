A team of policemen, hunters, youths and vigilante groups has stormed the forests of Yewa in Ogun State in search of killer herdsmen. The search was in response to the killing on Thursday of two persons. Suspected herders struck Owode-Ketu community in Yewa North Local Government Area of the state in a predawn attack. The victims were identified as Isiaka Apesin and Oguntosin Adebayo by members of the community who  found their remains in the bush. A youth leader in Owode-Ketu town, Sina Olaleye, said one of them was shot in the chest. The Baale of the town, Rev Sanya Fabuyi, lamented that Owode-Ketu has been under sustained attack by herders. He said the community heard that the attackers who were traced to the bush, wore bulletproof vests and armed with sophisticated weapons. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi told The Nation that there was a manhunt for the killers. On its part, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in the state has directed its member to fish out herders unleashing terror on the people of the state. Abache said doing so will protect the integrity of herders doing legitimate business in Ekiti and change people’s perception that all Fulani herdsmen are criminals. Abache spoke in Ado Ekiti on Thursday, during a security meeting organised by the state chapter of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) for all ethnic nationalities in the state. Speaking at the event where participants brainstormed how to ensure peaceful coexistence among ethnic groups, Abache said MACBAN had banned the use of underage for cattle herding in the state.
