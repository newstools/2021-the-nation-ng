The President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, has faulted claim the ongoing process of appointing Justices for her court was being manipulated to favour certain individuals. Justice Dongban-Mensem, in a statement on Sunday, said the current exercise passed through the due and usual process of appointment into the Judiciary. She said those behind the false claim are interested in distabilising and scandalising the Judiciary. She urged all well-meaning Nigerians to disregard such false claim. The statement reads: “I am compelled to denounce and dispel the campaign of calumny which has been going on for some weeks now about the proposed appointment of Justices to the Court of Appeal. “First and foremost, appointments to the court are not by way of replacement of those elevated to the Supreme Court nor those who have died. “Let it be known also that the current exercise passed through the due and usual process of appointment into the Judiciary. “A total of 80 nominees were shortlisted and recommended for the appointment of 20 Justices to fill the existing vacancies. “I state on my honour that any of the 80 nominees could be appointed. “It is unfortunate that some people have elected to go to the press without hard facts which are readily available to those who seek to know. “I hereby state that the current recommendation pending determination by the National Judicial Council (NJC) was done without any preference for tribe, creed or association. “If there were sufficient vacancies to be filled, all the nominees would have been recommended. “I hereby totally disassociate myself from those who are insinuating that I had a list of preferred candidates based on tribe or religion. “This is clearly the hand work of detractors who want to destabilize and scandalize the Judiciary. “We most certainly can do without these unnecessary distractions in this nation. “I urge all well-meaning Nigerians to ignore these assertions.”
