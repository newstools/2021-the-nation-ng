A first-year student of Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO), Imo State has apparently killed himself. The body of Daniel Uchenna Nwafor of the Department of Chemistry was found on Tuesday dangling on a rope in his lodge at Umuchima in the Ihiagwa area of Owerri, the state capital. Sources said that the 18-year-old recently returned to the lodge with his mother, who stayed with him for some days before leaving. Two days after her departure, Nwafor killed himself, it was said. Nwafor was said to be unwell and in pain. The Nation learnt that he left a note for his mother, a document which the police have recovered as exhibit. FUTO spokesperson Uche Nwaelue confirmed the incident, wondering why the teenager would kill himself. “Somebody brought the picture to me though I have not visited the scene but I wonder why an 18-year-old person would take his life,” she said. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu said Nwafor’s body has been taken to the mortuary. “I can confirm the report to be true,” he said. “It happened and the body has been taken to the mortuary.”
