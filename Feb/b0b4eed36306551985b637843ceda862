Residents of Akodo community in Ibeju-Lekki area of Lagos State have denied knowledge of the alleged recovery of a body from the lagoon by policemen. The Baale of Akodo, Chief Adebayo Ogunlaja told The Nation that police stormed their community and randomly rounded up residents following a newspaper report that a 40-year-old-man, Wale Kalejaiye, was abducted from policemen in the Akodo and recovered on a beach in the area. Chief Ogunlaja said, “When a team of detectives from MOPOL 20 and 49 both of the Akodo Division visited Akodo and told us that a body had been recovered from the lagoon, it was a rude shock to us. We told them we didn’t know anything about it. But to our greatest dismay, the Police Mobile Force said they had names of certain people from the community on their wanted listed.” The community scribe Idris Akeem said some policemen claiming to be operatives of the IGP Monitoring Unit came to their community and “started arresting people at random. They arrested Alhaji Bariwu Oluwo, Ayomikun Ogunlaja, son of the Baale, who came on a visit, Agbaje Tajudeen and Bikonse Olusegun and moved them to Force Headquarters, Abuja.  We’re a peace-loving and law-abiding community.” When contacted, the state police spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi referred our correspondent to the Force Spokesman Frank Mba, but calls to Mba rang out while a text message sent to his mobile phone had yet to be responded to at press time.
