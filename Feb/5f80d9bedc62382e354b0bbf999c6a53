Nigerian Afro-Versa musician, Taiwo Hassan Aderinoye, popularly known as “Snoweezy”, said he gets inspiration for his music “spiritually”. Snoweezy who recently released his debut EP titled IMPERFECTION three months ago claimed that two of his tracks; Dreams Turn Reality and Sombodi, “were inspired by the struggle Nigerian young up and coming artistes face before they get the actual attention needed.” “I am inspired by all African artists doing their best for themselves and taking African music to the world,” he says. Speaking about his debut EP, the Federal Polytechnic Ilaro alumni said; “It’s gaining massive streams online and airplay. I am currently working on shooting videos for some of the songs on the EP. “I just released the visuals to Dreams Turn Reality which I featured Otega and it’s available on my Youtube channel (Snoweezy). “We shot my scenes at a rough area in Ojuelegba, Lagos state while the scenes of Otega and I were shot at Lagos Island”. Snoweezy claimed he was unable to feature big names like 9ice because of the price charged by the agency trying to connect them featured artistes like Bella Shmurda (for SOMBODI) and Otega (for Dreams Come Reality) in the EP. According to him, he will like to work with Mayorkun before the end of the year, “because currently in Nigeria any song Mayorkun jumps on is a hit. “If I am opportune to feature an international artiste, that would be Justin Bieber.” Talking about what keeps him going, he said; “my fans are the best thing that happened to my career. Without them, there will never be anybody known as Snoweezy. “I call them the SnowForce. When you have honest and genuine fans, you have it all.”
