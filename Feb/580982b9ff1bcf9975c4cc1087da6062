The Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry and restitution for victims of SARS and the Lekki Tollgate incident at the weekend heard how a man was beaten to death by policemen attached to Okokomaiko Division. The deceased, Julius Adeogun, a lotto operator, was allegedly killed in 2018 by cops who arrested him during a raid. In her evidence before the panel, the deceased’s widow, Mrs. Adewunmi Adeogun alleged that her husband was apprehended on January 31, 2018 during a raid on their street. The woman who wept uncontrollably said he was arrested alongside many other people but unfortunately, he never came back. “Unlike others who were allegedly released after allegedly paying the bail fee, my husband was not that lucky as he was beaten to death,” she stated. According to the woman, her late husband was the one taking care of his aged parents, their four children and herself. However, hearing could not continue on her matter as a result of her emotional state. The panel in its wisdom held that the woman was unfit for cross-examination by the police counsel and adjourned the matter to March 9 for further hearing. Prior to this case, the panel heard five other petitions including that of Adebayo Yinka Austin vs Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS), which involved an alleged wrongful arrest, detention.
