 Organised Labour, operating in the telecommunications sector, has issued a 14-day ultimatum to telecom giant, Huawei Technologies Nigeria Limited, to address all the labour-related issues confronting the workers in the company or face a total shutdown of its operations in the country. The union, Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN), an affiliate of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), at a media briefing in Lagos, yesterday, warned that the proposed action would be damning as it would affect all major telecommunications service providers in the country whose infrastructure, Huawei supported. The General Secretary of the union, Okonu Abdullahi, said all the union’s efforts in the past three years to address all the labour related issues confronting the workers in the company, including reporting to the Ministry of Labour and Employment, have been rebuffed by its management. “We implored business partners, individuals, and corporate organisations, especially all the telecoms operators that rely on Huawei Technologies Limited, to either impress it on the company to change its way towards the union and its members in the organisation by yielding to our demands or source for another alternative to satisfy their business interests as our proposed action will be wide and compelling with deep implications for their business.” Efforts to get the company’s reaction however proved abortive as neither the Deputy Managing Director nor the Human Resources Manager picked their calls.
