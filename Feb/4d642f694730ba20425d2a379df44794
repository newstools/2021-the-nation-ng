Four top traditional rulers from the Southwest states have arrived at the Oyo State Government Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan ahead of a security meeting scheduled for Saturday. Aside from the traditional rulers, four other state governors have also joined the Oyo state governor. The guests are part of enlarged stakeholders to participate at the security, meeting to be hosted by Governor Seyi Makinde, at the Executive Chamber of the Governors office. The meeting is to be attended by the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Gambari. The four traditional rulers that have arrived as at the time of filing, this report includes, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi; Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi; Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji; Akarigbo of Remo, Oba Babatunde Ajayi and the Olugbo of Ugboland, Oba Fredrick Akinruntan.

The meeting will also have in attendance other governors from the Southwest states as well as the members of the Oyo State Council of Obas. Unconfirmed sources hinted that the IGP and DG DSS are expected to make an on-the-spot assessment of the Shasha scene, Akinyele local government where a recent crisis broke out. Recall that four northern governors last week visited Governor Makinde in a bid to tame the crisis that almost turned tribal.
