Pep Guardiola says he did not inspire Mikel Arteta and lauded his former Manchester City No 2 for the job he is doing as Arsenal manager, feeling that the Gunners will be future Premier League title contenders. Arsenal have not won the league since 2004 while City have won three of the last seven, and look likely to land the 2021 title after opening up a 10-point gap at the top of the Premier League after their 3-1 win at Everton on Wednesday. That was their 17th straight win in all competitions while the Gunners, who won last season’s FA Cup under Arteta, have picked up only one victory in their last five following their 1-1 Europa League draw with Benfica. Speaking ahead of City’s trip to the Emirates on Sunday – live on Sky Sports Premier League – Guardiola heaped praise on his former assistant and felt that Arsenal could once again start challenging for titles in the “early future” under Arteta. “I did not inspire him [Mikel Arteta]. What he knows he knows for himself,” Guardiola said on Friday. “I am not any influence. What he is doing, all credit to him and his backroom staff. Tomorrow we will have an incredible performance. They have an exceptional build-up, they have quality and they have energy.”
