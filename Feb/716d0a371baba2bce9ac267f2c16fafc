A former Chairman, Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, yesterday told the Federal High Court, Abuja, that his leg might be amputated if he was not granted bail to have adequate medical care. Mainaâ€™s counsel, Sani Katu (SAN), told Justice Okon Abang at the resumed trial that he had to be taken to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, following his worsening health condition. The medical report was attached to the bail application. The lawyer, who said that Kuje Correctional Centre where Maina was kept did not have facility to attend to his state of health, said if not granted bail, his leg might be amputated. Maina had on January 20 approached Justice Abang for another bail after his arrest for jumping the first bail. Maina, in a motion on notice dated and filed on December 24, 2020, brought by one of his lawyers, Anayo Adibe, said the application became necessary because of his worsening health condition. In the motion, the ex-pension boss told the court that he had reasonable and responsible people who were willing to act as sureties if granted bail.
