 After his slow introduction to the starting line-up, Coach Gennaro Gattuso has said that Victor Osimhen has been an added value to Napoli since the Nigerian joined the Serie A side from Lille on a record transfer. Since returning from injury, Osimhen has come up the bench twice for Napoli while he replaced Hirving Lozano in the 82nd minutes of Napoli’s goalless draw against Atalanta in the first leg of Copa Italia. Speaking in a post-match press conference, Gattuso said the return of Osimhen to the starting line-up would be gradual. “We have to wait for him, making him (Osimhen) stay two games in a row on the bench could have been a blow,” he said. “Today( Wednesday),  I saw him a little more active, you have to give him time but you need people ready to fight.“ He added: “Osimhen is an added value for us, as is Mertens and we have to wait for him. We have only one striker available. Petagna did not play from the first minute also for this reason, because he is our only striker available: you have to manage him well because losing him would be a problem.” There are indications that Gattuso may throw Osimhen into the fray in the second leg of the Copa Italian against Atalanta next Wednesday. On his possible exit from the club, the former Italian international said: “I’m not going back to what I said, it wasn’t complicated. I have a duty to be a professional. There was an outburst and that’s it, that’s it.
