A police inspector attached to the Owerri Area command police headquarters, simply identified as Umoh, has shot and killed himself. The incident happened on Wednesday in Owerri, the state capital. A source at the Area command headquarters told our correspondent that the officer shot himself in a room in the quarters. The development, our correspondent learnt, caused panic in the area. According to the source, the inspector was on a special duty in the area. The source said that though the riot policeman complained of being ill, nobody envisaged he was going to take his life. The source said, “Mobile officers came back and one of them went to one of the rooms and locked it. The next minute, we heard a gunshot. When we approached the quarters, it was discovered that the door was locked. It was forced open and the mobile policeman was found dead. He shot himself in his stomach.” Spokesperson Orlando Ikeokwu confirmed the incident.
