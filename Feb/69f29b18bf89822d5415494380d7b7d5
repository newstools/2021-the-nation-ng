  D’Tigers’ Ike Diogu and D’Tigress’ Evelyn Akhator are not bothered about the quality of oppositions both the men’s and women’s national basketball teams would face at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Already, D’Tigers have been drawn in Group B alongside Australia while winners from the qualifiers in Croatia and Serbia will join the group. D’Tigress have also been pitched against USA, France and host Japan in Group B of the women’s event. Speaking with FIBA.basketball, Diogu cannot hide the excitement to face the best teams in the world once again along with D’Tigers. “It’s just like the World Cup,” the two-time Olympian told FIBA.basketball. “I don’t think there are any easy draws, every team we are going to play, it’s going to be really good. These are the 12 best teams in the world. We’re looking forward to the challenge. “Our first opponent is going to be Australia, which is a top-five team in the world. We’re looking forward to seeing who the next two opponents are going to be as well,” said the 37-year-old power forward. Diogu currently holds a Nigerian record for most points (134) and rebounds (88) recorded in the history of the Olympics. “We are really happy to be in the Olympics and we are happy with whatever draw we have,” said the FIBA AfroBasket 2017 Most Valuable Player. “We feel really good about our group. This should be the best group that Nigeria has had, and whoever we play against we are going to be excited.” Meanwhile, Akhator told NationSport yesterday that the D’Tigress would be at the ready in Japan. “It’s pretty tough group, however, we just have to go out there and do our best; making sure we don’t leave any stone unturned.”
