President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the family of the pioneer Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Chief Festus Marinho, who passed on recently at the age of 87 years. In a letter to the Marinho family, the President described the deceased as a “skilled and knowledgeable person,” whom he worked with twice in his days as Petroleum Minister. Quoting the President’s condolence letter in a statement in Tuesday, his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Mr. Femi Adesina catalogued the stint of the late Marinho in the oil and gas industry. “I write to express my heartfelt condolence on the passage of a noted Oil and Gas Executive, Chief Festus Marinho, whom I worked within the industry for many years. “Chief Marinho was Managing Director of Nigerian National Oil Corporation (NNOC), which was the forerunner of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). He became the pioneer Group Managing Director of NNPC, where he proved his mettle as a skilled and knowledgeable person. No wonder he served twice, 1977-1979, and 1984-1985. “As Minister for Petroleum for over three years, I served closely with the late Marinho. He was brought back under my time as military head of state. I found him resourceful and hard working. “I pray that God rests his soul, and comfort the family he left behind,” the President said.
