 Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has praised President Muhammadu Buhari for approving of the establishment of the Federal Polytechnic Shendam, describing it as cheering news for indigenes of the state and a catalyst for the development. Lalong spoke when he received a letter from the Federal Ministry of Education conveying the approval of President Buhari for the establishment of the polytechnic. He said the gesture shows the love that the President has for Plateau State and its technological development and that of the nation at large. “The establishment of Federal Polytechnic Shendam comes at a time when we are redefining education in Plateau State and focusing on technical education to give our youths skills that can help them use their talents to create jobs and solve day-to-day problems of the society. “We are excited that this new institution will connect seamlessly with the new technical schools we are building in Pankshin, Shendam and the upgrade of the Technical School in Bukuru, all meant to move our students away from education that leaves them stranded after graduation,” he said. Lalong also lauded the approval of N2 Billion naira through the TETFund for the provision of core facilities towards the take-off of the school within the shortest possible time. He promised that his government would give all necessary support to the institution, assuring the host community would also be mobilised for support and collaboration.
