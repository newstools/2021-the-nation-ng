Most analysts expected the equities market to remain tepid as investors weigh the direction of yields at the fixed-income market and the audited results of quoted companies. “We expect the equities market rally witnessed in January to mellow in the months of February and March, despite the anticipated dividend payment announcements by corporates in the months, as share prices have risen to levels where the dividend yields appear to have been stretched. This is more so as the fixed income yields are beginning to rise,” Cowry Asset Management Limited stated. According to analysts, the equities market may further trade southwards as risk-averse investors stay on the sidelines in anticipation of the audited full year results for last year and the announcements of their dividend payments. Afrinvest Securities stated that trading would be a mix of bargain hunting and sustained profit-taking. “The direction of yields in the fixed income market would also influence trades especially given the increase in marginal rates at the OMO auction this week,” Afrinvest Securities stated at the weeknd. Analysts at Cordros Securities however said with the moderation in the prices last week, savvy investors may take advantage of the low prices and make re-entry ahead of the announcement of full-year 2020 results. Analysts also cautioned that the recent hike in OMO rates by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will continue to stoke uncertainties on the direction of yields, keeping risk-averse investors on the side-lines. “Thus, we expect a zig-zag market performance in the week ahead.  Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated.
