In line to eradicate poverty in Ogun State, Igbalaye Ayodele Foundation (IAF) has empowered nothing less than 100 people in Ogun State as part of his contribution to boost the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the State. IAF was founded by the Former Labour Party candidate in the last election who is also the Registrar of ESTG University, Hon Igbalaye Ayodele Wasiu, popularly Known as (IWA). In a press release, made available to journalists by his media adviser, Adeyemi Obadimu said SMEs play a major role in most economies, particularly in developing countries; they also contribute to job creation and global economic development and that is why he came up with the idea of empowering barbers and those who are into SMEs in Abeokuta South. Ayodele who was represented by IAF Chairman, Kabiru Olajide, explained the reason behind the massive empowerment. ‘It is not the time to play politics but to give back to the needy in the local government and we are giving 50 barbers and 50 people who are into SMEs. Items given to the barbers are clippers, after-shave, combs, brushes, etc and 10 thousand naira each was given to 50 people to support their businesses.’ Kabiru Olajide urged beneficiaries to make use of what they were given wisely.
