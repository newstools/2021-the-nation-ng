Yoruba rights activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, has asked for forgiveness from the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi for alleging the monarch failed the Yoruba nation during his recent visit to President Muhammadu Buhari. Igboho, in virtual meeting tagged: Townhall with Yoruba in Diaspora, said the Ooni disappointed the Yoruba people for not telling Buhari the truth about herdsmen killings in the South West when they met. But in a viral video on Wednesday evening obtained by The Nation, Sunday Igboho said he had spoken with the monarch on phone and begged him for forgiveness. Igboho, who denied insulting the monarch, said: “I did not insult the Ooni. “I have called our father, the Ooni of Ife and I have apologised to him. When I said those things, I was carried away by my emotions. “The killing of my people by Fulani herdsmen and the way our fathers in Yoruba land are handling the issue is giving me great concerns. “I am a Yoruba man and I know it is not in our culture to insult the elders. I have called the Kabiyesi and I have apologised to him. You can call him to confirm. “Once again, I want to beg our royal father to forgive me. It was a slip of tongue, “But because I was pained by the issue, my tongue was caught up in the moment. I spoke according to how pained I was. It wasn’t the Ooni alone I directed my words at, I also did to other elders. “It’s a case of father and child. I and the monarch have spoken as well as the Olugbon. I did not insult Ooni. And if it appears as if I did, he should forgive me.”
