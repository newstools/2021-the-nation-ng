The Rivers State House of Assembly has passed into law a bill to enforce the use of facemask in public places. The bill was brought by the Chairman, House Committee on Health, Sam Ogeh, who is also the member representing Emohua Constituency. The Speaker, Ikwuinyi Owaji-Ibani, said: “The coming of coronavirus into the world in the first quarter of 2020 has changed the narrative and the equation of the World. “A new enemy introduced into the world has altered all that had been here before it came; that is why as human beings, we must be able to acknowledge and recognise the difference with yesterday before the coming of Coronavirus and pandemic.  “When you take life for granted, life itself will also take you for granted.” He regretted that the citizens are not cooperating with the government in the efforts to help and protect them from the deadly effects of the pandemic. “As we know that the first fundamental duty of governments is to protect life and property, if government has directed in the interest of all that we should wear face masks, wash our hands, these are the basic minimum that anyone can do to ensure basic hygiene. We must do these to help government.” Lawmakers, who contributed to the debate, spoke in favour of the motion.
