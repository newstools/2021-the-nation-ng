An Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan yesterday ordered the Alajaawa of Ajaawa in Ogo-Oluwa Local Government, Oba Thompson Oyetunji, to vacate his stool and stop parading himself as the monarch of the town. It also ordered the Governor and the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters to withdraw the certificate and staff of office given to Oyetunji, saying it was done in flagrant disobedience to the court order made on March 11, 2020. The presiding judge, Justice Sherifat Adeyemi, nullified the appointment and approval and presentation of certificate for installation and staff of office for Oba Oyetunji by the governor, saying evidence had shown that it was done against the court order during the pendency of the suit until final determination of the case.
