The Nigeria Police has stated the three- month extension of tenure of the Inspector General of Police (I-G), Mohammed Adamu, is strictly the prerogative of the President. The Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), Mr Frank Mba, disclosed this in a statement on Monday in Abuja. He said the clarification followed reports in some sections of the media on Feb. 7, that the I-G paid over N2 billion to secure the tenure extension. Mba described the report as untrue, unfounded, defamatory and libelous, adding that the tenure extension was never paid for as maliciously reported in the publication. According to him, the insinuations in the report that the I-G did not celebrate his extension smacks ignorance and a pathetic misplacement of priority. He said that the extension was not for merrymaking or celebration but a time for more work, rededication to duty and selfless service to the nation. Mba pledged the commitment of the Police under the leadership of the I-G to improve service delivery, safety and security of the citizenry. He enjoined the public to disregard and discountenance the publication as it was evidently untrue and unfounded. Mba said the I-G would remain undistracted with the Force, motivated and committed to delivering on its mandate, especially the task of neutralising current and emerging internal security threats. He said the I-G had directed his team of lawyers to commence legal action against the publishers. (NAN)
