 The father-son relationship between Victor Osimhen and coach Gennaro Gattuso at Napoli may be coming to an end with confirmation that the former Milan coach would leave his post in June. Napoli and Gattuso are reportedly destined to part ways this summer. Sky Sport Italia reports that the recent rumours regarding the former Milan coach’s position at the Partenopei and the very openly manifested ‘disappointment’ will lead to a split in June. Gattuso picked up the Coppa Italia last season but has struggled to keep up with League leaders Milan in Serie A. With Napoli currently fifth in the League and with a nine-point gap up to the top, pressure increased for Gattuso. Reports of contact between President Aurelio De Laurentiis and former coach Rafael Benitez, recently freed from his contractual ties with Dalian, sparked rumours of an early departure for Gattuso this winter. After the 2-0 win against Parma last night, Gattuso manifested his disappointment with De Laurentiis and highlighted that he has ‘correctly’ rejected any proposals coming his way. Sky Sport Italia claims the current icy front between the two will not thaw anytime soon and reports that Gattuso will leave Napoli after the current campaign.
