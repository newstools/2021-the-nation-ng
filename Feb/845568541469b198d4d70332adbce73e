Having shaken off hamstring complaints, Isaac Success and Stipe Perica are back training with Watford’s first-team squad, in a boost to the options of Hornets’ Head Coach Xisco Muñoz. Success was linked with a deadline day move to Huddersfield Town and Derby County a few days ago. Success is yet to make an appearance for Watford this season and it looks like the Hornets are ready to offload him if a suitable bid is made. Full-backs Adam Masina and Kiko Femenía, both of whom missed Monday night’s fixture at Vicarage Road with minor knocks, will be assessed closer to Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off at Coventry City. New arrival Dan Gosling is building his fitness levels, having not featured for Bournemouth in recent weeks, so will be closely monitored and is unlikely to play a part this weekend. The bone bruising to Christian Kabasele’s knee will keep the centre-half out for at least two more weeks as he continues gym-based training, while goalkeeper Ben Foster remains sidelined with a finger injury. Tom Dele-Bashiru’s rehabilitation from an October ACL injury also continues.
