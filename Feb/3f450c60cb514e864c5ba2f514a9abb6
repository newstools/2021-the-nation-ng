Fulham’s new goal-scoring hero Josh Maja admits getting off the mark early in his Cottagers’ career is a weight off his shoulders. The 22-year-old scored twice on his full debut for the club following his deadline-day loan move from Bordeaux to secure a 2-0 win at Everton which ended a run of 12 matches without victory. It moved third-bottom Fulham to within seven points of safety ahead of a crucial week crucial to their survival hopes with matches against Burnley and bottom side Sheffield United. Maja’s goals, both poacher’s efforts from close range, were his first since October 17 in a 3-1 defeat to Marseille in Ligue 1. However, it took him less than 60 minutes’ playing time for his new club to find the net. “It’s a great day. I’m happy and the team is happy and hopefully we can continue,” Maja told FFC TV. “It’s been a while since I started a game so I was happy to get that and I’m hoping to continue performances like this. “It is a weight off my shoulders. I felt coming in I would get opportunities and I was glad to take them.” Maja first came to prominence as a youth team prospect promoted to the first team in the Netflix documentary Sunderland ‘Til I Die, which first aired a couple of years ago. His move from League One to Ligue 1 saw him score 11 goals in 46 appearances for Bordeaux, helping him win one cap for Nigeria in 2019, but it meant the burgeoning talent which was first showcased on the small screen for thousands of households who would not normally see a Sunderland game has largely gone unnoticed. “They (the fans) got a glimpse of it but I feel like I have more to show,” he added. “The performance is important and I want to give my best to the team, not just goals. “It gives us big confidence. We know we need to keep picking up wins, we have been drawing and losing a few the last few games, and we are hoping to go into the next few games confident we can win.”
