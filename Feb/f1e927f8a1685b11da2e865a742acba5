Police operatives have arrested no fewer than 10 protesters at the Lekki toll gate on Saturday. One of the coordinators of #OccupyLekkiTollgate, Kunle Ajayi, confirmed this to The Nation. He said: “Police have just arrested 10 protesters – Four ladies and six guys. They were beaten mercilessly and injured,” he said.  In a video, one of the arrested protesters said: “We have been arrested. Over 10 of us. We are kept in a black maria stationed at the toll gate now.” The Federal Government and the police had warned youths who planned to protest at the Lekki tollgate on Saturday to shelve the idea.  But the young Nigerians, under the aegis of #EndSARS Season 2 and #OccupyLekkiTollgate, vowed to defy the government’s order. The other group, #DefendLagos withdrew from the protest, noting that it was in accordance with the government’s directives that no protest should hold. The #EndSARS Season 2 and #OccupyLekkiTollgate said their action was informed by the decision of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry allowing the Lekki Concession Company to reopen the Lekki tollgate.
