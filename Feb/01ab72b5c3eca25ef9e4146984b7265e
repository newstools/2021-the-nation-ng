The Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, has urged access to all, including members of the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the ongoing APC party’s membership registration exercise. Omo-Agege, who spoke in Orogun, Ughelli North LGA, Delta State, said the essence of the exercise is to rejuvenate the party. His words, “Our overall leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, wants all party faithful to grow the APC from the bottom up. “To my leaders, this exercise is going to be different. Everybody and anybody desirous to be registered should not be denied, including PDP members, especially the aggrieved ones. Let’s reach out to them. “The exercise should not be factionalised. We won’t entertain reports from people that they are shut out from joining the party. When the APC is firmly on the ground in every unit, then we can ensure victory for the party in all elections from bottom up.”
