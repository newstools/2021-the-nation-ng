The new Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, has promised to fish out and punish Navy personnel who collude with drug traffickers, kidnapers, armed robbers and other criminals to undermine national security. Gambo, who unveiled his mission statement on Tuesday during his maiden meeting with Principal Staff Officers, Flag Officers Commanding and Commanders of Autonomous Units of the Nigerian Navy at Naval Headquarters in Abuja, promised to strenghten established policies and measures to sanction identified economic saboteurs in the service. Immediate former Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibot Ekwe-Ibas, had severally warned about the existence of subversive elements among the naval personnel. Also, Gambo said his vision is “to leverage on all factors of national location, technology, training, teamwork and synergy to re-energise the Nigerian Navy and enhance her as a well-motivated and ready Naval Force in the discharge of her constitutional mandate and other assigned tasks in fulfillment of national security objectives”. The new CNS promised that to achieve this vision, his administration would focus on some key drivers. He added: “The current administration would ensure personnel welfare is accorded high priority towards enhanced patriotism, integrity, productivity, innovation, commitment and dedication.” Also, immediate past Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshall Sadique Abubakar, has said he left the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fulfilled, having met all his set objectives for the Service. Abubakar, who spoke during his fly out parade at the NAF Base in Abuja, said in the last five years, the NAF was repositioned and restructured into a highly “professional and disciplined force”.
