Sule spoke at the palace of the Sarkin Loko, Alhaji Umar on Monday. The governor said the security agents would be stationed between Ajaga, Bakono and Loko and Tunga town. “The Federal Government is quick in sending a unit of mobile police that will be stationed in the area in the next one week. We want to show great appreciation to that,” he said. The governor urged the people of Loko Development Area to cooperate with the security agents. He also appealed to communities in the area not to shield bandits. He warned the bandits to leave the area.
