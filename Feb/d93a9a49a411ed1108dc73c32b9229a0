All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain Senator Tokunbo Abiru has financially-supported 1,000 vulnerable people in Lagos East Senatorial District. The gesture was in fulfilment of his promise to alleviate the suffering of the indigent people, who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The beneficiaries, who include widows, the physically-challenged, the aged, women and unemployed youths, were drawn from 98 wards across 16 local governments in the district. The support scheme, which is scheduled into two categories, will run throughout this year. Beneficiaries will get the assistance bi-monthly through direct credit to their bank accounts. Abiru said in a statement in Lagos: “As the representative of the people, I know how many of our constituents, especially the vulnerable, were and are still adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. “This modest effort in ameliorating the plight of our people is one in the series of other interventions geared towards making life easier for the poor. “After the pilot set numbering about 1,000, the second category will be scaled to 1,200 and we hope to capture more people in future.”
