The Director-General of the Progressive Governor’s Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh Lukman, has said the rejection of former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, by members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from defecting to the party, despite meeting with the party leadership, is an attestation of the strong internal democratic culture of the party. In a statement titled “APC, and the Question of Values” in Abuja on Friday, Lukman said the fact that members were able to reject Fani-Kayode’s attempt to join the party meant the APC has values. He said, “The issue of Mr. Fani-Kayode’s drifted attempt to join the APC is a clear instance of attempts to manipulate some of our leaders into accepting membership of someone who ought not to have been considered a member of our party. If that was the case in the past, it is better late than never to correct such a mistake. “As party members, we were able to rise up to the challenge of engaging our leaders. Fortunately, we are able to gain the respect of our leaders and surely, moving forward, issues of who qualifies to be a member of our party will be clarified unambiguously. Maybe this could challenge the PDP and other parties in Nigeria to begin to address issues related to their failings,” he said.
