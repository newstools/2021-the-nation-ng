Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has approved the appointment of Mr. Gbolahan Oki as the General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LABSCA) and Adenike Dasola Oyetunde as the Senior Special Assistant to Mr. Governor on Persons Living with Disabilities (PLWD). Oyetunde’s appointment was in fulfilment of Governor Sanwo-Olu’s promise last December to appoint a Senior Special Assistant, during an interactive session and distribution of support items to 364 physically-challenged persons at the State House, Marina. A statement by Head of Service Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola said Oki’s appointment was consequent upon the appointment and redeployment of the erstwhile General Manager of the agency, Mrs. Abiola Kosegbe, as the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. He said before his current appointment, Oki, a highly experienced professional, was the Lagos State Chief Resilience Officer, adding that the new General Manager also served at the Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency from 2000 to 2012, among other state agencies. Noting that the appointee made significant contributions and distinguished himself in the positions he had held, Muri-Okunola said his appointment as GM, LASBCA is with immediate effect. He said the appointment of Oyetunde stems from the confidence in her capabilities and demonstrated commitment to the right and well-being of PLWD.
