Six hours after an AZMAN Air Boeing 737-500 experienced a burst tyre on landing at the Runway 18R/36L of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has reopened the runway for normal flights. The re-opening of the runway for flights was sequel to the removal of the aircraft, which blocked the runway after the landing incident. Regional Manager, South West FAAN, Mrs. Victoria Shin Aba, confirmed this to The Nation on phone. She said normal flights resumed at the airport in the wee hours of Wednesday February 17, 2021. An AZMAN Air aircraft had on Tuesday blocked the 18R/36L runway of the Lagos Airport after it had a burst tyre on landing.

Aba said: ” The AZMAN Air has since midnight on Tuesday been removed from the runway. Normal flights have resumed. International flights have since resumed.”
