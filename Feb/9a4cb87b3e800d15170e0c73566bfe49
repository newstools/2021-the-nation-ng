Nigerian equities have lost N216 billion in three successive negative trading sessions as early corporate earnings showed mixed performance. Also, the naira weakened further on Wednesday, dropping by 0.1 per cent to N395.50 per dollar at the official Investors & Exporters ( I&E) window. It however remained flat at N480 per dollar at the parallel market. Benchmark indices at the Nigerian stock market showed increased profit-taking activities so far in February, after equities closed January with net capital gain of N1.13 trillion. Nigerian equities had posted average return of 50.03 per cent in 2020, the highest return within tracked global markets. The All Share Index (ASI) – a value-based common index that tracks all share prices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), closed yesterday at 42,000.01 points as against this week’s opening index of 42,412.66 per cent, representing a decline of 0.97 per cent. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NSE also dropped from the month’s opening value of N22.187 trillion to close on Wednesday at N21.971 trillion, representing a net capital depreciation of N216 billion or 0.97 per cent. The concurrence between the ASI and market value underscored that the decline in value was due to share price depreciation that resulted from ordinary trading, rather than reduction due to delisting or share reconstruction. Market analysts said the negative overall market situation was mainly due to profit-taking transactions by investors seeking to lock in capital gains as well as portfolio realignments across the sectors as investors weigh prospective earnings and returns. “We believe the expectations of and trend in corporate releases will influence performance this week,” Afrinvest Securities stated. With average return of 5.32 per cent in January 2021, equivalent to net capital gains of N1.13 trillion, the performance of Nigerian stocks ranked seventh in the world, according to Bloomberg World Equities Index. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NSE had in January risen from 2021’s opening value of N21.057 trillion to close the month at N22.187 trillion. The ASI- which doubles as Nigeria’s sovereign equities index, had also risen from 2021’s opening index of 40,270.72 points to close January at 42,412.66 points. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession, Nigerian equities had played the full contrarian to close 2020 with net capital gain of N6.48 trillion. The average full-year return of 50.03 per cent in 2020 led the global equities return table and was the highest by the Nigerian market in recent period. The previous recent highest return was 42.3 per cent recorded in 2017. The ASI closed 2020 at 40,270.72 points, 50.03 per cent above 26,842.07 points recorded as opening index for the year. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NSE rose to N21.057 trillion by the end of 2020 as against N12.958 trillion recorded as opening value for the year, an increase of N8.1 trillion. The additional increase in value of market capitalisation, above the ASI percentage change, was due to additional or supplementary listing of shares during the year. The recovery at the Nigerian stock market since 2020 has been particularly spectacular when viewed against the background of negative performance in recent years. After posting a world-ranking return of 42.3 per cent in 2017, the market had reversed to negative in 2018 with average full-year return of -17.81 per cent. In 2019, investors suffered net loss of about N1.71 trillion with negative average return of -14.60 per cent. Prior to 2017, the stock market had been on a losing streak since 2014. Investors lost N1.75 trillion in 2014 and followed this with another loss of N1.63 trillion in 2015. Against the general expectation that political transition and new government will quicken a rebound, equities closed 2016 with a net capital loss of N604 billion.
