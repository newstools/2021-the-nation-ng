A Mobile Court has sentenced a fake soldier arrested by operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Taskforce) for assault and impersonation to six weeks imprisonment. Chairman of the Taskforce, Shola Jejeloye, a Chief Superintendent (CSP), said the convicted fake soldier was apprehended on Friday evening with his commercial motorcycle painted in camouflage after assaulting members of the agency with other miscreants at Airport Bus-stop on Lagos-Abeokuta Express-way. He said operatives of the agency were coming from a monitoring and enforcement operations with over 150 impounded motorcycles loaded into three trucks before the fake soldier, whose commercial motorcycle was among those impounded on restricted routes, mobilised other miscreants and attacked the team with stones, bottles and iron-rod. “The fake Soldier was subsequently arrested after the attack and during investigations at our office it was discovered that he was an impersonator. “The man later confessed to having only claimed to be a soldier in order to retrieve his impounded commercial motorcycle and that he painted his motorcycle with Nigerian Army camouflage to evade arrest from security agents while engaging in commercial activities on restricted routes,” Jejeloye said. He urged members of the public to stop impersonating security agents to commit crimes as anyone caught would be dealt with in accordance with the law. The chairman confirmed that the arraignment of the fake Soldier at the Lagos Mobile Court was in compliance with the directive of the Lagos State Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu. Magistrate Oyebimbola Israel Adelakun, who presided over the matter same day, sentenced the accused, Kabiru Mohammed, 25, to six weeks in jail with N40, 000 as an option of fine after he had pleaded guilty to the three-count charge of Assault, Conduct Likely to Cause Breach of Peace and Impersonation levied against him.
