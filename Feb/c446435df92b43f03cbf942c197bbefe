Two policemen were reportedly killed while several others sustained serious injuries following a renewed attack on Chachenji village in Takum local government area of Taraba state by a suspected militia group on Wednesday. A source in Chachenji, Bala Nuhu told our correspondent in a telephone interview that the suspected militia invaded the village from neibouring Benue state and allegedly launched early morning attack while armed with sophisticated weapons. He said the attackers killed two mobile policemen and wounded many people, including children women and children. According to Nuhu, the attackers on entering Chachenji village began shooting sporadically and later made their way to the police station and the palace of the 3rd class chief in the town and attempted to break into the palace but were allegedly repelled by some Youths of Chachenji. The source further said residents, including women and children fled the village towards different directions for their lives, adding that mobile police were later drafted to the village from a nearby police base to chase the attackers who fled into the neighbouring Benue State. It was gathered that shortly after the attack, Tiv tribes residing in Chachenji village have fled and crossed into Benue state with their belongings for fear of reprisal attack by Jukun Youths. Another source in Takum told our correspondent that some of the victims of the attack were taken to Takum general hospital for treatment. The Nation recalls that there has been high tension between Tiv/Jukun in Takum local government since the abduction of 26 Youths of Takum by some gunmen suspected to be Tiv militia two weeks ago. Reacting, the spokesman of the Taraba police command, ASP Reform Leha confirmed the attacks and said only one policeman was killed while four children sustained bullet wounds.
