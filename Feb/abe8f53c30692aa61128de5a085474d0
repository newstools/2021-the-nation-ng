  The management of Kano Pillars has paid players and officials of the team their five-match outstanding bonuses as a way to motivate them ahead of Monday’s Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) match day 9 encounter against Ifeanyi Ubah FC slated for Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The Chairman of the club, Surajo Shuaibu Jambul, who disclosed this while addressing the team on Sunday evening, said the State Government, under the leadership of Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje released the money to offset the wages. The Sai Masu Gida are enjoying a good run of results in the league, occupying six place on the log with 14 points. “You are being owed five-match bonuses so far in the on-going 2020/21 NPFL season and I’m here before you with your cheques and by God’s grace, tomorrow morning, you will all smile,” Jambul said. Jambul commended the State Governor, his deputy and commissioner of Sports and the entire people of Kano for the support they are giving to the team on a regular basis. The chairman then charged the players and technical crew to redouble their efforts and maintain focus for the task ahead of them. He said, the position of the club on the 20-team NPFL log is commendable but there is a need for the players to consolidate on their efforts by finishing the first stanza at the top of the log. He maintained that the management would not relent on its efforts in giving priority to the welfare of the players.
