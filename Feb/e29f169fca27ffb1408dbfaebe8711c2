Being born into a strong Christian home is not as exciting as it looks on the surface as it comes with huge responsibilities. If one does a little wrong, people are always there to castigate you. But despite the challenges that come with being the offspring of a popular man of God like Bishop David Oyedepo, his children have not failed him. It is also glaring that all his children have decided to follow the footsteps of their father. On Thursday, the pastorâ€™s second son, Isaac, turned 36 and it was an occasion to give special thanks to God for His grace and mercy upon his life. Isaac, who is resident pastor, Winners Chapel International, Maryland, USA, graduated from Oral Roberts University. He is passionate about grooming a generation of young godly leaders who will make a positive impact in the world. He was ordained by Kenneth E. Copeland alongside his elder brother David Jr. in 2007. Isaac married his beautiful wife, Ayomitide, in 2010, and the union has been blessed with four beautiful children.
