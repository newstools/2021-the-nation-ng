Hoodlums suspected to be smugglers on Tuesday attacked and wounded three operatives of the Federal Operations Unit (FOU), Zone A of the Nigeria Customs Service (NSC) and a military officer in Lagos. The officers, findings revealed, were on anti-smuggling patrol on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway before they were attacked and wounded. Spokesman Theophilus Duniya said in a statement that three Customs officers and a military officer attached to the patrol team sustained gunshot wounds. He said the operatives had intercepted six vehicles laden with smuggled rice before they were attacked by the hoodlums. He said, “Some officers of Federal Operations Unit Zone ‘A’ of Nigeria Customs Service, suffered an attack by hoodlums working with smugglers.” “At about 0600 hours of Tuesday 2nd February, 2021. Officers of the Unit, while carrying out their statutory duty of enforcing anti-smuggling laws; acted on intelligence and intercepted six vehicles laden with foreign parboiled rice at Abeokuta Express Way. “Upon the interception, some armed hoodlums working in support of smugglers swiftly mobilised themselves and attacked our officers in their bid to prevent the seizure from being taken away. However, in the crossfire that ensued, our operatives overpowered them and were able to evacuate three out of the intercepted vehicles to the warehouse.”
