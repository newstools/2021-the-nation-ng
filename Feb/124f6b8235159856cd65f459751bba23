The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, has cautioned the Yorubas to stop the drum of war against the Fulanis in the southwest. Oluwo argued “the lifestyle of many Fulanis is not worth fighting as they tend to lose nothing except their cows.” A statement personally signed by the monarch on Friday cautioned the herders to respect human dignity. He also appealed to Yorubas to consider their brothers in the northern parts of the country. “The lingering Yoruba-Fulani saga is a fragile issue that demands a witty, technical approach. No doubt, the activities such as killing, kidnapping, raping perpetrated by the bad eggs among the Fulanis are condemnable. “As a people, we must understand who to fight. I see Fulani as a section of the Hausas. And most Fulanis are not stationed in their origin. They have relocated and settled. “Their most valued item is cows. Most of their properties are movable. Is this who we want to declare war against?” “Declaring war against the Fulanis will be derogatorily translated to war against the Hausas. Fulanis are just a section of the Hausas. What will be the fate of billions of investments and properties of the Yorubas in the northern States? “If their cows could be moved, how will our innocent sons and daughters in the northern states move their investments and properties? I see Yoruba losing more should there be war. “I’m appealing to all and sundry to dignify human lives and toe the path of honour in sustaining a peaceful co-existence. War is an enemy of humanity. What war can do, peace can do better,” he added.
