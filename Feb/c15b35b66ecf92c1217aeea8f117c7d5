The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji has urged all warring factions in the on-going crisis at Shasha, Ibadan to sheathe their swords as jaw-jaw is better than war-war. The first-class monarch who bemoaned the high level of insecurity in the land in recent times made this known in Ibadan on Saturday after holding virtual meetings with relevant stakeholders, including Hausa/Fulani leaders in the ancient city. Oba Adetunji lamented that for all of us to truly belong to the nation called Nigeria, it is important for people to eschew violence and bitterness by ensuring that minor conflicts do not degenerate to unnecessary tension. According to Oba Adetunji “many of our compatriots have been living with each other for a long time. We grow up and attend schools together. People from diverse ethnic groups do inter marry and give birth to lovely children.” Olubadan stated that it came to him as a surprise that crisis could break out in Shasha culminating in large scale destruction such as burning down of properties belonging to neighbours. “Immediately the report of the crisis got to us in the palace yesterday, the Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Seyi Makinde was the first person I called and we have his promise that appropriate action would be taken as sinners would not go unpunished,” the monarch said. Oba Adetunji also urged the Governor to look into the possibility of compensating all those who have been affected by the needless crisis.
