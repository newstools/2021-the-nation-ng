The State-wide Waste and Environmental Education Foundation recently rolled out the Waste in the City initiative across Surulere Local Government Area, Coker-Aguda LCDA and Itire-Ikate LCDA as part of its environmental sustainability activities sponsored by the Coca-Cola Foundation. The President/CEO of the foundation, Amb. Obuesi Phillips, said this ahead of the foundationâ€™s 3rd town hall meeting schedule to hold on the 9th February 2021 at Itire-Ikate LCDA. He said the Waste in the City is a community engagements and sensitisation campaign. It is a plastic (PET Bottles) recovery initiative helping to unclog blocked drains and canals through the extraction of PET bottles, cans and other plastic waste, and recycling them through accredited off-takers. He noted that the initiative will deploy Recyclable Drop-off receptacles across selected communities. 100 community members will be trained in four key areas which are customer services, records management and waste management skills.
