The apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has asked the soldiers in Orlu, Imo State to vacate the area immediately. Again, the group warns the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) to stop unwarranted statements that could endanger the lives of the people. The acclaimed President General of the splinter group, Onyeachonam Onuorah, in a statement Monday in Awka, called for calm in the area, while appealing to soldiers to vacate the town. He said the continued presence of soldiers in Orlu and some other communities within Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State was overdue, adding that the people were not in a war situation According to Onuorah, “It is condemnable for Governor Hope Uzodinma to lock up people in their houses for weeks without making provisions that will cushion the effects of hunger, health challenges and other untold hardship the imposed curfew has caused in the affected communities. “We hereby caution IPOB and MASSOB to stop making unguarded statements that end up endangering the lives of Ndigbo. “We are not at war with the Nigerian Government and those instigating actions capable of degenerating the already tensed situations in the country to civil war should desist from such with immediate effect. “Why are the South East governors dying in silence? The silence of our South-East governors is no longer golden. “You cannot provide your people with security; you cannot take a decision and stand by it. “Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly Worldwide will demand for the resignation of all the South East governors since they have all resolved to die in silence. “Some are even abroad and imposing curfew from there, this madness must stop,” the splinter group said
