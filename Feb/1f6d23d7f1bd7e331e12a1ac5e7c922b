 Former Governor of Borno State and two term Senator, Ali Modu Sheriff, has unveiled his interest to contest for the chairmanship of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Sheriff, who joined the Peoples Democratic Party from the ANPP in 2014 after he fell out with his political godson, Gov. Kashim Shettima, became the Acting Chairman of the PDP before defecting back to the APC in April 2018. Sheriff, who accompanied Governor Mai Mala Buni to his village to vote for the local government elections, told reporters that he will run for the office of the National Chairman if the zoning favours him. He however categorically said he wouldn’t run if the party did not zone the position to the northeast. “The leadership of the party has not been zoned to any particular zone of the country for now. People have expressed their interests across the country. But the real thing is that whether I will run for the office or not will be determined by what the caretaker committee takes as a decision on where the leadership of the party will go. Whether it will go to another place or it will remain in our zone. “If it goes to another zone, I will not contest. But if it stays in our zone, I will contest,” Sheriff declared. He also commended the leadership qualities of Governor Buni whom he said is “leading by example”. Sheriff was also happy with the improvement of security in Borno and Yobe States, stressing that, it’s a clear sign that peace has returned to our states, Borno and Yobe. Look at the turnout at Buni Gari for the Local Government Election. This cannot happen in the past because of the activities of Boko Haram. I am highly impressed by the turnout that I saw,” Sheriff said.
