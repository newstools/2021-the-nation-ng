Gunmen on Thursday shot dead four policemen in mufti in Calabar, the Cross River State capital. The attackers took the policemen unawares, said residents of Ayan Mbat, where the attack took place. The policemen had reportedly mounted a checkpoint, with two of them positioned strategically on opposite sides of the road. Their bodies had been removed to a morgue when the reporter arrived at the scene. Police Commissioner Sikiru Akande confirmed the incident, saying, “The target of the people is to dampen our spirit. But we are resolute and are going to strike back at them.” Akande said the killers were probably cultists, adding that five suspects had been arrested, and two stolen guns recovered. The CP also said the slain policemen were probably on illegal duty. “That checkpoint is not this Command’s arrangement. If you were there you will see that they were in mufti,” he said.
