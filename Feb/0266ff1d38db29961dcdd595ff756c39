 The Lagos State Creative Industries Initiative LACI has partnered with EbonyLife Media and Del-York Creative Academy, to enhance the skills and exposure of approximately 1,500 practitioners in the State’s creative industry. The Lagos State Creative Industries Initiative (LACI) is set to empower the next generation of filmmakers following a recent launch. In 2021, EbonyLife Creative Academy will offer free, practical three-month courses for up to 480 learners, covering all aspects of filmmaking and media content production. Through its Creative Lagos programme, Del-York is scheduled to offer a hybrid of online and offline courses for approximately 1,000 students, in filmmaking, media, arts, technology, and digital marketing. LACI, a product of the Lagos State Ministry for Tourism and Art, will serve as a training platform for practitioners in the creative sector on the use of modern technology, to enhance the content and quality of Nigeria’s entertainment. According to Honorable Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf, the establishment of Lagos State Creative Industries Initiative(LACI) is a critical step towards making Lagos the main hub for Africa’s creative industries. “LACI is a continuation of Lagos State’s commitment to supporting our creative industries, as we drive towards leading Africa in this area and is recognised as a centre of excellence for filmmaking in particular. With a growing pool of practitioners with world-class skills, our creatives can build companies that provide investment and employment for our young people.”
