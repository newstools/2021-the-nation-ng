 Former Napoli and Italian international Dario Marcolin believes the partnership of Victor Osimhen and Lozano would be ideal in today’s second leg of Copa Italian Cup against Atalanta. The first leg ended goalless in Naples but Coach Gennaro Gattuso is expected throw Osimhen into the fray following team’s he poor display in recent times. Marcolin, a commentator on Canale 8, believes the inclusion of Osimhen in the starting line-up would be crucial for Napoli. “ We have to look at the match against Atalanta with great confidence, for me it will end in 2-2 and Napoli will pass,” he hinted. “Atalanta is a team that is in flames and they spend a lot of energy and offer many opportunities. It will be the ideal match for Lozano and Osimhen.” Meanwhile, the Repubblica newspaper believes Osimhen is yet to be at his best after returning to action after 77 days of absence due to injury cum COVID-19. Repubblica makes it known that the Nigerian striker could start again from the bench against Atalanta while he should start as a starter in the next Serie A match against Juventus scheduled for Saturday. Also yesterday’s edition of Corriere del Mezzogiorno writes: “Osimhen is growing, in Genoa he missed a clear goal but he seemed more lively, inside the match and above all more brilliant in terms of physical condition. Gattuso gave him more half an hour into the match and is considering whether to send him on the pitch from the first minute in Bergamo .”
