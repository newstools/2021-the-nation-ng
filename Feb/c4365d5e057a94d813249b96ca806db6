In an emotional way, the race has ended for the lovable Prince Shaka Akere Momoh, famously known as owner of Planet One Hotel in Maryland, Lagos. Following his sudden death due to COVID-19 complications, the businessmanâ€™s journey to infinity began with a soulful Service of Songs at the MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos, amid tears. The event attended by family members and selected friends was officiated by Bishop Francis C. Anunobi of the New Birth Ministry International. The first Bible reading was taken by his son, Jermaine Shaka Momoh, while his daughter, Kamalia Shaka Momoh, handled the second. While a brief biography of the deceased was being read, the widow, Mrs. Anita Shaka Momoh, was noticeably downcast. In the reading, late Momoh was described as a perfect gentleman who was passionate about the growth of others. The funeral service took place at Vaults & Gardens, Ikoyi, Lagos, the next day. And again, it was a harvest of tears as family and friends in attendance wept non-stop.
