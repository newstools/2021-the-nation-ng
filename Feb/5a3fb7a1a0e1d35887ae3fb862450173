THE management and staff of Eckleen Integrated Services Nig. Ltd have demanded an unreserved apology from Sen Smart Adeyemi over his ‘uncomplimentary ‘remarks on Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State. It could be recalled that Adeyemi had, during a plenary session on the floor of the senate, said Abia State Governor is a drunk and that the state has been and is still being governed by drunks. The demand of the construction company was contained in a statement made available to newsmen in Umuahia saying that such remarks from a sitting senator is quite unbecoming. The statement, which was signed by its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Engr. Uzoma Onuoha, condemned in strong terms the attack on the person of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu. Onuoha said, “I want to place on record that Abians all over the world have taken note of this unwarranted attack and unprovoked effrontery and are immediately demanding apologies from the said Senator Adeyemi at the Floor of the red Chambers”.
