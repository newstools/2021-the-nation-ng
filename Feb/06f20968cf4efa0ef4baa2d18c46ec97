Two glaring errors from Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson gifted Manchester City a 10th successive Premier League victory and a 10-point advantage over the reigning champions. Mohamed Salah’s penalty had cancelled out a close-range opener from Ilkay Gundogan, who had earlier blazed over from the spot, during a frenetic second half at Anfield. However, Alisson twice made mistakes with the ball at his feet, presenting passes to Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva, who found Gundogan and Raheem Sterling respectively to put City 3-1 ahead. Foden fired home an emphatic fourth to cap a clinical performance from Pep Guardiola’s side, who are five points clear of second-placed Manchester United after condemning Liverpool to a third straight home defeat.
