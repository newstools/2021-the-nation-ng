 USA coach Dawn Staley has said that they would not underrate D’Tigress when they clash in one of the group matches of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The Americans team are drawn in Group B alongside Nigeria, France and Japan in the first round of the women’s basketball tournament of Tokyo Olympic Games as USA gun for a seventh consecutive Olympic gold medal in Tokyo. Incidentally, USA beat Nigeria by just five points at the FIBA Women’s Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belgrade one year ago, and coach Staley said: “Nigeria is getting better every year, France is always a tough team to play and Japan has such a different style of play than what were used to seeing, plus they’re the home team. We are not looking past any of these opponents. We know that we will have to beat the best of the competition to make it to the top of the podium.” Meanwhile, Japan’s coach Tom Hovasse has accepted his team will be the underdogs against the USA and will probably be viewed as such against France, too. Having watched a video replay of Nigeria versus USA at the OQT in Belgrade, Hovasse said: “Nigeria was up 16 points at half-time. USA led for the first time with like three minutes in the game. Nigeria’s going to be difficult, they’re very physical. France is going to be tough and the USA is the USA – it’s a tough group.” The tournament will be staged between July 26 and August 8;the FIBA Women’s EuroBasket was already slated for this year and will be staged before the Olympics, from June 17 to June 27.
