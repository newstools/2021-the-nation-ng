The number of COVID-19 cases across the country last week decreased by 13.4 per cent, from 11,179 to 9,676, according to a recent situation report (Jan. 25th to Jan 31st) by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Noting that the decline in the number of confirmed cases does not mean a decline in the number of new cases, the agency urged states to prioritise testing and identifying cases to effectively control the acute phase of the pandemic. The report further showed that the number of international travellers with a positive result dropped from 615 two weeks ago, to 471 last week. Also, three states – Kogi, Kebbi and Cross River – had the lowest number of cases in one week – 0, 3, and 6 cases each. With regards to the number of tests carried out in the last week, the report showed that six (6) states had scored the lowest. The states were – Borno (434), Cross River (316), Kogi (531), Kebbi (432), Yobe (401), and Zamfara (322).  Lagos, FCT, and Rivers states carried out the highest number of tests in one week – 325,025; 186,497; and 117,049 tests respectively. In terms of recoveries, Lagos, Kaduna, Plateau and Rivers states had the highest number of recoveries – 4,402; 670; 639; and 483 recoveries each. Sadly, Lagos, Oyo, FCT, and Kano states recorded the highest number of deaths – 22,13, 7 and 6 deaths respectively.
