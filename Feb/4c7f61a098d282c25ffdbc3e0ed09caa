Speaking at the press conference to announce the NIN enrolment at the weekend in Lagos, its Managing Director, Mr Ayotunde Kuponiyi said the bank was delighted to partner the Federal Government through National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) on the NIN registration, noting that this would afford Nigerians the opportunity to register and capture their biometrics seamlessly and quickly. “We are committed to working with the Federal Government to ensure that every citizen enrolls for NIN as this would mean an easier identification process that had been lacking,” Kuponiyi said. He explained that Nigerians could register online through the bank’s platform and visit the nearest enrolment centre to capture biometrics. He further stated that the bank has intensified effort to expand the number of enrolment centers as it is currently recruiting thousands of agents that will set up centres for enrolment all across the country. “The process of onboarding as agent is very simple, prospective agents can log onto our website (www.hopepsbank.com) and enroll first as an Agent of Hope Payment Service Bank and then register to become agent for NIN registration,” he explained. While commending the Federal Government through the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy for expanding the registration footprints to the bank, he assured of the bank’s readiness to make the registration easier through the platform. Nigerians can register for NIN enrollment by filling the NIN form on Hope PSbank website (www.hopepsbank.com) or mobile app, and then go to any of our centers for data capture by presenting just their phone numbers and means of identification. This will significantly reduce the waiting period at the capture centers, he said. According to Kuponiyi, once the registration is completed, the customer will receive a message which says “thank you for starting your registration, please visit our nearest center or outlet for your data capturing”. He revealed further that the customer can view the authorized enrollment centers for biometric capture as contained in the message sent to him or her. “We understand how important this exercise is to Nigerians and we are ready to play our part by ensuring that Nigerians get their NIN through our platform which can be accessed in various designated enrolment centres, “We are quite excited to be the only PSB currently undertaking the NIN registration exercise,” he noted. The Managing Director of the digital bank further described the initiative of the bank for NIN registration exercise as a further testament to the quality of services and technological infrastructure available to customers. Also speaking on the project, its Chief Marketing Officer, Mrs. Kathleen Erhimu said all necessary arrangements and facilities have been put in place to make the exercise seamless, stressing that adequate personnel have been deployed to all the enrolment centres to make the process much faster than currently experienced.COVID-19 protocols are also duly observed. “We advise Nigerians, most particularly our esteemed customers to visit all the enrolment centres with necessary requirements for their registration.
