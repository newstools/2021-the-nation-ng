 The Lions Club International has identified with cancer patients in Osun State as part of its community development and advocacy efforts. The District 304 B2 of the club located in Ile-Ife, organised cancer awareness programme to sensitize Nigerians on how to prevent the deadly disease while also identifying with patients to motivate them to overcome their ailment. In his lecture entitled: “A Cancer-free Life is Not Impossible,” the Chairman Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife Oncology Group, Prof. Oludayo Sowande, explained that cancer could occur at any age. Sowande, who is also the Dean Faculty of Health Sciences of the institution, further explained that lumps are symptoms of cancer but that it is not in every case. He said in Leukemia, for example, which is cancer of the blood, the cancer multiplies in the blood without forming lumps, meaning that one can have cancer without developing lumps. According to him, cancer may originate from anywhere in the body, hence there is cancer of the stomach, of the lungs, of the breast and of the blood. Any tissue in the body can give rise to cancer, he said. “Cancer grows rapidly and that’s what differentiates it from other lumps in the body. And it has the tendency to leave the tissue where it originated.” Sowande said. The management team of the club, led by the District Governor Dr Ademola Adesoye, paid a courtesy visit to the Chief Medical Director of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex (OAUTHC), Prof Victor Adetiloye. While welcoming them, Adetiloye used the occasion to call on government at all levels to create a special fund for the treatment of cancer patients in the country. They later visited cancer patients’ ward in the hospital during which they counselled them.
