 The budding songstress, Faith Chimchetaram Uchendu aka Dopree has dropped her first single of the year titled, ‘My Baby.’ The song, which was produced by Kobasaund, was released on February 1, under her new management company, Illumi-nation. According to the singer, who disclosed her stage name is an acronym for ‘Daughter of Prophecy,’ she wants to preach love through her songs. “As a preacher of love, I hope to make more impact in relationships and marriages via my music. My Baby is my second official single. The song is inspired by love and when it comes to love, God is the greatest. Other times, I’m inspired by my life experiences and that of others,” she said. On her challenge as a rising star, she submitted that finance is a major constraint. “Of course, majorly financial investment. Because of how competitive the Nigerian music industry is, you need a lot of marketing to cut through the noise and for your music to stand out, albeit good. But I’m making traction and with the support of Illumi-nation, we have been able to draft out a plan.”
