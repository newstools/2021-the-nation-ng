 There are doubts over the hosting of the 2021 edition of the Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards, AMVCA, The Nation, has learned. In a recent chat with Busola Tejumola, the Executive Head, Content, MultiChoice Nigeria, the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic is stalling plans or preparation for the awards ceremony. Tejumola noted that Multichoice would love to host the awards ceremony but the re-emergence of the coronavirus with a second wave has left Multichoice management’s hands tied. “Again, we can’t assure you but we all know that the coronavirus second wave is disrupting a lot of activities. Ordinarily, we would have sent out calls for entry submissions and nominations would have been out by now but the pandemic is stalling the process, hence, we can’t plan or say for now if it will hold or not. We know the AMVCAs has become one of – if not – the most prestigious film and TV awards on this continent and many African films and Tv practitioners look forward to it,” Tejumola noted. Multichoice Nigeria’s Chief Customer Officer, Martin Mabutho, also chipped in on how the TV company is battling the coronavirus from its end. Mabutho listed some of the company’s relief strategies deployed during the first wave of the pandemic which includes cash donations of N200 million and N50 million to the Federal Government and Lagos State Government respectively, N400 million to the creative industry, whose professionals experienced disruptions in productions; donation of 30,000 Personal Protective Equipment and 30,000 face masks to hospitals and Non-Governmental Organisations as well as an approved inventory worth over N550m highlighting NCDC’s COVID-19 helplines and PSA materials on over 10 channels on DStv and GOtv.
