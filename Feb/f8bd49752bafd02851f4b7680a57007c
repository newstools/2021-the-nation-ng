The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board(JAMB) and tertiary institutions have agreed to close admissions for the 2020/2021 Academic session by 15th June, 2021. The decision was collectively taken at a virtual meeting attended by heads of trtiary institutions last week, JAMB’s Head of Information, Dr Fabian Benjamin, said in a statement on Sunday. The statement said Registrar of JAMB, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede used the meeting to know the progress tertiary institutions had made on the 2020/21 admissions scale. It noted the goal of the interactive meeting was to forestall an endless admission regime generated by the series of disruptions to daily life occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.
