Nollywood Actress Wini Lazarus has dedicated her latest film, “My Body, My Pride,” to Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello. Wini said Bello was deserving of the award because his government recognises women by bestowing different political appointments on them. Lazarus said the script of the film shares the ideologies and thoughts of the governor, which are evident in his various activities. Speaking on the similarities, Lazarus said her movie is centred on the marriage institution and factors that strengthen the home, adding that Governor Bello is equally toeing the same line by empowering women via job provision and appointing a large number in various positions in his state, thereby financially equipping them to support their families, which also translates to building enduring homes and a healthy nation at large. Aside from Bello, Wini explained that her new project is also dedicated to Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii and Dr. Felix King Eiremiokhae, for using their respective Foundations in uplifting various home front by contributing their lots to women and widows via their foundation. She said their immense contributions to some less privileged individuals have enabled them to aspire and live their dreams. The film also recognises the former first lady of Lagos State, Senator Oluremi Tinubu whose New Era Foundation shares similarities with Wini’s pet project, ‘ building the future’ for senior secondary school students in Nigeria. Speaking on her movie, Wini said: “It is a beautiful family story, about a couple who chose not to give up amid a series of matrimonial cobwebs. The story teaches married couples how to live their lives. Although it is not my first movie, this movie takes me a step further from acting.” ‘My Body, My Pride’ features Eddie Watson, Peggy Ovire, Wini Lazarus, and Monica Friday.
