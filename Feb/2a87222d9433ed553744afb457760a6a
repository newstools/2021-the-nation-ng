Two lovers have died in mysterious circumstances in their apartment along NDDC road in Amukpe, Sapele LGA in Delta State. A community source identified the victims as Ufuoma and Matilda Alome. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onowakpoyeya who confirmed the incident said: “When the police visited the venue, they prevented us from going in, so the case was not officially reported.” The Nation gathered that the victims were reportedly found dead after neighbours peeped through the window and saw two of them dead with one allegedly found on the floor and the other on the bed. A source who pleaded anonymity said the lovers attended a party the previous night. “They came home late after the party and slept off yesterday, only to wake up this morning and we found them dead.” According to the source, Ufuoma and Matilda had just returned to the country last year from an undisclosed overseas’ country and had reportedly moved into the vicinity last December. The source said of the one of the deceased, “He occasionally uses his vehicle to shuttle between Sapele and Warri route, and he was a lively fellow who was always visible and when neighbours woke up that morning and noticed his vehicle was there and there was no sign of the wife and him, we became worried, his window was opened but when we noticed his door was locked inside, we became curious, that was when we looked through the windows and saw the dead bodies.” However, another source said that their deaths may have been as a result of inhaling generator fumes. “Their generator was put on yesterday when they came back and we are suspecting it must have been the cause of their death.”
