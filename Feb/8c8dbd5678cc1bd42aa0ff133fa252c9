Ogun State was agog recently, and it was at the request of a Lagos socialite, Olamilekan Gaji, who staged a fitting birthday celebration in honour of his mother. The gig held in the city of carnivals, Ijebu Ode, had Fuji music czar, K1 De Ultimate on the bandstand and it played host to National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) top brass, Musiliu Akinsanya, a.k.a. MC Oluomo. While serenading Oluomo, K1 gave a hint that a grand wedding would be held sometime in March while charging his friends to get ready for the mother of all shows. After so much hide-and-seek, Oluomo is these days often spotted with only one lover, Ehizogie Ogbebor, an upscale interior decorator. Was the Fuji star hinting about nuptials for the lovers? Their romance had first sparked torrents of reactions on the social media owing to Ehizogieâ€™s long silence until January when she granted an interview and the mother of two talked about giving marriage another chance.
