The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, on Monday, stressed that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration will never tamper with the independence of the media. Adesina spoke on AriseTV The Morning Show monitored by The Nation. Reacting to the question the Buhari government has allegedly tampered with media freedom especially with the shutting down of an online news platform — Peoples Gazatte, he refuted the claims saying the current administration will never tamper with the independence of the media. He said, “…This government never clamped down on the media, it has never done, and will never do.. This government will never tamper with the independence of the media, and freedom of the press. If any columnist is alleging that, it is within his right… “Peoples gazette is a paper that lies everyday. It has lied against me, and has lied against several people. So why should we bother ourselves against a platform that is full of lies?”
