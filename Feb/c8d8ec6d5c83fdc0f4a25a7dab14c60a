Premier League leaders Manchester City are now seven points clear at the top of the table after an impressively easy 3-0 victory over Tottenham at the Etihad. If Jose Mourinho cannot stop Manchester City, you have to wonder if anyone can. The Tottenham manager could always be relied upon to find a way of upsetting Pep Guardiola’s attacking football and trip up an expected march to success. However, on Saturday evening, there was never any sign of Mourinho ending City’s winning streak, which has now been extended to 16 matches in all competitions thanks to a comfortable 3-0 victory at the Etihad. This was the biggest winning margin between the two coaching greats since Guardiola’s era-defining Barcelona side thrashed Real Madrid 5-0 at Camp Nou in 2010.
