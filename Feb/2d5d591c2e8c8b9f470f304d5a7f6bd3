Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has confirmed Wilfried Zaha will miss their Premier League trip to Leeds United on Monday. The 28-year-old suffered a hamstring injury on Wednesday during the Eagles’ 2-1 win over Newcastle United and he was replaced by Andros Townsend in the 58th minute. Zaha recently returned from a knock but he has made 19 league appearances for Crystal Palace this season and he is the club’s top scorer with nine goals and two assists. After confirming Zaha’s absence for the clash with Marcelo Bielsa’s team, the former England and Liverpool manager does not have a timeframe for the return of the Ivory Coast international. “We don’t know how long it’s going to keep him out,” Hodgson said in his pre-match press conference. “He certainly won’t be available for this game, and it could be much longer than that.” “At the moment, of course, it’s the early stage of the injury and he’s still being assessed. It’s totally unrealistic to suggest he’d be ready for this game.”
