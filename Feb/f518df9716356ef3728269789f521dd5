 Three officers and a soldier attached to the Federal Operations Unit (FOU) Zone ‘A’ of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), sustained bullet wounds during an attack by hoodlums working with smugglers. According to a statement signed by the Unit’s Public Relations Officer, DSC Theophilus Duniya, officers of the unit while acting on intelligence, intercepted six vehicles laden with foreign parboiled rice at Abeokuta Express Way. The incident happened earlier in the week. “Upon the interception, some armed hoodlums working in support of smugglers swiftly mobilised themselves and attacked our officers in their bid to prevent the seizure from being taken away. “However, in the cross fire that ensued, our operatives overpowered them and were able to evacuate three out of the intercepted vehicles to the warehouse”, the statement disclosed. The three injured Customs officers and soldier are currently receiving treatment at the Service’s medical facility, while further investigation into bringing the perpetrators of the attack to book has commenced. The Ag. Controller of the command, Deputy Comptroller Usman Yahaya, expressed concern about the injuries inflicted on the officers, which it said were ‘totally avoidable’, if only the youths were patriotic enough to know that the officers were just performing their lawful duties. He also cautioned the youths to reject being used by economic saboteurs to confront operatives of the Service from carrying out their lawful duties. Yahaya, while thanking the law abiding citizens for supporting the Zone’s operations, also warned people with criminal intentions to immediately desist from such because officers of the Unit are well mobilised, backed up by the extant laws and shall remain resolute at enforcing the laws without fear of intimidation.
