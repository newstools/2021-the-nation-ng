The General Manager, Lagos State Public Procurement Agency, Mr. Fatai Idowu Onafowote, has appealed to accounting officers of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) for more collaboration, to enable the agency discharge its services more effectively. He spoke at a sensitisation programme organised by the agency for permanent secretaries of ministries and chief executive officers of state-owned parastatals, on the deployment of e-procurement solution modules to the public procurement process. Noting that the use of technology had assisted the agency to drive the business of the government, Onafowote said it would integrate 97 MDAs on the e-procurement platform this year. He added that an average of 24 of these will be integrated into the platform in each quarter of the year. He expressed satisfaction with the support the agency had been receiving from the MDAs. Onafowote urged accounting officers to provide the tools required by procurement officers working with them, to enable the officers discharge their duties. He hailed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his support, which he attributed to the success achieved by the agency in the deployment of technology in carrying out its functions. Permanent secretaries, directors-general, general managers and other chief executive officers of selected MDAs attended the one-day sensitisation programme held at Protea Hotel, Central Business District, Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos.
