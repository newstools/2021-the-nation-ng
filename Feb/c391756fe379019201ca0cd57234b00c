The Federal University  Oye-Ekiti Students’ Union (FUOYESU) has told  the newly-inaugurated Vice Chancellor, Prof. Sunday Abayomi Fasina, to prioritise students’ welfare and build on the legacies of his predecessor Prof. Kayode  Soremekun. The union spoke  through its president, Alabi Johnson Sunday at the inauguration of the new VC. Fasina was inaugurated last week on  the campus  in Oye-Ekiti. The SU President, Alabi Johnson Sunday, urged the VC to attract investors to facilitate development in the institution. He said: “This is an unforgettable phase in the history of FUOYE, as we’re experiencing a transition in leadership both at the institution’s apex level and the SUG. “It is our desire that your administration focus more on the numerous needs of our students ranging  power supply within the campus to the provision of security lights. Priority should also  be placed on erection of more conducive lecture halls, engaging and retaining outstanding students to motivate others. “We’re very optimistic that your tenure as VC will be a peaceful and successful one,” he said. Fasina in his speech, entitled  “Building the FUOYE of Our Dreams,” promised to launch a process of dialogue and reconciliation with all aggrieved parties. He also pledged his commitment towards putting in place measures to enhance the institution’s  Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), vowing  to reposition FUOYE. “We need everybody on board to build the FUOYE of our dream. We will try and create wealth for the university through what I call Risk to Wealth Initiatives (RWI),” he said. Dignitaries at the event included  Ekiti State Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, whio represented the Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi; and Commissioner for Culture, Arts and Tourism, Prof. Ojo Bakare.
