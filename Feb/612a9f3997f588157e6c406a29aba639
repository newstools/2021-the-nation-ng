A Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has ordered a witness to produce his COVID-19 test certificate in the next sitting to confirm claims by his lawyer that he was exhibiting the symptoms. Iky Amadi was billed to give evidence in a suit between Yesin International Nigeria Limited and  Wema bank, presided over by Justice James Omotosho on Tuesday, but he was absent at the sitting. The plaintiff’s lawyer, B. Ejekwu, said the witness was ill and presenting symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, so he advised he take the test to ascertain his status. Ejekwu prayed the court to oblige them another opportunity in March to allow the witness be fit enough to come to court. He added that he earlier informed the defence lawyer of the development. The defence lawyer did not object to the application, and Justice Omotosho granted it, but ordered that the witness filed the COVID-19 test certificate before the next adjourned date to proof Ejekwu’s claims. He said: “This matter is adjourned till March 16 for hearing. The witness, Iky Amadi, is ordered to file the COVID-19 test result in whose instance this adjournment is granted before the next sitting.”
