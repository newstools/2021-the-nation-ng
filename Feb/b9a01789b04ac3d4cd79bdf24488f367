Budding singer and songwriter, Pabrymo is making waves with the release of his new EP entitled Ecstasy. The singer insisted that he was unbothered by the growing number of music stars trying to find their voices as he has his eyes on keeping his fans entertained all through the year. Signed under Woke Entertainment, Pabrymo says he can’t wait to give his fans something fresh from a number of projects lined up for the year. He maintained that he would not be a one-time star who goes off the scene after dropping a hit song. “I am glad about the dimension my music career is taking and I hope to keep the fire burning. It may not come easy, but I am gifted with all that it takes to succeed. “My EP, Ecstacy is a pointer to the fact that I am heading for the top. The EP is doing the numbers across platforms and I am super proud of the success it has recorded. Right now, the focus is to keep the music going while my team focuses on the business aspect of the job,” he said.
