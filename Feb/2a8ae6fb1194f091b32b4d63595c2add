The beautiful golf course of Ikoyi Club 1938 recently hosted golfers who participated in a one-day tournament held in honour of the Lady Captain of the golf section, Edith Udegbe whose tenure has come to an end. It was a thrilling day as golfers, especially those who have not played the game for a while due to the pandemic honoured the event tagged: ‘Edith Udegbe 2021.’ Popular Lagos monarch, Oba Saheed Elegushi, who is also a golfer, spoke glowingly of Udegbe. He said: “I met Lady Edith on the golf course here and we became close. I know that she has a very good spirit; she is respectful, diligent and has good morals. I do call her a tomboy because she does everything men do.” Also, the Vice Captain of the Ikoyi Club golf section, Dr. Meckson Innocent Okoro described Udegbe as cheerful and dutiful. According to him, she made sure that ladies’ voices are heard and their interests were catered for. While noting that her tenure was marred by the advent of COVID-19, Udegbe lauded everyone who contributed in making her reign a successful one.
