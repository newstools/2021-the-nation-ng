Renault has posted its biggest full-year loss on record as restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 wrecked auto sales in its key market Europe. The French manufacturer reported a net loss of 8 billion euros (US$9.7 billion) for last year, worse than the 7.85 billion euros deficit forecast by analysts. Much of the damage was done during the first half, when lockdowns crippled auto-shipments. This year “is set to be difficult given the unknowns regarding the health crisis, as well as electronic components supply shortages. The priority is profitability and cash generation,” Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo. Renault said business improved significantly during the final six months of last year, when it generated an operating margin of 3.5 percent and positive automotive operational free cash flow. De Meo took over in July last year after his predecessor was ousted as part of the fallout from the arrest of former CEO Carlos Ghosn. He is pushing through plans aimed at shoring up profits, repairing the troubled partnership with Nissan Motor Co, and cutting costs by closing sites and eliminating 14,600 jobs.
