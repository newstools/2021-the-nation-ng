Former Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose has endorsed the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Bisi Kolawole, for governor in next year’s election. The endorsement will not affect his current position as chairman, the former governor said. Fayose on Sunday in solidarity, stormed the Efon-Alaaye home of Kolawole, who has been his ally since when he was governor. He was received by the party chairman, his wife and Efon Local Government PDP chairman, Yemi Ajanaku. Kolawole, a former councillor and member of the House of Assembly was Environment commissioner during Fayose’s second term. There is calm in the chapter over the endorsement. Other potential governorship aspirants, including Prof. Olusola Eleka and former Governor Segun Oni were said to be awaiting clarification and confirmation from the party leader, Fayose. Ekiti PDP is currently divided along two factions, led by Fayose and Senator Biodun Olujimi. The court recently affirmed Kolawole as the authentic party chairman. The group led by Mrs Olujimi is threatening to go on appeal. The zonal leadership is planning to reconcile the two camps.
