Kylian Mbappe scored twice as second-placed Paris St-Germain beat bottom side Dijon in Ligue 1. Moise Kean, on loan from Everton, slotted in an early opener for Mauricio Pochettino’s side. Mbappe then scored a penalty and curled home a fine second, his 113th goal for the club. Danilo headed in a late fourth from Julian Draxler’s corner but PSG remain one point below Lille, who face Strasbourg in a game in hand on Sunday.
