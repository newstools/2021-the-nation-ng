The Lagos State Government has restated its commitment to the welfare of its pensioners. At the 82nd Bond Presentation to 292 pensioners whose Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs) were credited with N1.5billion, the Director-General, Lagos State Pension Commission (LASPEC), Mr. Babalola Obilana, assured retirees of the government’s commitment to their well-being. He said previously bond certificates were released to Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs), but that to ensure efficient service to retirees, the agency embarked on issuing the certificates to pensioners. He said: “LASPEC has gone beyond the excuses of retirees waiting endlessly before they can gain access to their funds, the world is moving forward and so are we. We are dedicated to our retirees because they have painstakingly contributed their quota towards making a Greater Lagos.” Obilana urged the retirees to ensure that they do proper documentation to avoid delays in payments due to wrong or missing documents. The retirees were also enjoined to be wary of fraudsters. Earlier, the Principal Legal Officer, LASPEC, Ms. Abimbola Akintayo, gave an overview of options available to retirees, stating that the two options available were Programmed Withdrawal and Annuity. She advised the retirees to choose an option based on their circumstances and not follow the crowd.
