 Villarreal coach Unai Emery is delighted with Samuel Chukwueze’s recovery from injury. The Nigeria international traveled with the Villarreal squad to Austria for the Europa League round of 32 first leg clash against Red Bull Salzburg but remained rooted to the bench for the entirety of the game.
Chukwueze was an ever-present in Villarreal’s MatchDay squad for domestic competitions before suffering a groin injury that required surgery, with the Basque manager picking him for twenty games in a row including two Copa del Rey matches.
His match fitness was not up to the required level so there was no point rushing him back in Thursday’s game at the Red Bull Arena.
On Chukwueze, Emery told reporters: “Samu has already joined, he was on the bench, warmed up and is, after a certain period of inactivity, closer to being able to count on him and reaching the demands and performance we want. He gives us more options.”
So much has happened since Chukwueze’s last game in La Liga against Celta de Vigo on January 8, with the Yellow Submarine failing to win any of their five matches without their number 11 in the squad.
