Leader Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has.described as ridiculous and fallacious media report that he has changed IPOB’s name and converted it to his private estate with his wife, Mrs. Uchechi Okwu Kanu, as one of the signatories. Kanu who spoke through IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, noted that the claims emanated from “a faceless group masquerading as Coalition of South East Professionals Network in Nigeria and Diaspora (CSEPNND), which he said  only exists in the imagination of those behind the rumour. “There is no iota of truth in the claims which only confirms that the DSS has run out of ideas in its propaganda war against IPOB. Assuming but not conceding to this tissue of lies, when and how has who owns and runs IPOB become the headache of these dullards? We thought they said IPOB is an organization of miscreants run by a lunatic? How come the Nigerian government is suddenly beginning to lose sleep over the ownership of IPOB- the assembly of miscreants? He queried: “What is the name of the business they said our leader registered? When was it registered?  Who are the directors of the business and their address? Can they produce a company’s house entry to confirm their allegations?
