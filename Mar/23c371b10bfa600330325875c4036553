President Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration would do everything possible to defend the nation’s school system against bandits, kidnappers and terrorists trying to destroy it. The President spoke with regards to recent worsening cases of kidnappers and bandits’ attacks on schools and abduction of hundreds of school children, in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu. President Buhari commended efforts of the Kaduna State government and the early response of the military which led to the rescue of 180 students including eight staff members but urged that the others declared missing be found and returned safely to their families. The President also commended efforts and contributions of local intelligence in significantly thwarting the kidnappers, saying that a country which has an efficient local intelligence network is a safer country. “Our military may be efficient and well-armed but it needs good efforts for the nation’s defense and the local population must rise to this challenge of the moment,” the President said. President Buhari expressed sympathy with the victims of this incident and hoped for an early end to the ordeal of those still held captive.
