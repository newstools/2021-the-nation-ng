Many people were reported injured and properties looted on Wednesday after cultists clashed in Ikosi area of Ketu, a Lagos community. Guns, cutlasses and bottles were freely deployed in the clash which reportedly started on Tuesday night on Ikosi Road, barely 48 hours after the state government signed into law the 21-year jail term for cultists and members of unlawful societies.  Bus passengers were attacked, bystanders robbed at knifepoint. Residents lamented the outbreak of violence on social media. Spokesman for the 81 Division, Major Olaniyi Osoba told The Nation that soldiers responded to a distress call in Ikosi and assisted in restoring normalcy to the area, adding “till our men left there, there was no report of anyone shot.“ Police spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi said 15 suspects were arrested and two locally-made pistols, live cartridges and assorted charms recovered.
