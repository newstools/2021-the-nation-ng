Senator Ita Giwa has hosted BBNaija Season 5 winner, Laycon to a lavish reception at her upscale restaurant and dance bar, Echoes of Calabar. The event was held in collaboration with Azuka Ogujiuba’s MediaRoomHub on Friday, March 12. The close-knit event had the presence of several industry heads that include On-air Personalities, music writers, and entertainment journalists. Speaking at the event, Laycon’s host, Ita Giwa said, “I’m star struck seeing my son, Laycon here today. During the lockdown, I was in Calabar when his fellow housemate, Lucy, was evicted and we had a reception for her alongside my carnival team. I try to encourage the next generation so that we can have a better Nigeria and this is one of the reasons I decided to host Laycon when Azuka approached me. Laycon went to the house and made a great impression on millions of Nigeria and I thought it was important we host him here at the Echoes of Calabar.” After a question and answer session, Laycon took on the stage to thrill guests with some of the songs from his EP. The songs performed by Laycon include ‘Wagwan,’ ‘Fall for me,’ and ‘God Level.’ Responding to questions, the 26-year-old singer and rapper said, “ I’m very happy to be here, I thank mummy for having me here and I am grateful to the media for joining me here. I decided to share this moment with the media since I just released new music.” Speaking further, Laycon said, “Fall for me has a storyline that is real and the lines there are simply warning ladies not to fall for me, I know I like you but don’t pass this line. It’s something I have passed through, it’s something people pass through and something I have experienced and it’s real. “I’ve been keeping my dreads since 2018. I started having dreads in 2016 but I had to cut it because of my mum but then again, I started keeping it again and now my mum likes it.”
