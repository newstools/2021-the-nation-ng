Director-General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr. Osita Okechukwu, has blamed the ongoing nationwide strike of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) on refusal of Governors to grant autonomy to state legislatures. He said the hang-up by Governors at the Supreme Court against the Executive Order 10, 2020 signed by President Muhammadu Buhari, which gave life to financial autonomy of state legislatures and judiciary, has put on hold implementation of the order. In a statement in Abuja, Okechukwu bemoaned the truism paralyzed activities of legislatures at the state level nationwide. He said: “One is at a loss why the Governors are intransigent even after President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Executive Order 10, 2020 to give life to financial autonomy of State legislatures and Judiciary. “Imagine that in their opposition to Executive Order 10, they quickly adopted bi-partisan toga and headed to hang it on the maze of the Supreme Court’s shelf. This is a wake-up call to hold our Governors accountable and hasten good governance.” The All Progressives Congress chieftain appealed to Governors to stop blocking Buhari’s restructuring policy by granting financial autonomy to State Legislatures as enshrined in Section 121(3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). He argued that granting financial autonomy to state legislatures “will not only halt the ongoing nationwide protest by PASAN but become the entry point of real restructuring of our dear country. He maintained that “the independence of the legislature at the state level is one of the bedrock of liberal democracy.”
