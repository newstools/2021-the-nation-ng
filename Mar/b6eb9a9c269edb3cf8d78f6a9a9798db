Ola Aina was left frustrated by Fulham’s uncharacteristic mistakes on Saturday, but won’t be wallowing after the defeat by Manchester City. A resolute defensive display in the opening 45 kept the likely Champions at bay, but within quarter of an hour of the restart they were 3-0 up. With a clear abundance of team spirit in the Fulham ranks, it seems unlikely that this defeat will hit the players’ confidence ahead of Friday night’s clash with Leeds United. “No, no, I don’t think so,” Aina replied. “We’re raring to go, if we had Leeds in an hour we’d be ready to go. We’ll just recover well and get ready for that one.  “The positions we’re in, we have to just take it game by game. “Good or bad results, we have to take it and move on and look forward to the next one, because ultimately there’s a goal that we need to achieve at the end of the season, so we can’t dwell on bad results,” Aina said.
