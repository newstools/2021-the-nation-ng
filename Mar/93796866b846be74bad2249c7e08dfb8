Multinational mobile telecommunications company MTN Nigeria is basking in the euphoria for partly supporting the Super Eagles’ successful trip via the waterways to Port Novo for last Saturday’s 2021 AFCON qualifier against Republic, Benin. Though details of the Super Eagles contingent as per logistics were sketchy ahead of the trip to Port Novo aside the support of the Lagos State Government, it has been revealed MTN equally supported the round trip to Benin largely by providing two new boats and seven crew members, which specifically conveyed the players to Benin Republic. “The two boats were the newest among the seven used by the NFF for the trip. This was because the players, as main actors, were prime in the arrangement of the federation,” a reliable source close to the federation explained. The contingent, which included the NFF President Amaju Pinnick and 1st Vice President Seyi Akinwunmi, travelled on Friday and returned on Sunday after the Super Eagles ran away with a 1-0 win through a 93rd minute strike by Paul Onuachu. But NationSport gathered that the Super Eagles safe-ride to Benin would not have been possible but for the spirited cushion of MTN. “After making use of the MTN lounge, we also took off from their jetty on Friday and also docked there on Sunday,” the source added Incidentally, the Super Eagles described the experience as novel, adding the boat ride to Port Novo was incident free. “It was nice to travel on the boat,” towering goalkeeper Maduka Okoye told TVC on arrival in Port Novo.
