Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) George Moghalu has identified functional inland water transportation as solution to port congestion.. He said it will also help to protect and preserve the nation’s road infrastructure from decay. Speaking with journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, the NIWA boss argued the ports would be decongested once the inland waterways become operational. Moghalu, a governorship aspirant in the November Anambra election, said NIWA is committed to completing the ongoing construction of river ports across the country. “We are doing everything we can to make sure that our river ports are functional. The ports under construction are being completed and that they are functional because I believe very strongly that one of the ways to address the issue of ports congestion and infrastructural decay is to make our water ways functional, because all over the world bulk cargo are either moved by water or rail. “Our roads are not designed to carry the pressure they carry. If the waterways are functional, over 60 to 70 percent of the containers that arrive Lagos and Onne ports today have their final destinations either in Onitsha or Aba. “So if we can take those ones that are going to Onitsha and move them by water, if we take for example 50,000 containers out of the roads and move them by water, what we would have done is that we have removed 100,000 trailers from the roads and if we can do this and achieve it, I can assure you that we are good to go.”
