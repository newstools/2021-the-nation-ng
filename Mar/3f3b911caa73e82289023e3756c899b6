The Industrial Training Fund (ITF) on Wednesday empowered 255 unemployed youths with technical vocational skills after six months of intensive programme. Its Director-General, Joseph Ari said the programme which ended yesterday was suppose to start early last year but due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it started in August of the same year and lasted for six months. Ari stated this during the graduation of ITF/Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) in Abuja, stating that for the trainees to acquire professional certification, the ITF Model Skills Training Centre (MSTC) implemented the programme with three professional bodies. They are the Institute of Tourism Professionals of Nigeria (ITPN), Nigeria Association of Engineering Craftsmen (COREN) and CISCO Academy, who equipped them with skills in Industrial Automation and Mechatronics, instrumentation and process control, catering and event. The DG said given the hands on nature of the six months training which comprised of three months intensive training at the MSTC and three months practicalÂ  attachment the graduands will no doubt contribute immensely to the development of the national economy.
