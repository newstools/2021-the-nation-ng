Legendary musician, Mike Okri, is set to release his Extended Play (EP) record. Produced by the Mike Okri Entertainment Company, the event takes place on Saturday, March 27, 2021, with Sheyi Shey as a special guest. In his characteristic manner, the singer, songwriter, producer, novelist, and humanitarian has put together this EP, which comprises entertaining, original, fascinating and meaningful songs for general entertainment and education. Likened to a profoundly beautiful piece of art on canvas, blended in the uniqueness of Afro-high-life and western style, Mike’s music has strong musical lyrics in simple poetry, uplifts and heals the human spirit. An original Mike Okri trademark is backed by rhythm, harmony and soul which he calls “Afro -Mystic-Soul.” Easily viewed as the bridge between the old and the new generation of Nigerian musicians, Okri made a great musical impact among the young and the old from the 1980s; all through the 1990s; 2000s and he is still very much active and waxing stronger. He has won several music awards such as The Nigerian Music Awards (NMA), Fame Music Awards (FMA) and the Pan African Music Awards (PAMA) in Ghana. The crooner has four music albums to his credit: Concert Fever, Rhumba Dance, CRACKS and Rhythmysticals.
