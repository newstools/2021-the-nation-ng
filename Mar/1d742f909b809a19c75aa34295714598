Nigeria international  Victor Osimhen will be subjected to another round of tests tomorrow before he can be given  a clean bill of health  before making his return for Napoli. This much was disclosed by the neurosurgeon who treated the 21-year-old  forward , adding he won’t give the Napoli striker the all-clear unless he is absolutely sure there are no lasting effects from being knocked unconscious. In a Serie  A tie away to Atalanta, Osimhen  fell awkwardly during a game and hit his head on the ground, leaving him with head trauma and no memory of the accident. He has been undergone  medical examinations   but  Doctor Alfredo Bucciero maintained   the former  FIFA U-17 World Cup winner  needs further investigations. “I saw him on Tuesday and there are more tests planned on Friday,” Bucciero  reportedly told Radio Marte. He returned to training, but before we send him back out onto the pitch to play, we need to make absolutely sure he is in perfect condition. “There will be another MRI scan and then we’ll make a decision, of course in conjunction with the Napoli medical staff. “The issue now is about prevention, because he doesn’t need any treatment at this stage. We just need to monitor the bioelectrical activity, which can be knocked out of sync following a head trauma. “We just want absolute certainty that Osimhen is fine before we let him resume playing.” Meanwhile, Napoli hope to have the forward back for this weekend’s game with Bologna.
