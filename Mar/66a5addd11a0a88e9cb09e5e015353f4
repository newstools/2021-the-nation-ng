Tyson Fury’s father John has cast doubt over whether his son’s fight with Anthony Joshua will go ahead. Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn had claimed the pair signed a two-fight deal, but Fury Snr insists it means nothing until a date or venue has been arranged. He added that the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic means it is not the right time to stage such a showpiece bout. Fury Snr said on BT Sport: “What have they signed? They’ve signed nothing in my eyes. They’ve got no date, no venue, no nothing. “What does it mean if you can’t get a date and a venue? What does it mean if no one is willing to put the money?”
