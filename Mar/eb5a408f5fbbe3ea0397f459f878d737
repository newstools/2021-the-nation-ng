The Federal Parastatals & Private Sector Pensioners’ of Nigeria (FEPPPAN) has lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for the regular payment of their pensions since he took over power in 2015. Its President Comrade Temple Ubani, in a statement, said this was a departure from past when pensioners were paid irregularly. He praised the president for his care for pensioners. He however appealed to the president to help hasten the release and implement the circular on pension increase for retirees. He said: “The above notwithstanding, FEPPPAN acknowledges with gratitude, the promptness and consistency in the monthly payments of pensions under your administration since the inception of your regime in year 2015. This development is a clear departure from the inglorious practice preceding your presidency. “However, the non-implementation of pension increases, two years after implementing a minimum wage for workers in active service, is causing disquiet among pensioners in the Federation. “We are appealing to you, first as a fellow pensioner and secondly, as the Father of the Nation, to please ensure that justice is served by seeing to it that the Circular on Pension Increments is released without further delay,” he added.
