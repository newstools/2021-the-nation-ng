Mighty people were at the weekend arraigned at an Akure Magistrates’ Court in Ondo State for violating the restriction order on human and vehicular movement  during the monthly environmental sanitation. The suspects were arrested at parts of Akure. Presiding Magistrate Mr. Taiwo Lebi found them guilty and sentenced some of them to one week community service, while others were made to pay fine. The General Manager of the Ondo State Waste Management Authority, Mrs. Ayo Adeyemo, said the violators deserved the punishment because they were supposed to keep their surroundings clean. She said: “Over 80 people were arrested and they were made to face the sanctions according to the law of the state. The state government is not taking the cleanliness and the health of the people with levity. “ It is now compulsory for commercial drivers and vehicles owners to have waste bins in their vehicles, to curb littering of streets and highways.”
