A cleric of the Cherubim & Seraphim Church of Zion World Wide, Rev. Samuel Ogunfeyimi, has sent a save our soul letter to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu over lingering crisis in Ugbonla community in Ilaje local government over. Rev Ogunfeyumi said the crisis was occasioned by decision of some church leaders to jettison the last wish of his late father and founder of Ugbonla town and the C&S church, Dr. Elisha Lene Ogunfeyimi. Ogunfeyumi noted that the one way to having lasting peace in Ugbonla and environs is for his late father’s last wish be followed to the latter. He stated that his father shortly before his death, declared that the Conference should be in charge and head the church while his biological children should be the traditional head of Ugbonla town. Ogunfeyumi said his late father appointed three members of the conferences, Reverend Isaiah Jemine, Primate Ayodele Samuel and Primate Ogungbure Etajuwa to oversee the affairs of the church. According to him, “Unfortunately, since the demise of the founder, a lot of selfish interests have always contented against the declaration of my father to impose their will and this has always met different resistance in different ways hence, the absence of peace in the region as its by-product. “Your Excellency, while I am mindful of your efforts in restoring peace in Ugbonla and its environs and to boost your efforts and labor in this noble course, the only honorable, cheap and lasting ways of restoring and to guarantee peace in Ugbonla and its environs is by ensuring that the last day declarations of my father and founder of Ugbonla strictly adhere to. “The conferences of the church are allowed to determine the leadership of the church and that the biological children of my late father are allowed to be the traditional head of Ugbonla town. “Your Excellency, with strict compliance with the aforementioned, lasting peace will return to Ugbonla and his environs.”
