To boost women empowerment and capacity building, AXA Mansard, has collaborated with SME 100 Africa to empower women business owners. The event, which held at the International Women’s Day Conference, Abuja had as its  theme: ‘Choose to challenge: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world’. Among those who attended were the Chief Executive Officer, Sapphire Events Limited, Mrs. Funke Bucknor-Obruthe,  and Chief Executive Officer, Bookings Africa, Fade Ogunro and Greenhill Recycling Limited founded by Mrs. Mariam Lawani – a  social enterprise. The financial literacy session was anchored by AXA Mansard’s Investment Officer, Nneoma Mere.    The highlight of the session was the pitch session where    the grand  prize was N1 million. The Chief Customer and Marketing Officer, AXA Mansard, Mrs. Olajumoke Odunlami, said: “The pitch  was a thrilling and impactful experience for me. I am very privileged to have been a part of this session and to have seen the great things that women are doing in business. Women are the force for change and we must continue to strive to ensure that we are visible and relentless.” Mrs. Odunlami added: “AXA is committed to gender equality through implementation of gender initiatives as well as sound and inclusive policies, processes, and culture across the organisation. ‘’We believe that women are the key to progress as they are a vital force for growth and development around the world. ‘’We encourage women to take advantage of our SHE for Shield initiative which is tailored towards empowering women.
