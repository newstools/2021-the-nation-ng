 The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP), yesterday morning  in Katsina, said it will embark on a nationwide industrial action beginning April 6,2021, over what the union called ‘’culture of neglect by government on issues affecting the technological education sub-sector.’’ ASUP President, Anderson U Ezeibe, who addressed the press shortly at the end of the 99th meeting of the National Executive Council of the union held at Hassan Usman Polytechnic, Katsina, outlined six key areas affecting the polytechnic education which the federal government have consistently toyed with and have failed to address over the years to include: Non implementation of ASUP/FG agreement of 2010, Nonpayment of salaries and arrears of the new minimum wage in some state owned polytechnics, among others.
