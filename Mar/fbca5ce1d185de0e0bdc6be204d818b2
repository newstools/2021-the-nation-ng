 A lecturer in the Department of Business Management at the Covenant University Ota, Dr. Stephen Ukenna, has been arrested by the police in Ogun State for allegedly raping a teenage girl. The alleged victim is a 17-year-old student of the institution. Dr. Stephen, 41, was arrested following a complaint at the Ota Area Command by the girl’s parents, who reported that their daughter told them on the phone that she was invited by the lecturer to his office on Thursday under the pretext of planning a surprise birthday party for her close friend.  But on getting to Dr. Stephen’s office, he allegedly seized her, locked the office door and forcefully had sex with her atop a table  in his office. Police spokesperson Abimbola Oyeyemi, who disclosed this, said the Area Commander for Ota, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Muyideen Obe, deployed detectives to the school where they arrested the lecturer. The suspect has admitted having non-consensual sex with the victim, but was unable to give any reason for his action.
