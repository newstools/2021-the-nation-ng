 A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and 1993 Social Democratic Party’s (SDP’s) presidential aspirant, Chief Reuben Famuyibo, has declared interest in the 2022 governorship poll in Ekiti State. He said he joined the race to bring to the downtrodden masses’ doorsteps, the dividends and superlative services inherent in democratic governance. Famuyibo said he also joined the race to place Ekiti on higher purposeful pedestal where economic prosperity would be guaranteed. The business tycoon, who declared his interest in the plum position yesterday while consulting with elders and political heavyweights in Ado-Ekiti, said it was time the town’s indigene clinched the number political position. He said every political machinery would be deployed to actualise the dream of having an indigene of the town to assume office as governor in 2022.  Famuyibo, who contested the Alliance of Democracy governorship primaries with former Governor Niyi Adebayo in 1999, said he has an implementable blueprint that will engender radical development in Ekiti in the areas of industrialisation, job creation, social security, free education and health care policies. He said: “I have consulted with some elders and influential politicians in and outside Ekiti before I took this decision to contest the 2022 governorship election.” “I appeal to the APC stalwarts and all Ekiti people to join their faith with mine to make the state a better place for all and sundry. Our past leaders have tried, but I think I can do better if given the opportunity to serve.” Famuyibo said his team has begun aggressive mobilisation of the electorate to back his aspiration through a house- to-house consultations of party leaders to seek their blessings.
