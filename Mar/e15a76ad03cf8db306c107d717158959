Cross-dresser, Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju, popularly known as Bobrisky has thrown shades at under-fire fashionista, Toyin Lawani, for posing with provocative nun outfits. The fashionista had posted her pictures wearing nun and hijab outfits, which many Nigerians described as highly provocative and utterly distasteful. Bobrisky took to his Instagram page to subtly bash her even without mentioning her name directly. Bobrisky who referred to the fashionista as “sister”, advised her to find another source of income as she is no longer relevant on the internet space. He wrote: “Catch your sub. Sister go find another hustle. Your market don expire. “You were completely naked on IG, you no still famous, you try to break the internet, internet get coconut head e no break. “My sister find another hustle.”
