I led the four teams of the police to the scene of the crime. The armed robbers abandoned the car and fled into the bush with their loot. They aimed at entering the bank’s vault but they ended up stealing about N500,000 to N600,000 from one of the two ATMs at the scene of the crime. “The armed robbers were afraid of arrest, they could not attack any bank in the area, so they fled under 15 minutes,” he added.
