The United States of America (USA)-owned businesses in Nigeria declined from N1.08 trillion in 2019 to N1.47 trillion in 2020, no thanks to the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, The Nation has learnt. Making this disclosure recently was the President, American Business Council, Dipo Faulkner. He spoke during the Council’s virtual meeting. According to him, US companies’ impact on the Nigeria economy in 2019/2020 through gross value addition to the nation’s economic output, investment, jobs and communities declined. He noted that the total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Nigeria was N934.34 million in 2019, a 21.8 percent decrease from 2018. In his submission, Chijioke Uwaegbute, Partner PWC, said surveyed companies generated revenue of about N1.08 trillion in 2019 which was a decrease of 27 per cent as against the previous year. “In terms of full time employment, we have declined from 18,500 in 2018 to about 14,000 in 2019. On the average, the company spent about N32 million on a yearly basis on training with a minimum amount of N1.4 billion on training. This can only be a positive impact on developing manpower locally that can take over or build their own companies. There were over 30,000 indirect jobs created during the period under review. Over 13,000 direct jobs were created just as the businesses generated over N1 trillion in 2019 and spent N2.57 billion to expand operations in the last five years. There is a plan to invest about 2.37 billion going forward over the next three years.” Commenting on the Council’s CSR, which is a key area of focus for US companies, he noted that the companies spent 1.5 billion, stressing that the figure came from 1.9 billion expended in 2018. He pointed out that the US businesses contributed over a N100 million to Covid-19, stressing that some of some of the issues that affected their businesses include foreign currency access, government policies which remained a top issue, and uncertainty that impacts business decisions because of inconsistent policies. The Deputy Political and Economic Chief, US Consulate, Merrica Heaton, who expressed disappointment over the decrease recorded within the 2020 business year, stressed the need to focus how to wok the Nigerian government improve on American  investment in the country as well as attracting more investors. He stated that the N2.3 trillion budgeted for expansion in three years was a good sign in the right direction towards impacting investment that would create a sharp contrast due to the pandemic effects. Margaret Olele, Chief Executive Officer, ABC lamented that a lot of our companies have spent huge amount of money investing, setting up and manufacturing plants in the country, urging the government to create an enabling business environment to be able to generate the needed jobs. She stated that ABC has investment in different sectors, stressing that its investment is largest in sectors.
