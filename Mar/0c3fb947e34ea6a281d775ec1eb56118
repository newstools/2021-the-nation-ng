Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde has said seeking second term in 2023 will not stop him from blocking all necessary loopholes in public finance. He spoke at the public presentation of two books by the immediate past Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan Professor Temitope Alonge. The books are entitled “Public private partnership in health” and “Driven by passion, enabled by grace”. Makinde noted there are people within the system used to free money who are already angry with him for messing with their honey pots and blocking loopholes. The Governor said: “Is it all rosy? No. There are people within the system that are used to free money and they are still there. “And all they can say to me is that I am messing with their honey pots and have blocked loopholes they are making money from. “They do threaten me on 2023 ambition, saying I will come back again but I may or may not; that is the news for them. I will ensure that those loopholes remain blocked.”
