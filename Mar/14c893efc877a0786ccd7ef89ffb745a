 William Troost-Ekong believes injury-plagued Success Isaac can still fulfil his potential at Watford in the English Championship. Troost-Ekong who joined Success at Watford from Serie A side Udinese in 2020 was excited that his compatriot has featured in the last four games for the Hornets after Success started his first match in more than two years against Birmingham City. “I knew Isaac from the national team,” said Troost-Ekong on a player who was last capped by Nigeria in November 2018.  “He’s a player you don’t like to play against as he’s such a handful. He’s worked very hard to come back from injury and so I was really pleased to see him get some minutes. I hope he can kick on now and give us another attacking option. He is a great player and hasn’t really fulfilled his potential yet of what he can do and what he can offer. I hope it happens as he has got so much power and quality,” the Super Eagles defender added. Troost-Ekong wore his 46th  cap in Nigeria’s 1-0 away win to Benin Republic at the weekend and he is expected to be in action when the Eagles host Lesotho today at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos.
