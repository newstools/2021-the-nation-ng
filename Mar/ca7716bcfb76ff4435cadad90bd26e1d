For ages, there have always been battles between musicians and record companies owing to breaches of agreement or an artiste’s expectation not being met. But for talented singer, Joseph Abojei, also known as Blessed Boy, for any investor to respect and value an artiste in whom they will invest, such an individual must bring some financial value to the table. He said: “An artiste needs to have his own plans and must have pushed such a plan to a certain level before approaching an investor. An artiste should be able to tell an investor this is where I am, and your investment will only help me get to that point that I want to be”. According to the US-based artiste, music requires good money and an upcoming artiste needs to have another source of income to fund his career. He further stated that beyond talent, creativity and hard work, finance plays a major role in the success of a musician in Nigeria. “I work multiple jobs in America to finance the production and promotion of my songs but many upcoming artistes are always ashamed of their hustle. I am very proud of my jobs,” he said. Blessed Boy, who developed interest in music in the late 2000s, shortly before traveling out of the country, decided to pursue a singing career in 2011 and has since released over 20 tracks, including Babara, Ayedun-Chop Life, Save Us, Throw That, Great Call, Adara, My Hand, Precious, Take Over, Trophy, and Black” Hinting on his next project, he stated that he was working on a new track to be released on May 14 – his birthday.
