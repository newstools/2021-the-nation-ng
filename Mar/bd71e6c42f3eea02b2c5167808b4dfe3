National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu on Sunday said only peace and unity can save Nigeria from turmoil. He noted Kano and Lagos states have a cardinal job because of their cosmopolitan and tolerant nature to show Nigerians the way of peace. He also acknowledged the role traditional rulers can play in peace-building process. Calling for national integration, Tinubu, who spoke when he visited the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero in his palace, expressed optimism Nigeria can even excel if citizens reunite and make a positive change irrespective of their tribes, religions and various political affiliations. Tinubu said: “Nigeria is at a critical stage of life and the only thing that can make it survive is unity, peace and understanding. Lagos and Kano states, which have come through these over times, must lead and show the way. “Peace and development will elude if the country continues the way it is going. Fundamentally, peace and unity must be the hope to ride on. “One could see that today, I am sitting side by side with Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, and this is a clear testimony that people, regardless of their tribes and religions, could come together and make a change. “Use us as a symbol and make a difference; what Lagos and Kano have been doing together all these while. Nigerians should see unity in us and make the country great.”
