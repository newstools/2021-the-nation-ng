Notwithstanding the various tendencies threatening the unity of the country, Nigerians have been charged to accept the fact that they stand a better chance when they stick together as one nation. This was President Muhammadu Buhari’s message to Nigerians when he spoke as Special Guest of Honour at the 12th Asiwaju Bola Tinubu Colloquium, held in Kano on Monday. The President, who participated virtually in the event to mark the 69th birthday of the former two-term Governor of Lagos State, commended the celebrant for always being an advocate of unity and cohesion in Nigeria. President Buhari also noted that the best course of action for a better Nigeria, as had been indicated by the lessons from the series of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu Colloquia, are ensuring that justice and harmony reign in the country, and devoting national resources to the development of the nation, for the benefit of all citizens. On Nigeria’s unity, President Buhari said despite the occasional inter-ethnic tensions that have over the years become a frequent feature in Nigeria’s national history, and the different other fault lines like language, religion, diversity in ethnicity, Nigerians are better and stronger together.
