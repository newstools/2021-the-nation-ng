The ex-wife of popular Nollywood actor Blossom Chukwujekwu, Maureen Esisi aka Redvigor, has bragged she is the best thing that can ever happen to any man. She was responding to an insensitive troll directed at her on social media. The brand influencer had taken to her Instagram page to share a video of herself twerking and dancing to a song. The post obviously did not sit well with some individuals and a troll decided to blast her for sharing such a video online. The troll stated that Blossom had dodged a bullet by ending their four-year marriage in 2020 and Maureen was the problem. In response to the troll, she said she is the best thing that could ever happen to any man and her ex-husband can attest to that. She then dismissed the troll as a fool.
