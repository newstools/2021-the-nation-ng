Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule has raised the alarm over the regrouping of Boko Haram members in three local government areas of the State. The LGAs according to him include Wamba, Nasarawa and Karu. Karu LGA is sharing boundary with the FCT Abuja. The governor said this Monday in his opening speech during an expanded Security Council meeting at the Government House, Lafia. According to him “one of the reasons for calling the meeting is because of the security concerns around the country and indeed around the State. “From what we have seen so far, there are renewed activities of these dislodged bandits. “Unfortunately, a lot of them are members of Daru Salem that have turned into Boko Haram. They have actually re-grouped in places like Bakono, Kabusu, Pander, Danbata and Gidan Rice in Nasarawa, Wamba and Karu LGAs.”
