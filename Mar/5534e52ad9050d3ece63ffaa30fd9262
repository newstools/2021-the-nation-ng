Stakeholders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom have affirmed the Niger Delta Affairs Minister, Senator Godswill Akpabio as the authentic leader of the party in the state. Led by the party’s national caucus member and two-time military administrator of Rivers and Ogun states, Group Captain Sam Ewang (rtd), they made the affirmation at the weekend during a stakeholders meeting of the APC in Uyo. In attendance were the Niger Delta Affairs Minister, Senator Godswill Akpabio, interim administrator of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDCC), Mr. Efiong Akwa, former deputy governor of Akwa Ibom state, Mrs. Valerie Ebe, former House of Representatives members, Obongemem Ekperikpe Ekpo and Patty Ineme among others. However, the state leadership of the APC had through a press statement on Sunday dissociated itself from the stakeholders meeting convened by Ewang and called on members of the party to boycott it. The statement signed by the party’s publicity secretary, Mr. Nkereuwem Enyongekere said Ewang had no powers to convene a stakeholders meeting.
