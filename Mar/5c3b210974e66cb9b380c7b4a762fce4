Nigeria international duo of Joe Aribo and Leon Balogun have helped Glasgow Rangers win their 55th Scottish top-flight title with six more games to  spare. Rangers were confirmed champions after Celtic’s goalless draw against Dundee United at Tannadice on Sunday officially ended their bid for 10-in-a-row. Celtic needed to take maximum points from their trip to Dundee United after Rangers’ 3-0 win over St Mirren on Saturday took them to the brink of securing their first Premiership title since 2011. Former Rangers star Kris Boyd feels the Nigeria duo performed credibly, singling out Aribo for his brilliant spells during the season. “It’s a difficult one because so many players have played a big part in what Rangers have achieved this season,” Boyd told Sky Sports. “The likes of Filip Helander and Leon Balogun have not looked out of place. Scott Arfield had a fantastic October and November. He was the one who was making the difference then. “Joe Aribo has had spells where he’s made a difference. Alfredo Morelos is now finishing the season strong and Glen Kamara has had an excellent period as well.” Aribo played 25 times and scored six goals in his second season for the Gers since his move from Championship side Charlton in 2019 while Leon Balogun tasted league victory in just his first season for Rangers. The former Brighton and Wigan Athletic defender started 14 games and was a substitute four times in Steven Gerrard’s title winning run. Rangers were  undefeated in 32 games, recording a massive 28 wins and just four draws; scoring 77 goals and conceding just nine.
