Many Boko Haram and Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) fighters have been killed by troops of Sector 3 Operation Lafiya Dole, who were on clearance patrol on the fringes of Lake Chad, the military has said. However, one officer and three soldiers were killed, while several others were wounded in the attack. “Elements of Boko Haram Terrorists and their Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) counterparts operating along the fringes of the Lake Chad and the Tumbus met their waterloo when they encountered dogged troops of Sector 3 Operation Lafiya Dole on Saturday, 13 March, 2021,” Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima,. “The combined troops of the Sector who were on clearance patrol along the fringes of the Lake Chad had advanced and cleared Daban Massara and Ali Sherifti villages among other settlements before they harboured for replenishment and retrofitting. However, as they commenced the second phase of their operations and advancing along the Kukawa-Monguno Road, about 14 kilometers to their base, they sighted BHTs/ISWAP gun trucks and swiftly commenced pursuit with heavy fire and deft manoeuvre. “In the course of the hot pursuit which was aided by air cover provided by the Air Task Team of Operation Lafia Dole, several terrorists were neutralised and their gun trucks destroyed. Unfortunately however, one officer and three gallant soldiers paid the supreme sacrifice while those wounded in action are currently receiving medical attention at 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital in Maimalari Cantonment.”
