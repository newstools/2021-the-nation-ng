The Lagos State Police Command has released Kari Ann O’Rourke, the American lady held in custody since February 9, 2021. She was released on Wednesday according to her counsel, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN). Kari Ann was arrested at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport on February 8, 2021, following the death of her host in Nigeria, whom she left with his family in good health. Adegboruwa said in a statement the police arrested and detained Kari Ann at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba, Lagos. He added the police kept her in custody even when the autopsy report indicated that her host died of heart trauma and cardiac arrest, thus exonerating Kari Ann of any involvement in his death. When all efforts to get Kari Ann released on bail failed, she engaged human rights activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, to challenge her continued detention, following which a suit was filed at the Federal High Court, Lagos on March 18, 2021. In that suit, Kari Ann sought declarations against her arrest and detention, an order for her immediate release and N100m damages against the police. Kari Ann’s lawyers discovered, upon further investigation, that the case file had been forwarded to the Lagos State Ministry of Justice long ago and a legal opinion had been issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the extent that there was no prima facie case worthy of prosecution. Upon obtaining the certified copy of the above Legal Advice, Kari Ann’s lawyers insisted on her immediate release from unlawful custody, following which she was released on Wednesday, March 24, 2021, having spent over 44 days in illegal custody. Adegboruwa appealed to the police to show greater respect for the rights of citizens, stating that this case has shown the intolerable level of impunity prevalent within the law enforcement agencies. He lamented that Kari Ann was still being detained even after the police got the legal advice since March 5, 2021.
