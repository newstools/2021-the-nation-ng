So many Nigerian musicians got their start in the choir. Music is equivalent to church culture and the choir is vital to that.   Oluwatobi Wande Ojosipe popularly known as Wande Coal started singing in the teenage choir at his church. He got his break in the industry as a dancer before he got signed to Don Jazzy’s Mo’ Hits Records in 2006. Banky Wellington was born in the United States to Nigerian parents but the family moved back to Lagos when he was five. He started singing at a young age in his church choir. Ayodeji Ibrahim, better known as Wizkid, began singing at 11 in the church choir. A few years later, he formed a boy band, SI, while running errands in the studio where musicians 2face Idibia and Jazzman Olofin recorded circa in 2004. As a young singer, Waje sang gospel tunes to the delight of the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa. Idahosa was quite impressed with her singing and decided to help her during her entire secondary school days. Don Jazzy was a multi-instrumentalist in church. This informed his adroitness at music production. In 2000, Jazzy’s uncle invited him to play the drums for a local church in London and that was his first visit to London. Darey was born into a family of performers and like his father, he joined the wagon. Dare perfected his skills at an early age, singing with several choirs, including the National Troupe of Nigeria Choir and then the Cathedral Choir. Chidinma Ekile was born in Ketu, Lagos State to parents originating from Imo State. She is the sixth of seven children. Chidinma grew up with a disciplinarian father and began singing at six. She joined her church’s choir at 10.
