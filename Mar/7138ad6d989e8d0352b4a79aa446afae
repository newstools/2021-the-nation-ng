Enyimba have begun the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup with a 2-1 home win over Al Ahli Benghazi of Libya in a Matchday One tie played at the Enyimba International Stadium, Aba yesterday. First-half goals through Austin Oladapo and Victor Mbaoma in the ninth and the 45th minutes were enough to salvage the three points for the People’s Elephant even though the visitors briefly equalised Oladapo’s opener after a mix up in Enyimba defence. The People’s Elephant had goalkeeper, John Noble to thank for ensuring that the Libyans did not return to Benghazi with a share of the spoils with series of fantastic saves. Enyimba will travel to South Africa for a date with Orlando Pirates next week Wednesday in a Matchday Two encounter.
