There was heavy vehicular traffic along the Oyemekun-Oba Adesida road up to Alagbaka on Tuesday morning as men of the Ondo Amotekun Corps conveyed 300 seized cows to their headquarters. More than 100 cows were earlier seized on Sunday along the Akure-Ilesha highway for flouting the State government directives on open grazing and use of underage herders. The 300 cows were said to have been seized along the Ilesha highway. When contacted, Commander of the Ondo Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said he was in an operational area but promised to call back. He was yet to call as at press time.
