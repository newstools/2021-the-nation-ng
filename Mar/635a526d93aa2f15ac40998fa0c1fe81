The unprecedented global health crisis has thrown up the need for businesses to have a crisis management plan as revealed in a research by leading public relations firm, CMC Connect BCW, a member of the CMC Connect Group and an affiliate of Burson Cohn & Wolfe global communications agency. The research reported that between Q2 & Q3 2020, 27% of businesses in Nigeria suffered a major impact from the coronavirus pandemic, with only 9.9% of the respondents having a crisis management plan in place while 59% never had a crisis management plan before the COVID-19 pandemic. According to CMC Connect BCW, the research was carried out on over 200 business owners and employees and further revealed that 78% of respondents agreed that the existence of a crisis management plan was important in inspiring confidence in organisational leadership. The Group Managing Director, CMC Connect (Perception Managers), Mr. Yomi-Badejo-Okusanya said, “When a crisis occurs, there is a breakdown of trust between the organisation and its stakeholders. Trust is a currency on which stakeholder’s trade, and it defines their loyalty and goodwill. Once this is disrupted, the organisation is on its way down.” Business Director, CMC Connect BCW, Jerry Sawyerr reiterated that the service is not limited to organisations but also to government and individuals who are concerned about sustaining their brands regardless of crisis.
