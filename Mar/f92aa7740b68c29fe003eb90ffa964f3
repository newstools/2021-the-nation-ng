President Joe Biden unexpectedly missed his steps twice  yesterday as he climbed the stairs to Air Force One. He was on his way to Georgia. He had gone about one third of the stairs of the aircraft at Joint Base Andrews when he stumbled. Luckily for him,he got hold of the railing and steadied himself.  He took one more step only to   stumble a second time but   held firmly to the railing. However,he collapsed finally on the stairs after yet another missed step. He dusted himself up and made it to the top. He gave a salute and got inside the plane.
