Anthony Joshua already looking great in a sensational shape ahead of his undisputed heavyweight clash with Tyson Fury later this year. The unified champion has agreed to a staggering £500million deal with Fury, who holds the WBC title, for two eagerly-awaited bouts that are expected to go ahead in 2021. All that’s left to be sorted is the venue for their first contest, with Saudi Arabia reportedly leading the race to stage it. Joshua and Fury are likely to lock horns in the summer, meaning they still have around three to four months before they put it all on the line in the biggest British fight of all time The 31-year-old’s body is looking toned and powerful a few months out from his potential battle with Fury, which could crown the first undisputed heavyweight champion in over two decades. Many believe Joshua will be the outsider when he takes on Fury, who is widely considered the No.1 heavyweight on the planet after dethroning WBC champion Deontay Wilder in emphatic fashion last year. The Gypsy King is also undefeated in his 13-year career, which cannot be said of AJ following his shock loss at the hands of Andy Ruiz Jr back in 2019. Yet, heavyweight contender Dillian Whyte believes Joshua and Fury’s meeting is a 50-50 contest and can’t pick a winner. “There’s a case for both guys winning this fight, I think. Both guys showed a lot of versatility in their fights,” Whyte, who can reinforce a position as Fury’s WBC mandatory challenger by winning his rematch against Alexander Povetkin this weekend, told AK and Barak. “[Joshua’s] two fights with Ruiz and [Fury’s] two fights with Wilder – they’re the same guys but they’re different styles and different ways of getting the victory. “It’s hard, only true fans of each guy will say, ‘This guy’s gonna win. It’s very hard, I don’t think no boxing purist would say, ‘This guy’s gonna win because of this. “It’s hard to pick, in my opinion, it’s a 50/50 fight.”
