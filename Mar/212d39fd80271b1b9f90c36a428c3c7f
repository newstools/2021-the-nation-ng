The Federal Government has today issued the notice for the Highway Development and Management Initiative (HDMI) to commence the procurement for the twelve federal highway roads it intends to concession under its novel Highway Management Development Initiative (HMDI) conceived last year. Accordingly, the ministry has launched an e-portal commencing the procurement process for the twelve pilot federal highway roads for concession. Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN), stated that the e-portal was launched in order to ensure competitiveness and guarantee transparency and would serve as the interface with the public in the management of the HDMI from procurement to implementation. He said: Let me repeat that all our transactions will be done through this portal and we will not entertain any personal inquiries to me or to any of our staff who have correspondingly been mandated not to entertain such requests. He said that the portal:Â  https://hdmi.worksand housing.gov.ng/) would be opened for operation from next Monday and called on those who have written for enquiries to make use of it. The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Mr. Babangida Hussaini, stated that the ministerial notice on the commencement of the Highways Development and Management Initiative (HDMI) signaled the commencement of the procurement process for the concession of the twelve pilot broad corridors under HDMI. The Acting Director-General, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), Mr. Micheal Ohiani, said ICRC as a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) regulatory commission would ensure a level playing ground for all interested players.
