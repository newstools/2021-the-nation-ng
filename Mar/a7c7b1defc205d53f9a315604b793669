Ijaw leader Chief Edwin Clark was among the first personalities to be vaccinated by the Federal Capital Territory  Healthcare Board. The FCT commenced its own vaccination exercise on Monday with the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Mohammed Bello and the Minister of State Dr. Ramatu Aliyu. Acting Executive Secretary Primary Healthcare Board Dr. Iwot Ndeaeyo Akpan led the medical team to Clark’s No.48, Haile Salaise, Asokoro residence. Speaking after receiving the jab alongside members of his household,  the 93-year-old former Federal Commissioner for Information urged Nigerians to go out and get the vaccination for their own protection and safety. The Ijaw leader urged Nigerians to take the issue of safety very seriously.  In his remarks, Dr. Akpan said there has never been any case of side effect to warrant stoppage of the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria.
