Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State says the video posted on the internet in 2018 purporting that he received a bribe in dollar was fake, and designed to stop his reelection the following year. “No doubt the video is fake,” Ganduje told the BBC Hausa Service on Friday. He vowed that the brains behind the video “will be put to shame.” He did not say how. “We are making some underground plans, which we will not reveal,” he said. Asked on A Fada A Cika to confirm whether he was the person in the video, Ganduje claimed the video was doctored to show him collecting something. He added: “Even your picture can be altered to show something on your head or hand. And you know it’s possible. People always tend to believe falsehood.” To another question on whether he took dollar bribe, Ganduje said: “It is a lie. Nothing of that nature ever happened. “It was just part of a scheme to stop me from contesting election – and I contested; to stop me from winning election – and I won. “But that is not the issue, the big issue that we will deal with those behind it.” He is already in court with Daily Nigerian, which first published the videos in 2018. The governor is demanding N3billion in damages.
