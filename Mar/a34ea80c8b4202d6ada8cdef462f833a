A 19 -year-old Cybercrime kingpin, David Oritsegbeyiwa Ofoeyeno had his trial stalled on Tuesday following the transfer of the presiding judge, Justice Uche Agomoh to the Federal High Court, Ibadan. Ofoeyeno is facing a six-count charge bordering on conspiracy to commit a felony with cyber fraud, attempt to defraud, impersonation, threat to expose nudes and cyberstalking, among others. The defendants, a 300- level Student of the Media and Communication Studies department in ABUAD, was arraigned for allegedly defrauding some students of the university and other institutions, by flaunting their nude videos, which he acquired through tricks and handiworks of other syndicates. Ofoeyeno’s prosecution commenced in November 2020, after receiving litany of complaints from some students that the accused person had extorted millions of naira from them through threat that he was in possession of their nude videos and could upload such on social media platforms. At the resumed trial on Tuesday in the suit number FHC/AD/24c/2020, four witnesses, three of which were Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti (ABUAD) female students and victims of the cyber tricks as well as the Director of Students’ Affairs of the university, Mr. Wahab Babatunde were expected to testify against the suspect. When the matter, which has reached a witness stage, came up on Tuesday, Justice Agomoh announced to the court that she has been transferred to Ibadan, Oyo State Division of the Federal High Court. She said, “Let me announce to this court that I have been transferred to Ibadan Division and I have just two days more to spend here in this Judicial Division. “The Prosecution has four witnesses lined up for today (Tuesday) and if I should begin with the trial, I can’t take all the four and there would be adjournment, so it is better to adjourn this case , so probably the case can be taken over by another Judge.”
