Super Eagles Coach Gernot Rohr has challenged gangling striker Paul Onuachu to replicate his fantastic goal scoring form for RKC Genk with the Super Eagles. The 26-year-old forward has been in excellent form for his Belgian side having scored an astonishing 25 goals as the leading scorer in the on-going 20220/21 season. The former FC Ebedei starlet had once complained that his Super Eagles teammates were not playing to his striking potential hence his dry run since scoring on his debut in a pre-2019 AFCON international friendly against Egypt in Warri. But speaking ahead of the release of the Super Eagles list for the two remaining AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho, Rohr lauded Onuachu’s scoring form for Genk even as he tasked him to do more for the national team. “Of course, Onuachu is doing well and one of the best strikers in Europe presently but he has to change his mentality to score more goals for the Super Eagles,” the 67-year-olfd Rohr told NationSport. Rohr admitted that listing players in the striking positions was not an easy task with the fact that several Super Eagles’ attackers were pulling their weight with their respective European clubs. Meanwhile, the identity of the 24-man Super Eagles for the 20021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic away on March 27 and Lesotho on March 30 in Lagos may be unveiled today. As exclusively reported by NationSport, the Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa is expected to be on the list as hinted by Rohr but informed sources at the NFF confirmed last night that list might be out today. “It is true Rohr has submitted his list and I think it will likely be out on Tuesday (today) or at worst before the end of the week,” the source stated.
