 Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc has raised $650 million in debt issue, setting record as the largest bond issue by a company in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. The senior notes due 2026 were priced at a yield of 7.75 per cent, representing a significant pricing reduction from its $350 million debut issuance in 2018, which priced at a yield of 9.50 per cent , with a coupon of 9.25 per cent. Transaction report showed that the issue was oversubscribed with demand from 120 global investors from more than 20 countries resulting in a final overbook in excess of $1.1 billion, 1.7 times book coverage. The report indicated that orders came from high quality institutional investors with long term commitments to Seplat as well as new institutional investors, while the transaction was also well received in the market and traded above par post-pricing.  Seplat noted that the success of the issuance shows confidence by the international market in the Nigerian economy and the oil and gas sector in particular, with a number of the investors committing to the transaction based on the strong gas story of Seplat. The net proceeds of the new capital raising, according to the company, will be used “to redeem the existing Seplat 2023 notes, repay drawings under the revolving credit facility, for general corporate purposes, and to pay transaction fees and expenses”. The global coordinators on the transaction were Citi, J.P. Morgan, Standard Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, with Natixis, Rand Merchant Bank and Société Générale acting as joint bookrunners and FCMB Capital Markets, Nedbank, United Bank for Africa and Zenith Bank Plc acting as co-managers.
