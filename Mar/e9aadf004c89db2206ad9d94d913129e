The House of Representatives has asked the Federal Government to set up a special intervention fund for the completion of the enterprise infrastructure and application projects of the galaxy backbone. Adopting a motion sponsored Hon. Stanley Olajide Adedeji and two others on the need to complete the Enterprise Infrastructure and Application Projects of Galaxy Backbone, the House asked the Federal Executive Council to prepare a supplementary budget to cover the cost of the project. The supplementary budget is to cover Wing A and B of National Shared Service Centre building (N7, 687, 285, 769.38); Hybrid Power Solution and Backup System (N1, 031,424,555.4); DC & Cloud Solution (N7, 916, 060, 386.59) and Information security and Capacity building (N5,088,397, 180.00. Leading the debate on the motion, Olajide said that Information and Communication Technology plays a key role in national development as it enables organizations to be productive, spurring economic growth, make governments more efficient in making decision transparent and fosters social inclusion. He said further that the Galaxy Backbone was established by the Federal Government to operate a nationwide IP-based network that will provide a secure and common platform for connectivity, transmission and storage of vital information and sensitive data, as well as other infrastructure services for Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Private institutions. In line with its mandate he said, Galaxy Backbone has designed, manufactured, employed and commissioned the National Information Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Phase 1 project which controls how and where data are sent across all Ministries, Departments and Agencies within the country.
