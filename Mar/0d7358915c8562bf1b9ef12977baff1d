Karim Benzema bagged a brace as Real Madrid held on for a 3-1 win over Celta Vigo to leapfrog Barcelona into second place in the La Liga table. Having only just returned from a spell on the sidelines, there was no sign of Sergio Ramos in the starting lineup with Casemiro back after missing the midweek win over Atalanta due to suspension. It took Real Madrid 20 minutes to break the deadlock with Toni Kroos threading a perfect pass for Benzema to finish into the far corner of the net, extending his scoring run to six straight matches. And the French forward doubled his tally just 10 minutes later as Celta Vigo gave up the ball on the edge of their own area, giving goalkeeper Ivan Villar no chance of stopping Benzemaâ€™s shot.
