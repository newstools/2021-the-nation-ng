A mysterious fire on Wednesday night burnt a mother and her four children to death in Ilorin, Kwara state capital. Miraculously, one of the children in the house survived the inferno, it was gathered. The residence of the deceased is situated at Ifesowapo community, behind “F” Division police station Tanke area of the Ilorin metropolis. The fire, it was gathered, was caused by candlelight that resulted in flames and burnt the mother and children who were deep asleep into ashes. Hitherto, the neighborhoods of Tanke, Fate, and Oke-Odo areas in the metropolis had been thrown in total darkness for over a week occasioned by rainstorms that damaged electric poles in the areas. It was gathered that the father of the house was not indoors when the incident happened. The only surviving child is said to be receiving medical attention at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH).
