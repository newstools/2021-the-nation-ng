The Caretaker Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, Prince Gboyega Famodun, yesterday said the Minister for Interior, Chief Rauf Aregbesola, approved the coalition with Senator Iyiola Omisore during the 2018 election won by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. Famodun, who spoke with reporters at his residence in Ayetoro area, Osogbo, said: “ I wonder why the minister would refer to Senator Omisore as a killer and criminal, that itself is a crime. But, it is not for me to judge. “What is more surprising is the fact that we solidified the union between our party and SDP under Aregbesola as governor. And after that, we even had to replace two House of Assembly candidates from Ife Central and East state constituencies with members of SDP to further cement the relationship. “The head of our campaign office in Ile-Ife was Bashir Awotorebo, an ally of Omisore, and all of these under Aregbesola’s watch and he did not see the criminality and killer tendency in the man. So, why now”?
