Thomas Bach will be re-elected unopposed for a second term as Olympic chief this week, just five months before the opening ceremony of the coronavirus-delayed Tokyo Games and less than a year from the increasingly scrutinised 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The 67-year-old Germanâ€™s second mandate as president of the International Olympic Committee promises to be as eventful, or turbulent, as his first. The most pressing agenda item at the start of his new four-year term, after an opening eight years that saw him deal with, among other things, the problem-laden 2014 Sochi and 2016 Rio Games, state-sponsored Russian doping and the deadly wave of coronavirus, is the Tokyo Olympics. The IOC took the decision to postpone the 2020 Games for a year to July 23-August 8 during the Covid-19 pandemic.
