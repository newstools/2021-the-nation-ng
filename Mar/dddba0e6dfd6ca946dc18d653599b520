Florence Otedola, popular disc jockey and daughter of billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola, has gained admission into the prestigious Oxford University in England for a master’s degree in African Studies. The disc jockey, popularly known as DJ Cuppy, posted a video on her verified Instagram page where she told her parents about the new milestone in her academic pursuits. “Mama and Papa, I have news to share with you. Remember I applied at Oxford last year for my masters? I got it. I am going to Oxford University. I am going to Lady Margaret Hall,” she said. She seized the opportunity to ask her billionaire father if he was willing to pay her school fees, saying: “I hope papa would just pay for my school fees.” Her billionaire father, however, declined the request, saying: “I have paid for your school fees long enough. I cannot afford to.” According to another post on her Instagram page, DJ Cuppy is billed to resume on October 11, 2021 for what would be her second master’s degree, having previously bagged one in Music Business from the New York University in 2015.
