The report listed possible under remittances or over remittance against the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) as N557,852, 222,257.28 and $9,048,920,931.38 while the figure listed against the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) stood at N39,313,909.42 and $29,261,227.46. It also listed N6,995,100,228.35 against the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), N292,287,246.65 against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), $570,632,772.46 against the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and $4,138,465,740.01 against the Federal Government. It however explained that “NNPC represented that it has an outstanding claim of N797,710,684,354.00 against the federation prior to 1 January 2010. This period does not relate to our view period. Hence the legacy claim is not reflected in our figure above.”
