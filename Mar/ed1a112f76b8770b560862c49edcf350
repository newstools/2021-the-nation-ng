Former House of Representatives Speaker and 2019 Ogun Action Democratic Party (ADP) Governorship candidate, Dimeji Bankole has joined the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He met on Friday with APC chairman, Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Gov. Mai Mala Buni in Abuja in company of Jigawa Governor Abubakar Bagudu. The meeting, which took place at the APC chairman’s residence in Abuja, lasted for about an hour. Efforts to get any of the leaders to talk failed as the trio kept sealed lips but only took pictures. But a terse statement by Malam Mamman Mohammed, Director General Press Affairs to Governor Buni, confirmed the meeting. He said: “The three leaders discussed on a wide range of political issues including the movement of the former Speaker and his supporters into the party. “It is evident that APC’s opportunities in Ogun state is growing and widening.” Reacting to the development, National Chairman of ADP, Engr. Yabagi Sani, told The Nation the party was not disappointed by Bankole’s move. Sani said: “That’s a typical Nigerian politician for you. They don’t believe in building but sharing. I thought with his age and experience, he will show good example. His step is most unfortunate but we aren’t disappointed.”
