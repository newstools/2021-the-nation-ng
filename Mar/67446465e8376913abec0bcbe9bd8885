The eagerly awaited Super Eagles squad to prosecute the two remaining 2021 AFCON qualifiers matches against  Benin Republic of Benin and  Lesotho  this month may be released as early as Friday. German coach Gernot Rohr had hinted that the list may be out at least three weeks   before the away tie against Benin Republic and  NationSport learnt last night that the list might be unveiled in two days’ time. “The Super Eagles list for the games against Benin and Lesotho is ready; it will most likely be released on  Friday,” a competent source informed without giving further details. Though many new players are hopeful of  call-ups, Rohr is averse to any experimentation at this time, saying the  Super Eagles cannot afford a repeat  of their poor performance last November when they squandered  points against Sierra Leone. “We have to forget about  the mistakes we made against Sierra  Leone and we can’t make the same mistake against Benin and Lesotho,” Rohr recalled the dramatic 4-4 draw  in Benin where his wards surrendered a four-goal lead. “The choice for us is to pick the best players and I know  our players will have a strong mentality  for the matches.” Meanwhile, the Super Eagles will expectedly open training camp in Lagos on March 22 and depart for Port Novo on March 25 ahead of the qualifier against hosts Benin on Saturday, March 27 in Port Novo. The team will then welcome Lesotho in their final qualifier on March 30 at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos.
