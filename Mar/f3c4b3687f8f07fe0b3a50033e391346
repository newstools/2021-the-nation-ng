No fewer than 300 youths of Ijesha land on Tuesday sacked Chinese expatriates from five mining sites in Obokun and Atakunmonsa West Local Government Area of Osun State over land degradation. The youths, under the aegis of Omo-Ekun of Ijesha land, stormed the mining sites on bikes and directed the Chinese expatriates and labourers to leave until they are ready to attend to agitations of people of the area. The youths visited Ilase Ijesha, Iponda, Acad, Ibodi and Iberekodo. Leader of the youths, Mr Babatunde Aguntasolo, disclosed that they visited some mining sites on Monday and Tuesday to issue a vacation notice to Chinese expatriates and labourers over ‘unbearable’ land degradation. He lamented the youths and other stakeholders had held several meetings with the miners in the area over land degradation on the needs to reclaim those lands but they refused. He said: “We understand that Federal Government that gave them license to mine the mineral resources but under the mining act there is a section there that stated that they should reclaim those lands after mining. “The effect of land degradation around Owora may damage the road along Osogbo. “What the law states for miners to be doing for hosting community, they refuse to do, like community service and others.  Our youths are unemployed all those employed at the mining sites are labourers from other state and countries.  By chance, if they employ our youths they pay them less. “We will have a meeting with those that brought those Chinese expatriates here to sign an MOU to ensure the give us reasonable community development services and also employ some of the youths of the community. This will help our youths to learn about mining.”
