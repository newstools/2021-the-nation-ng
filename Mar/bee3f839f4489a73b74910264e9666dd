Suspected kidnap kingpin Usman Hassan, who escaped from Oyo State after allegedly killing an abductee, has been arrested in Ogun State. Usman and his accomplices were earlier arrested in Oyo after kidnapped and killed a farm owner at Solalu village after collecting ransom. He sneaked into Ogun for cover and allegedly recruited some Fulani men into a fresh kidnap ring which he formed in the state. It was learnt that the detectives from Ogun police Command stormed his hideout in Imala area of the state and arrested him when they got the information about his activities from those he had tried to recruit into his kidnapping enterprise. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi said Usman told detectives that he conspired with his biological brother, one Tahiru Usman, and others to kidnap their victim in Akinyele area of Ibadan and killed the victim after collecting ransom. According to him, the gang members were afraid that the victim could identify them later if he was spared.
