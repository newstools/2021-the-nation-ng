Entertainment industry players like Davido and dance queen Kaffy have lauded Nigerian music star, Oladapo ‘D’Banj’ Oyebanjo and Bankulli for settling a two-year-long social media rift. D’banj and Bankulli had a hot exchange on social media over the latter’s claim on how the former met American rapper, Kanye West, at an airport. The back and forth between the two music stars degenerated further with fans joining in the hot exchange and further drifting the erstwhile buddies further apart. However, D’Banj and Bankulli seem to have buried the hatchet to rekindle their once bloomy friendship. Earlier in the week, D’Banj and Bankulli met and broke the final straw of their rift in Accra, Ghana.  The two music entrepreneurs not only let go of their grievances to embrace peace but also shared the good news with their fans on social media. In an Instagram post, Bankulli shared a picture of himself and D’banj with the caption “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body.

Also, present on the occasion was D’Banj’s brother, Kayswitch.
