National Chairman of Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG), Mr Wale Oshun, has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s shoot-at-sight order on those bearing AK-47 is not a solution to the insecurity crisis. He feared that police might take advantage of the order to kill anyone found with a gun. According to him, the police are known for their excesses, adding that giving such a blanket order would create more crisis. “It is a delicate issue; let it not be a blanket order else the police will seize the opportunity to deal anyone find with gun. ‘’If you have a Presidential order to shoot-at-sight, they will kill anybody with a gun. I hope it won’t be another cover for police excesses?” he said. He admitted that AK-47 is not an instrument ordinary people should carry around. “Nobody has a right to carry AK-47; it is meant for security people but ordering police to shoot anyone with it is not the solution. ‘’They will just be killing people. Let the police disarm anyone with AK-47 and charge him to court. You can’t give the police the power a prosecutor, a judge and an executioner,” he said. Also speaking, Afenifere, the Pan Yoruba Social Political Group, objected to the order, saying that it reflected the carry-over of the military period. Its Public Secretary, Yinka Odumakun, said the order was unconstitutional and essentially damaging to the democratic order. He added: “We are in a democracy and shoot-at-sight is not a constitutional order. For the president to issue the order means that he is operating as a military man. ‘’The President should not adopt unconditional measures. He should follow the constitution which clearly spells out low to deal with the kind of issue.”
