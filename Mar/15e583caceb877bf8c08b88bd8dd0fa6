In 2016, those who attended the 90th birthday of Madam Patience Olutayo Obafemi, mother of Ekiti-born businessman, Otunba Peter Obafemi, attested to the display of wealth and affluence at the birthday soiree. It was grand as all that mattered most in Nigeria were in attendance. The aviation top shot, according to a source, was planning to replicate that celebration for his motherâ€™s 95th birthday in August before death visited her in February 2021. The mother went on a journey of no return, throwing Obafemi into anguish. Instead of the former gubernatorial aspirant to question God due to the attendant pain, he is thankful that He kept his mother for that long and in good health. One thing Obafemi owes his late mother now is a befitting burial ceremony and he is not leaving any stone unturned in that regard. The funeral programme is expected to kick off on April 12, 2021, with service of songs and wake keep, and on April 16, 2021 at the Ebony Vault, Ikoyi, Lagos, her final journey will begin.
