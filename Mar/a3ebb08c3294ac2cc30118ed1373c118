Without mincing words, Tina Umukoro has shown that she’s probably one of the finest and most hardworking actresses in Nollywood. Judging by her recent body of works, Umukoro has continued to prove detractors wrong that she’s undoubtedly a force to reckon with in the movie industry. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, the beautiful actress refused to rest on her oars as she released 3three movies to the admiration of her fans. The movies, Omo Honourable, Oko Asewo and Lockdown, all garnered positive reviews by critics and Nollywood stakeholders since it’s release. Umuokoro began her acting career almost 3 decades ago under the tutelage of late Nollywood veteran, Baba Sala. Shortly after appearing in several stage plays, the delectable actress left the movie industry to focus on her young family and other businesses. Due to her love for movie-making, she resurfaced in 2007 and debuted with her self produced Yoruba movie, ‘Alayapupo’ which was directed by Golugo. Her debut effort received positive reviews and its success shot her into the limelight. A decade and a half later, the versatile actress has produced dozens of movies since her debut in the make-belief industry, making her one of the consistent filmmakers in the Yoruba movie industry.
