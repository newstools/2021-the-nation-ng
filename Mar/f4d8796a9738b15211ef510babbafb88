 How cargoes traffic at the seaports have been traced to the failure of the government to fashion a policy that will support the ongoing efforts by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) in finding a lasting solution to factors inhibiting new imports Lack of clear policy by the government, lack of space and the huge number of overtime cargoes in the port have been identified by the stakeholders who spoke with The Nation in separate interviews. An analyst, Mr Felix Anderson, said the value of intra-Africa’s merchandise trade, put at $159.1 billion by the United Nations Conference on Trade (UNCTAD), should be seen as a wake-up call to the Federal Government to do something. The intra-Africa’s merchandise trade, he said, accounts for 16.1 per cent of the world trade. “Of the value, Nigeria’s contribution to intra-African trade merchandise was 6.8 per cent or 10.81 billion due to some challenges at the seaports, leaving a huge market gap to be explored,” he said. Also, a maritime lawyer, Dr Dipo Alaka, said unless the Federal Government implements some of the policies that can facilitate trade at the port, the low cargo traffic may continue till the third quarter of the year and affect the implementation of the 2021 budget. “Of 726 ships were registered under the Nigerian flag, while 400 vessels were captured by Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), 265 ships owned by Nigerians were carrying foreign flags, making the deadweight of the Nigerian owned ships with foreign flags put at 6.485million tonnes compared to those carrying Nigeria’s flag, which was put at 4.526 million tonnes. “Therefore, unless the government addresses some of the challenges facing the sector, the revenue from the port may drop significantly,’’ the don added.  NPA’s concern  Worried by the dwindling ship traffic and volume of cargoes at ports in 2020, the Managing Director Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms Hadiza Bala-Usman, said the ports had been filled with huge overtime cargoes, thereby inhibiting new imports. She said lack of deep seaports, high cost of tariff and policies of the government on some banned products had affected the ports. For example, the Managing Director said the volumes of cargo handled at the nation’s seaports dropped to 78.4 million metric tonnes in 2020 from 80.2 million metric tonnes recorded in 2019, representing a decline of 2.24 per cent. According to her, the ports also recorded a decline in ship traffic, noting that a total of 3,972 ships called in 2020 as against 4,251 in 2019. She said: “In 2020, the nation’s busiest port, Apapa Port received 632,148 Twenty Equivalent Units (TEUs) of container traffic compared to 668,672 TEUs received in 2019. For the nation’s second busiest port, Tin Can Island Port, 650,365 TEUs of containers arrived at the port in 2020 compared to 820,942 TEUs of containers in 2019. “For Onne port, 266,109 TEUs of containers arrived in 2020 compared to 247,528 TEUs in 2019. In Rivers port, 91,971 TEUs of containers arrived in 2020 compared to 71,020 TEUs in 2019. At Calabar port, 1,561TEUs of containers arrived in 2020 compared to 174 in 2019. Delta port suffered a dip in container traffic in 2020 with 1,224 TEUs compared to the 6,827 TEUs it recorded in 2019. In total, the number of container traffic that came to Nigerian ports was 1,643,378 TEUs compared to the 1,815,163 TEUs received in 2019.” Ship traffic  For some vessels, which called at the Apapa port, the managing director explained that 986 ships called last year compared to 1,034 vessels previous year, saying that at Tin Can port, 1,127 ships called in 2020, while 1,311 vessels called in 2019. Also, she explained that the ports received 3,972 ships with a Gross Registered Tonnage (GRT) of 125.13million compared to the 4,251 ships that called in 2019 with a gross tonnage of 138.57million. In terms of cargo throughput, the managing director added that the authority had 78.4 million metric tonnes in 2020, while the nation recorded 80.2 million metric tonnes in 2019. However, she stressed that the improvement in container traffic recorded at Onne Port was as a result of the deepening of the port channel and huge investment in cargo handling equipment by the West Africa Container Terminal (WACT). But the Vice-President, Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) Dr Kayode Farinto, noted that the country is overdue for a national fleet that would properly position it in the comity of maritime nations. The national fleet implementation, according to him,”is long overdue, therefore, the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi and the Director-General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) Dr Bashir Jamoh need to work with other critical stakeholders to ensure that the national fleet is restored to its past glory so that the country can be reckoned with in the comity of  nations.  Engaging the CBN  What is more is for the heads of the maritime agencies to engage the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and negotiate for one-digit interest rate for ship owners to assist in the acquisition of maritime assets; cooperating with the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board, and supporting the sector in capacity building to boost government revenue.
