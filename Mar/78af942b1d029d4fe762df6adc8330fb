Afrigrants Foundation and Money Trust Micro Finance Bank recently launched REVIVE a micro-lending scheme to support market women in Nigeria. According to the Chief Executive of Afrigrants, Ms Telma Ekiyor and Chief Business Officer of Money Trust Micro Finance Bank, Mrs. Sarah Osunsina, the goal of Revive is to support this important segment of the economy as they recover from the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme hopes to support the long term financial inclusion and economic empowerment of every market woman, especially those regarded as the main stay of the small and medium businesses in Nigeria. The two executives also disclosed that the project extends beyond loan and recovery of same. “We are not only out to give loans but to teach the women on the use of the money. This is why the project includes financial literacy training, needs assessment and profiling and assured access to consistent funding for all qualifying beneficiaries. The targeted women will have access to counseling, financial coaching and rudimentary business training as well as financial support to revive and grow their businesses, “they pointed out. The Iyaloja of Jakande Estate Market Isolo, Lagos where the project was launched expressed her happiness and those of her members on the Revive project hoping that it will go a long way to bring financial sanity to the market and other markets in Nigeria.”Individual efforts at taking loans are cumbersome, erratic and most often too demanding considering that the economy is just recovering from the adverse effect of COVID-19. We look forward to working with Afrigrant and Money Trust for effective business recovery and stability.” The Revive loan scheme which is backed up by African Development Bank is designed to spread across the nation before the end of the year.
