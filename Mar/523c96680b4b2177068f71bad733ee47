A High Court in Abeokuta, Ogun State on Tuesday sentenced a 39-year-old labourer  Mohammed Ibrahim to death by hanging for the murder of a two-year-old baby. Justice Ayokunle Rotimi-Balogun, also found the convict guilty for attempting to kill one Rabi Yakubu. Prosecuting counsel Mrs Oluwabumi Akinola told the court that on April 12, 2014 at Ofada town, Owode Egba in Abeokuta, the defendant tailed Mrs Yakubu, who was carrying her two-year-old son, to a place where she went to relieve herself in the bush. “On getting into the bush she dropped her baby on the ground for her to defecate, when Ibrahim attacked her with a knife, attempting to cut off her neck. “The complainant struggled with Ibrahim and escaped to call for help without carrying her son. When Ibrahim realised he did not succeed in cutting off her head which he needed for sale, he then cut off the complainant’s son’s head,” she said. Akinola told the court that the defendant made a confessional statement, saying that his intention was to behead the woman.
