Realtor Stephen Akintayo recently held the 2021 edition of the Upgrade Summit. Being a hybrid event, it was an opportunity for young African professionals to reiterate the need for financial freedom among youths in today’s world. The annual summit, previously known as the Upgrade Conference, was a hybrid format event, holding both virtually via social media and streaming platforms, and physically at the Oriental Hotel, Lekki, Lagos, and Marriot Hotel, Dubai UAE on Saturday, January 30. Upgrade Summit, the brainchild of Akintayo, Gtext Homes boss, is a platform where speakers come and they teach people what to do with their lives and how to make a future for themselves, and it was no different for attendees this year with the theme ‘Move Forward’.
