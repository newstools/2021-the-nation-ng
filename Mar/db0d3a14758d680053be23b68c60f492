The House of Representatives on Wednesday urged all tertiary institutions to partner to go into Public Private Partnership Contract Agreement to build hostels in Tertiary Institutions. The House urged that such agreement should be based on build and operate policy by the developers in a way that would allow them to dispose of the property to the tertiary institutions after an agreeable time. They also urged the government to pay adequate attention to the education sector, ranging from funding, curriculum review and infrastructural development. They mandated the Committee on Tertiary Education and Services to ensure implementation. The resolutions followed a motion by Olalekan Rasheed Afolabi on the parlous state of hostels on tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The House noted the deplorable state of infrastructural in Nigeria’s tertiary institutions and dilapidated hostels, roads and transportation network, non–provision of potable water, poor power supply and lack of sewage treatment facilities. They also noted that students’ academic performances are hinged, primarily on provisions of adequate learning infrastructure and basic amenities. The lawmakers observed that a demeaning environment would invariably expose students to recurrent environmental and health hazards such as cholera, dysentery, food poisoning, gastroenteritis, skin infections, frequent visits to the hospital and sometimes death. They said they were cognizant that the hostel accommodation deficit being faced by Nigeria’s higher institutions requires Public-Private Partnership (PPP) intervention, a situation that, if exploited by higher institutions, can accommodate 10% of their students. They pointed out that living in squalor reduces the self-worth of students and ultimately, the quality of output as future leaders of the society as ten or more students are sometimes officially assigned to a room meant for not more than five students.
