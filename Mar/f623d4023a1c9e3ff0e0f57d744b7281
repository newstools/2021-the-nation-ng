The Provost, Federal College of Education (Technical), Akoka, Lagos, Dr. Wahab Azeez, has said the installation of CCTV cameras around the college was to improve security, debunking claims that they were being fitted in the hostels for wrong reasons. At a briefing last Friday, Azeez said the decision to install the cameras was taken by the college’s security committee meeting following the killing of a student on campus by cultists in 2019. He said the project which was less than 50 percent complete, was being funded by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund). Azeez spoke following a protest by female students of the college Friday last week over claims that the college was installing CCTV in their hostel to monitor their activities and see their nakedness as claimed by a publication (not The Nation). He said the protest was caused by the eviction of squatters from a room in the female hostel following findings that 10 students were occupying a room meant for only five – which was against the COVID-19 protocols. He said the eviction was done at night. The Provost said: “To clear the air, it is true that some students demonstrated on Friday morning, March 5, 2021 basically to protest the ejection of some illegal female student occupants from the Independence Hall. “The CCTV project came as a result of attacks on students in the night, especially female students.” As someone who was actively involved in students and staff unionism, Azeez said he places students and staff welfare as a priority and would do nothing detrimental to their progress. Some leaders of the student Union as well as workers’ unions (COEASU, NASU and SSANIP) also debunked the claims. Students’ Union President (Degree programmes), Adewale Omotola, said  the College management had always been attentive to the needs of students. “In fairness to the management there is nothing we want that we don’t get,” he said.
