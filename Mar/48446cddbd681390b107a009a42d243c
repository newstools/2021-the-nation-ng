The Federal University  of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB) is set to tackle epileptic power supply on campus. The institution’s Director of Works and Services, Mr. Olawole Akinyele stated this in an interview with CAMPUSLIFE. As a result of power outage being faced by the university, Akinyele noted that FUNAAB was ready to install an 800kVA generating recently purchased. He said the new generator was one of the 2018 digitalised technology models, which would require in-house training for operators. “ I have discussed with the Head of Electrical  Department to give me four names of the operators that will manage it. I have to train them internally so that the generator would be able to serve the university for a long time,” he said. Akinyele added that with the new generator, the powerhouse, which had been neglected for many years, would be back to life. He praised the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Kolawole Salako,  for  activating  the powerhouse by purchasing the 800kVA generator to address constant power outage. He said : “This administration has taken the bull by the horns by activating the powerhouse. Over the years, the place has been neglected. ‘’We have a generator of 1984 edition in the power house and we have that of 2002.  But this one will go a long way to relieve  tension.” The Director said  the old generators would be repaired to serve  students in the night to elongate the life span of the new generator. He noted  that the installation would commence in due course. Akinyele advised members of staff and students to make judicious use of electricity, adding that where it was not necessary, they should not put the lights on and that all appliances should be put off at the end of working hours. He said this was necessary to manage power consumption because the electricity bills sent to the university in recent times had been outrageous.
