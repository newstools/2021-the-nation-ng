 Peugeot, the world’s oldest surviving automaker, has a brand new logo. It is the brand’s first new logo in a decade and the eleventh since 1850. Peugeot said the new visual language “reflects its bold electrification strategy and its desire to enhance the ownership experience through pioneering new technologies”. The new Peugeot logo features a new take on the Peugeot lion, with a roaring lion’s head inside a new Peugeot coat of arms. The new look will be accompanied by an international campaign and new-look website, as well as a new lifestyle collection of clothing and accessories later this year. The new logo also “showcases Peugeot as a timeless brand, celebrating its more than 210-year history, while also looking to the future, towards new technologies and innovations provided by the new Stellantis partnership”. The logo will feature across all new models, starting with the all-new Peugeot 308, which will make its world premiere later this year. Peugeot UK Managing Director Julie David, said: “A new logo and brand identity are significant developments for any marque, let alone Peugeot, who has a history spanning more than 210 years. The new logo reflects our changing model line-up and new philosophy around living in the moment, and we are very excited to showcase both the logo and the brand identity to our customers this year.” Peugeot has had ten logos since way back in 1850, and the lion has been a prominent fixture of all of them. The new logo is said to reflect the brand’s move towards more upmarket products and features a coat of arms and the powerful head of a lion. This is the first new logo that the brand has introduced since 2010.
