Gunmen have killed six family members in a settlement around Wasinmi village, Ikire in Irewole Local Government Area along Ife/Ibadan expressway at the early hours of Sunday. The gunmen invaded the village and shot the six members of the family dead. One person sustained bullet injury following the attack. A source told THE NATION the gunmen started shooting at members of the family. He said he suspected that the attack was a retaliation of animosity. “We are yet to know the identity of those that attacked the family because after they carried out the dastard act, they ran away before the arrival of security operatives,” the source said. Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode, led security operatives to the village to prevent further attacks. Deputy Governor Benedict Alabi also visited the village to console with the family. Spokesperson of the Osun Police Command, Mrs. Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the incident. She noted that the attack was not connected to any clash between farmers and herders as speculated by some people. She said in a statement: “The preliminary investigations by the Police reveal that some yet to be identified gunmen, stormed, attacked and shot sporadically at a family of six at a settlement in the outskirts of Wasinmi Village, Ikire, Osun State, leaving one person injured. “Police Operatives from Ikire Division and other law enforcement agencies were promptly drafted to the scene to prevent further attacks on residents in the area and arrest the perpetrators but the attackers escaped on sighting the security team. “The CP appeals to the people of the State, particularly residents of Ikire and its environs not to panic but collaborate with the Police by giving timely information that will assist in arresting the culprits.” Alabi condemned the killing of the family of six and ordered immediate manhunt of the assailants. Alabi described the killing as disheartening and unfortunate because Osun is a peaceful state.
