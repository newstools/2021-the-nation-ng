Die-hard fans of ex-BBNaija housemate of Erica Ngozi Elewedim, popularly known as Erica or Star girl, have erected a massive billboard at Alexander roundabout in Ikoyi, Lagos ahead of her 27th birthday. They had engaged in a war of words with other fans of ex- BBNaija housemates especially with the ninjas and icons a few days ago. They vowed that they would celebrate her in a manner that is yet to have been experienced by any housemate ever. The massive billboard captures the face of Erica with an advert ahead of her birthday tomorrow.
