A 33,000-litre fuel-laden tanker was gutted by fire while exiting a filling station in Akute Ajuwon. LASEMA said the cause of the fire could not be ascertained. The fire destroyed the AGO pump machine, electric pole and cables before it was put out by the Lagos and Federal Fire services and other responders. Dr Oke-Osanyintolu said there was no loss of life and none sustained injury. Also, a section of Owode Onirin Market on Ikorodu Road was razed by fire on Saturday night. LASEMA said it received distress calls around 11pm. The agency said: “On arrival at the scene, it was discovered that the section of the market selling spare parts was ablaze. A combined team of the agency firefighters and the Lagos State Fire Service battled through the night to curtail the fire. “Initial post-disaster assessment indicated that extensive property damage has occurred with yet to be confirmed number of shops directly affected. The operation was concluded at around 5am on Sunday.”
