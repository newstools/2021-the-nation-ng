Deborah Oluwaseyi Joshua, popularly known as Seyi Shay has revealed in a chat with Hip Tv her plans to take up more acting roles. She spoke after she attempted to carve a place for herself in Nollywood with the movie “Lara and the Beats” where she played the lead role and featured alongside top acts. She later said in 2018 she will not be taking up any movie roles again because it was so long and tiring. She had explained, “the longest you do is six to eight hours to shoot a music video but shooting the movie took over a month to do.” However, the story seems to have changed as the “right now” crooner recently communicated her intention to get more involved in acting. Seyi Shay acknowledged and commended the feats of Nollywood actors and how they are steadily breaking into Hollywood.
