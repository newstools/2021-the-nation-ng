Prince Udofia, the erstwhile team coordinator of  the national U-17 team that won the FIFA U-17 World Cup at Chile 2015, recently created his own story by  leading  Nationwide  League one side, JM Liberty of Makurdi, to the  Pro-League. Udofia, a  coaching graduate  from the National Institute of Sports (NIS) as well as holder of  CAF Intermediary Coaching Certificate,  was the cynosure of all eyes  with the Makurdi-based  side at the NLO play-off centre  in Jos at the Rwang Pam Township Stadium . His side won all its six matches to secure promotion  to the NNL  in only  their  first attempt.  “I  want to  thank  the Almighty God for the privilege of winning this slot not just for the good people of Benue state alone but for the entire North Central which comprises  of Plateau state, Benue state, Nasarawa state, Niger State , Kogi State amongst others,” Udofia, a graduate of  Hungarian University of Physical education  in Budapest told The Nation. “My special thanks goes to  the  President of JM Liberty  FC ASP Jeremiah Avugul for believing in my technical prowess and administrative acumen as well as His Excellency Governor Samuel Ortom for giving the state a new team under his tenure. “ Above all, my players  for sacrificing so much and following my instructions to the letter.” In a related development, Governor Ortom has congratulated the management and players of JM Liberty Football Team on their promotion to  the  NNL  also known as professional league.
