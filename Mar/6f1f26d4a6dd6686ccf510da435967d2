General Manager Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) Olajide Oduyoye has condemned the unwarranted murder of an officer of the agency, Obasu Segun Godwin and the assault on another officer, Adeniyi Hakeem, by operator of a Suzuki commercial bus otherwise known as ‘korope’ and others at Anthony area of Lagos State on Tuesday, 16th March, 2021. Oduyoye explained the operatives were attacked with machetes and other dangerous weapons by the driver of a commercial bus with registration number FKJ 452 YC, plying Bariga to Oshodi via the Ikorodu road axis in cohort with some other drivers, after his vehicle was apprehended for contravening the Traffic Law of the State. He said: “Obazu was struck severally with machetes resulting in deep lacerations on the head and his eventual death while Adeniyi Hakeem, who was also attacked in a similar fashion has been hospitalised and in a coma”. While noting some senior officers, who were also in mufti and around the area were lucky to escape the mob attack, the General Manager warned all cultists doubling as commercial bus drivers any traffic violation or infraction shall be punished or penalised as enacted by the Lagos State House of Assembly. Oduyoye noted that seven of the culprits have been caught and handed over to the police while the driver of the bus and others are still at large.
