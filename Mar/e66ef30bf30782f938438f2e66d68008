Turkey has pulled out of a landmark European treaty aimed at protecting women from violence, despite rising domestic abuse and the country’s high femicide rate. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a decree early on Saturday morning annulling Turkey’s ratification of the Istanbul Convention, which is designed to promote equality and obliges state authorities to prevent violence against women, protect survivors and prosecute perpetrators. Turkey was the first country to sign the Council of Europe accord in 2011 and the law came into force in 2014. No reason was given for the withdrawal, but officials in the ruling AK Party said last year the government was considering pulling out amid a row over how to curb growing violence against women. “The guarantee of women’s rights are the current regulations in our bylaws, primarily our constitution. Our judicial system is dynamic and strong enough to implement new regulations as needed,” Zehra Zumrut Selcuk, the family, labour and social policies minister, said on Twitter. (www.newsnow.co.uk)
