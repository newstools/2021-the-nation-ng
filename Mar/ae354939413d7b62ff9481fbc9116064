The Sector ‘C’ Surveillance and Enforcement Team of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) in Delta State  is sustaining the war on pipeline vandalism. Led by ex-militant leader Eshanekpe Israel aka Akpodoro, the team is collaborating with men of Operation Delta Safe (OPDS) of Sector 1 Command in Effurun Barracks. The team destroyed over 10,000 litres of petroleum products on Friday. The media office of IPMAN said the development followed intelligence that led the team to Mackaiva in Ogbe Ijaw area of Warri South-West Local Government. Mackaiva is said to be home to product adulterators and economic saboteurs, who have been plying their trade undisturbed for ages.  But they have met their end, as the Akpodoro-led surveillance team and security agencies have vowed to stop the economic saboteurs by tackling pipeline vandals. According to a statement, on receiving intelligence report about Mackaiva, the IPMAN team stormed the area. On sighting the team, the illicit traders ran away, leaving the operatives to destroy already loaded drums of illegal products. Akpodoro said since his team began operations, it had identified many spots where illegal oil bunkerers carry out their activities. He vowed to visit such places with his team soon.
