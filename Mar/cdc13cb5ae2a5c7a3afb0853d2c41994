A political pressure group, the Vision for a Better, Progressive, and United Nigeria, has outlined the benefits the All Progressives Congress (APC) stands to harness if Ali Modu Sheriff emerges National Chairman of the party. The group submitted that the former Borno State governor has massive experience in party administration, adding that the fact that he was once the National Chairman of the main opposition party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), puts him strategically ahead of others. It argued that Sheriff has the spread and goodwill to lead the APC to victory in the 2023 Presidential election. National Coordinator of the group, Comrade Peter Akubuo, in a statement in Abuja, Wednesday, urged the APC to zone the slot of the National Chairman to the Northeast to pave way for Sherrif to contest. According to the statement, “we as a pressure group within the APC are appealing to the former Borno governor (Sheriff) to contest for the office of the National Chairman of our great party. We have no doubt that his leadership will strengthen the APC and reposition it for the 2023 general elections.” The statement added further that, “APC at this time needs a strong and experienced leader like Sheriff. The fact that he was once the National Chairman of the PDP puts him at a great advantage. It will mean that the major opposition party will collapse into the APC.”
