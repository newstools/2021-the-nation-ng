Liverpool legend Steve McManaman said he is doubtful over whether the club would be able to afford a move for Kylian Mbappe. The Paris Saint-Germain forward is regarded as arguably the best young player in the world. And the 22-year-old has hit the headlines again recently with a superb four goals over the two legs of his side’s Champions League win against Barcelona. Mbappe’s future has been the source of much speculation, with the Frenchman still yet to sign an extension to his current deal, which expires in June 2022.  Liverpool has been touted as one potential destination, with Mbappe himself known to be a big fan of the Reds. But speaking to Horseracing.net, McManaman admitted that he cannot see the transfer taking place any time soon.  “I personally don’t think it will happen,” McManaman said. “I think if you look at the numbers, I don’t think Liverpool could do those types of numbers. Maybe in a couple of years. “Let’s be honest he would cost too much money. At least £200million. He’d break Neymar’s record as the most expensive player. “I presume he would want around £400,000 a week, I personally don’t think you can do it.” However, McManaman believes that the door would not be closed for Mbappe to make the switch to Anfield at some point in the future. He continued: “Don’t get me wrong, I think he’s the most incredible footballer and I’d take him in a heartbeat because he’s that good and he gives you that lift. “Liverpool are an incredibly famous team, one of the most well-supported across the world. “He’s not going to make you jump sufficiently higher that you think you’re going to get it back on image rights etc. You’d get some back but the numbers won’t add up for Liverpool.
