The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that achieving Nigeria’s target to diagnose and treat one million tuberculosis (TB) cases by 2022 is very feasible. The Country Representative of the WHO, Dr Walter Mulombo, who was represented by Dr Amos Omoniyi, said this in Abuja, during a virtual Pre-World TB Day press briefing. He said: “I like to congratulate the TB program in Nigeria for the progress they made. Despite the pandemic in the year 2020 and the 3-month lockdown, the TB program in Nigeria recorded an increase in the number of cases detected. Last year, which was the year of the pandemic happened to be the year they had the highest number detected TB cases. We see the number increase from over 120,266 in 2019 to 138,573 in 2020. This means that we are on the right path.” The National Coordinator of the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP), Dr Chukwuma Anyike, said: “We have also noticed that resistant cases of tuberculosis are increasing and our children are not spared. How can we move forward in terms of development as a nation if our children are affected? “This is a call to everyone – academia, civil Society, partners etc., to improve on our concerted efforts. It is also very important since our health system is based on primary health care and is also on the concurrent list. Therefore, I expect that while we are doing it here, the state and local government players and the private sector will play their part.” The Board Vice-Chair of Stop TB Partnership Nigeria, Dr. Queen Ogbuji, added: “Now more than ever we need to double efforts to increase awareness about TB and mobilise the very needed resources so that we can achieve the UN high-level mission target for 2022.” The Executive Director, KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation Nigeria, Dr Bethrand Odume, stated that KNCV works directly with the TB programs, and has programs running in 14 states, with 187 platforms used in testing for TB and covid-19.
