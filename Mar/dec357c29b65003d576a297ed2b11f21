A school principal in Benue State has been removed on reports of brutalising a student. Father John Asen, principal of Mt St Gabriel’s Secondary School, Makurdi, was directed to proceed on administrative leave immediately after pictures of apparent brutality of a student of the school trended on social media. One of the pictures showed many whiplashes on a student’s back. Fr Ansen was alleged to have inflicted those marks. The Catholic Bishop of Makurdi Diocese and proprietor of all Catholic schools in the diocese Most Revd Wilfred Chikpa Anagbe, who removed the principal, has also approved his replacement with Mr. Philip Ahembe as acting principal of the school. Until his elevation, Ahembe was the Vice Principal, Academics of the school. Parents of the student petitioned the Catholic Bishop on the development, following which an investigation was launched into the matter. Ansen’s removal resulted from the initial findings of the investigative panel.
