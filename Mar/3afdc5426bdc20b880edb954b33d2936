Articulated vehicle drivers protesting the alleged killing of two of their members by suspected herdsmen yesterday barricaded the Benin-Ore Expressway at Ofosu, the boundary between Edo and Ondo states. The incident triggered a gridlock. It was gathered that the two truck drivers were killed on Tuesday night.  It was also learnt that the killers made away with undisclosed sums of money from their victims. The aggrieved drivers, at press time, insisted that Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki must come from Benin to address them. They said that would be the only condition to remove the barricade from the strategic road.
