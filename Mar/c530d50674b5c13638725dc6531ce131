The General Council (Board) of the Musical Copyright Society Nigeria Ltd/Gte (MCSN) has appointed Dr. Sunday Adeniyi Adegeye, MFR aka King Sunny Ade as the Honorary President of the Society. The appointment of KSA as the President of MCSN coincides with the going live of the Society’s GoCreate App for the monitoring and reporting of the use of music on all platforms (digital, online, and offline) within Nigeria’s territory. King Sunny Ade was a past Chairman of the Board of the Society during the turbulent period when MCSN was struggling to be approved or licensed as a collecting society (now Collective Management Organisation). As Chairman, KSA led several delegations of MCSN to meet with Ministers and top Government functionaries to press for the recognition of MCSN as a collecting society. KSA also led MCSN through a series of serious legal battles for the respect and defence of the rights musicians. In his new role, the King of World Beat is expected to act as the Ambassador Plenipotentiary of the Society opening more doors of opportunities for the society by leveraging on his wide experience and contacts around the world for the benefit of the society and its affiliates. MCSN is also expected to leverage the vast experience and network of King Sunny Ade in pushing the cause of society. Speaking about these two important developments, the Chief Executive Officer of MCSN, Mayo Ayilaran, stated that the potentials of MCSN are gradually being revealed to the Nigerian Music and entertainment industry, particularly the creative sector. With time, the locust years of the Nigerian music industry would certainly be fully restored.
