Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Idris Ahmed Wase said on Monday that the House will pay special attention to the issue of Local Government Reform, Electoral Reform and Judicial reform in the process of amending the 1999 constitution. Speaking at a retreat for members of the House Adhoc Committee on Constitution Review, Wase said it was evident that the country was passing through serious challenges as a result of the local government system not working as it should and therefore need special attention from the lawmakers. Wase also said that the House may pay attention to the issue of state creation as well as other agitations by various groups in the country. He said the lawmakers have the opportunity to write their names in gold by ensuring that they do everything possible to give Nigerians a people-oriented constitution, stressing that electoral review was particularly important to give Nigerians a direction in its democratic growth. Wase who is also the Chairman of the Constitution Review Committee of the House said the issue of state creation as well as women participation will also be given special attention by the House Committee. He said “this is about our nation-building. We have the opportunity to write names in gold. Whatever we are going to do here, we should be guided by the fact that Nigeria needs very critical reforms at this very particular moment and time. “By our own design at the secretariat, we thought we should segment the issues in the country so that we will have them in batches. We are not going to have one batch constitutional review like it is done in the past. As the issues come, we shall be treating them and we have classified the issues.”
