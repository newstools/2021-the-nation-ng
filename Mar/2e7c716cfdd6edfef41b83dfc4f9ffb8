Chief Executive Officer of Huntella, Bankole Dada, has stated engaging in Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) is one of the core mandates the firm. He stated this at a campus event in Lagos where he was guest speaker of the Students’Union Government. According to him: “I like to talk to the youths because I am one of them. The youths are my primary constituency, because I relate with them, irrespective of class or race. “I see myself being privileged to talk with the future generations in Nigeria. We can take this country by storm, in our different fields of endeavours. “We cannot all be politicians, that is why we must strive to hit it big genuinely in what we know how to do. “Eleven years of consistency in sales has been rewarding. I believe that youths can do well if given the right opportunities. “But the society we find ourselves today, does not bring opportunities to you, you have to create it. Huntella has brought respite to those with meagre resources, because we believe we can reach the unreachable.”
