Steven Gerrard may have to turn to Nathan Patterson once again after the Ibrox boss admitted make-shift right-back Leon Balogun is struggling ahead of their visit to Livingston. The Ibrox men head to West Lothian knowing they are close to securing their first title in a decade but with captain James Tavernier also out with injury, the manager has a decision to make on his right flank. Tavernier was ruled out for up to three weeks after he limped off during the Light Blues’ first leg Europa League clash with Royal Antwerp. Balogun replaced him and has looked solid but was replaced at half-time in the return leg at Ibrox last week and Gerrard admits he is looking unlikely to make the Lions game. He said: “Leon Balogun is struggling for tomorrow he’s got a niggle in the quad muscle that he came off the game with, he’s a big doubt for tomorrow for sure.”
