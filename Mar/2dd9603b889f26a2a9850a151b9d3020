Four members of a family have died in a late-night inferno that occurred on Monday in Bida local government area of Niger state. The inferno which was said to have been caused by an electrical fault razed down the building where the family were living. The Monday night incident killed the two wives, Hajiya Salamatu and Hajiya Jummai Kabaraini and two grandchildren of the owner of the building, Alhaji Ahmadu Kabaraini who is also said to be late. The names of the grandchildren are Hauwa and Khairatu Mahmud kabaraini. Nobody could say how the fire began but a neighbour said that by the time they noticed, the inferno had burnt a large part of the house and there was no way to save the family because of the burglary proof windows fixed around the house. All valuables in the house were all burnt down in the fire. The head of the family, Alhaji Sallau Kabaraini who bemoaned the misfortune faced by the family noted that it is a great loss to the family. He described the two wives as virtuous women who seek peace at every time adding that despite their husband was deceased; they still brought up the children in a good way. Condoling the family, the Etsu Nupe who is the Chairman of the State Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar urged the family to see the incident as an act of God.
