 The All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Edo State chapters, are engaging in war of words over Tuesday’s demolition of the Government Reservation Area (GRA), Benin houses of three chieftains of the main opposition, APC, in the South-south state. PDP fired the first salvo yesterday, through its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, by accusing APC leaders of mindless, reckless and absurd allocation and conversion of government property and assets to private use by the administration of a former Edo Governor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who later became the National Chairman of the party (APC). Edo APC, through its Publicity Secretary, Chris Azebamwan, in its response, titled: “PDP is Playing Ostrich,” accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of the PDP of double standard and vindictiveness, especially for approving the demolished buildings and plots’ Certificates of Occupancy (C of Os), as Chairman of the Economic Team in Oshiomhole’s government for almost eight years. Obaseki’s bulldozer, accompanied by soldiers, riot policemen and personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), on Tuesday, demolished the house of Edo’s immediate past Deputy Governor, Dr. Pius Odubu, a frontline leader of APC, near Government House, Benin.
