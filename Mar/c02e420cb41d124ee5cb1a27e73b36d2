The Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Mr. Olukayode Popoola, has said the Federal Government had postponed the plan to partially close for repairs the Falomo Bridge which links Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Popoola told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on telephone on Sunday that the decision to suspend the repairs was reached after a meeting with relevant stakeholders. “After consultations with relevant stakeholders, we decided to postpone the rehabilitation work. A new date will be announced soon for the partial closure and commencement of repair works,” he said. Popoola apologised to road users and members of the public for any inconvenience caused by the shift in date for the repairs. NAN reports that Popoola had, in a statement on Friday night, announced a plan to partially close the Falamo Bridge for a six-week rehabilitation work.
