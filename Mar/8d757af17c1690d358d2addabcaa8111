Mobile broadband penetration declined by three per cent due to Federal Government’s policy that banned activation of new Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards. The Federal Government has also given marching orders to infrastructure companies (Infracos) licensed by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to start the roll-out of optic fibre cables (OFC) in both rural and urban areas while their counterpart cash backing is being prepared. Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof Garba Dambatta, who spoke weekend at a forum tagged: Virtual structured engagement with key stakeholders in the Nigerian telecoms and information communication technology (ICT)  sector on the new  National Broadband Plan  (NBP) 2020-2025, organised by the Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) blamed the marginal plunge in mobile broadband in the country on the directive suspending the activation of new SIM cards pending when the streamlining of existing subscribers must have been completed over rising insecurity across the country. Dmabatta stressed the need for collaboration among stakeholders, adding that some successes have been recorded in the collaboration with Governors’ Forum in the area of streamlining the payment of Right of Way (RoW) charges, much more still needed to be done to achieve the rather ambitious 70 per cent target. He also hinted that the Commission would partner with the Nigerian Communications Satellites Limited (NigComSat) with a view to freeing up spectrum in the 400megahertz (MHz) band for Next Generation Network deployment in the near future. Represented by the Director, Digital Economy at the NCC, Dr Austine Nwaulune, the nation’s telecoms chief regulator said it was heartwarming that the Commission has achieved consolidation in the area of spectrum availability with the finalisation of Spectrum Trading Guidelines. “Some of the targets of the NNBP 2020-2025 include, achieving 15Mbps and 25Mbps internet speed in rural and urban areas respectively by 2025, interconnection of 90per cent of all Local Government Areas by fibre, 70 per cent population penetration, 100 per cent of tertiary institutions to be within 5Km of a fibre  Point of Access (PoA), 60per cent of all telecom towers to be connected by fibre, connection of one major hospital or general hospital per LGA via fibre, reduction of average cost of data to N390/Gb or less and establishment of at least one local assembly or manufacture of smart devices, and reduction of RoW to N145/m, “ Dambatta said. He said it was obvious that the government, the industry and other stakeholders would need to aggregate their potentials and expertise to achieve these targets. The NNBP 2020-2025 has raised the performance bar for the whole telecom industry, however being a document crafted by experts and executives, there is no reason why it cannot be achieved to put Nigeria in a firm pedestal of nations with broadband access, the EVC said. He assured the stakeholders that the Commission would continue to take proactive measures  in providing the necessary regulatory interventions which will facilitate the achievement of not only the 70per cent broadband penetration target, but other associated targets for the transformation of the industry. In his welcome address, ATCON President, Ikechukwu Nnamani, the event was organised to have a conversation around the New National Broadband Plan 2020-2025 with a view to ascertaining the status of the implementation, identifying any bottlenecks to successful implementation that may still exist, and proffering lasting solutions to issues that are likely to constitute an obstacle to the eventual realisation of the 70 per cent penetration target.
