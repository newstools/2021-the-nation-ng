The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has stated it has not taken any decision on zoning ahead of the 2023 general elections. It said it was yet to consider recommendations of a committee chaired by Bauchi Governor Bala Mohammed on zoning. The committee had urged the PDP to base its consideration for the ticket on merit rather than zoning it to any geopolitical zone. The recommendation sparked controversy among party chieftains and stakeholders, particularly from the southern parts of the country who have been clamouring for the ticket to be zoned to the south. But in a statement on Tuesday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said it has not taken any decision on any of the recommendations contained in the report The statement said: “The PDP notes that the recommendations will be subjected to its democratic process by relevant organs of the party and consultation across all national interests. “While our party appreciates the enthusiasm by Nigerians on our nomination processes, the PDP assures that its decision on zoning will be the product of wide consultation, discussions and consensus building, taking into consideration the aggregate aspiration and hope of the generality of the Nigerian people. “Our party has however noted the disposition and line of discussion from various political interests across the six geo-political zones of our country in this regard, and at the appropriate time, the collective understanding of Nigerians will prevail”.
