Former Minister of State for Works, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, has assured Nigeria will work again under the visionary leadership of National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu. Adeyeye spoke during the inauguration of Akwa Ibom Stakeholders for Asiwaju Tinubu ( AKISAT) 2023, a volunteer-oriented political support group over the weekend in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital. He said the current situation facing Nigeria does not need a green horn politician with no capacity and feasible blueprint to redeem the nation. Adeyeye revealed many political movements with members in the 36 states have begun massive support for the emergence of former Lagos Governor as presidential candidate for 2023 elections. He said: “Nigeria currently is facing a lot of challenges. I believe the challenges were are facing now have never been faced before since independence. “Today, there is problem of insecurity in the whole country, economy is not being as we expected and population is growing at a geometrical progression. “There is also issue of ethic tension arising from insecurity by herdsmen attack. “At this time Nigeria only needs Asiwaju Tinubu. In his time as Lagos state governor, staff salaries, developmental projects, philanthropic activities never stopped even when the then president refused to give allocation to the state. “Think about it, if he did that in Lagos and we never heard Lagos State going into recession at the time, what if he had the whole country struggling to manage her abundant resources? Let us ponder upon that.”
