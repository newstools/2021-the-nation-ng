An Akure High Court has sentenced one Kolawole Apoti to life imprisonment for having sex with his teenage niece and three others. His niece was said to have lured other teenage girls to his house where he forcefully had sex with them and gave them N100 afterwards. The convict was said to have been having sex with the niece for a long time before she started luring other victims to him. All the victims are students of a secondary school in Akure. Bubble burst for Kolawole when the girls engaged in a fight over the money he gave to one of them and the school principal got wind of their escapades. One of the victims in her statement during trial said, “The man struggled with me to remove my pant. He slept on me and penetrated into my private part. Something like water came out which he used red cloth to clean up. Thereafter, the man gave me N100 and warned me not to tell my parent otherwise I would die. I forgot a pair of my stock in his room. When I went back for it, he slept with me again.” The prosecution led by Bunmi Koyenikan called four witnesses including Vice Principal, Administration in the course of trial. The girls said they did not tell their parents that they were raped over fear of death threat by the accused person. Kolawole who denied the allegation of unlawful sexual intercourse said the girls consented to the sexual intercourse after which he gave them money. But the court held that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant raped the girls who are children. Trial judge, Justice Olutoyin Akeredolu, found him guilty as charged and sentenced Kolawole to life imprisonment.
