Politician and publisher of online news platform, Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, was accompanied to the Magistrates’ Court in Wuse Zone 2, Abuja, on Tuesday by a man in a red and black striped sleeveless knee-length dress and a matching cap. The man, who did not reveal his name, was among Sowore’s supporters who were in court to witness proceedings in his trial, along with four others, on a three-count charge bordering on conspiracy, unlawful assembly and incitement. The man was described as Sowore’s spiritual advisor. His dress had cowries, snail shells and the small head of a fox emblazoned on it. He carried a guard and a small horsetail with cowries in his right hand; a red cloth sack was strapped to his shoulder. The man had chalk marks round his eyes. He was barefooted. His appearance caused curious glances among the people around the court premises.  Like, others, who were with Sowore, the man, who looked like a seer character in an Igbo movie, was also allowed into the courtroom. During proceedings, a prosecution witness, police official, gave evidence about how the defendants were apprehended in the early hours of January 1, 2021 while allegedly engaging unlawful assembly and inciting public disturbance. The witness said the defendants were arrested by a team of policemen at the Lokogoma junction in Abuja. While being cross-examined by lawyer to the defendants, Marshal Abubakar, the witness said he did not personally arrest Sowore, but that he was a member of the team that effected the arrest of all the defendants. Before adjourning further proceedings till May 7 this year, Chief Magistrate Mabel Segun-Bello, varied the conditions attached to the bail earlier granted to the second to fifth defendants by granting them permission to travel outside Abuja until the next adjourned date.
