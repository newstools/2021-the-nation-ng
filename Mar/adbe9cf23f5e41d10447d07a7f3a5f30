  No fewer than 19 commuters have died and 34 others injured in an auto crash on the Kaduna-Abuja Highway. The crash occurred on Sunday in the Kateri area of the expressway. Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said the accident happened when the tyre of a speeding DAF trailer exploded. “Security agencies have reported that 19 people died in a ghastly road traffic crash at the Kateri axis of the Kaduna-Abuja highway on Sunday,” Aruwan said. “According to the report, the crash, which occurred late on Sunday evening, involved a commercial DAF trailer and was caused by a combination of speeding, and an exploding tyre, leading to a loss of control, which caused the vehicle to veer into the bush. “A total of 53 people were involved in the crash; 16 of these died on the spot, with three others later confirmed dead. Thirty-four (34) sustained injuries which ranged from bruises and cuts to dislocations and head injuries. They were evacuated from the scene by personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps. “The survivors are receiving treatment in hospital.”
