The member representing Gwaram Federal Constituency of Jigawa, Hon. Yuguda Kila, is dead. The 70-year-old died at the National Hospital from an undisclosed illness. He was chairman of the House Committee on Customs and Excise. His deputy in the House Committee on Customs and Excise, Hon. Leke Abejide, had informed members and officials of the Nigeria Customs Service earlier in the day the chairman was indisposed, while asking for prayers for his quick recovery. Controller General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd.), who appeared before the committee to defend the 2021 budget estimate of the Service, offered prayers for Kila’s quick recovery. However, news of his death later filtered into the venue about three hours later, forcing the committee to adjourn abruptly. House Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, who later spoke to journalists, said: “The man was admitted last two weeks for just severe malaria. ‘’It later degenerated into acute shortage of oxygen in his blood stream. He tested negative to COVID-19 about three times and till he gave up (the ghost) this afternoon, he was confirmed not COVID-19 infected. “Myself and the Speaker are still at the National Hospital. We have secured release of his remains and completed arrangements for an Air Force aircraft to convey his body to Kano for Islamic funeral.”
