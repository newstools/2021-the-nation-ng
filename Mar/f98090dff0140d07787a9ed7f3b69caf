Social media have called out former BBNaija housemate Tolani Shobajo popularly known as Tbaj for describing a Twitter user @glitzy_cynthia1as razz. The media personality who mistook the tweet by the female Twitter user as a sub meant for her did not waste any time in bad-mouthing the young lady. @glitzy_cynthia1 had tweeted: “Nah tbag is messy af.” The young lady made a tweet about Robert Lyle Knepper, who played Tbag, the controversial and cruel character in the epic American television series, “Prison Break.” Tbaj most likely didn’t take her time to check the name on the tweet as she immediately snapped. She quoted the young lady’s tweet with her picture and retweeted: “See how Razz you look. Keep your mouth shut.” Twitter users returned the favour by striking back at the ex-BBNaija housemate. @SMiTHiE__ tweeted: “One girl (Cynthia) was on her own when she tweeted… “Nah tbag is messy af” Tolanibaj came from nowhere and quoted the tweet with Cynthias picture saying… “See how Razz you look. Keep your mouth shut” TwitterNg dragged Tbaj and did new naming ceremony for her. @a_vanita tweeted: “Lmaoo! I love that people are telling Tbaj that the girl she called razz is finer than her.” @Irunnia_ said: “The babe is beautiful. Tbaj you sef be beautiful if you think it’s easy.” @erica_my_focus2 tweeted: “Isn’t she the same girl who served indomie from the sink during that indomie challenge task and even ate it? And she is calling someone razz.” @Day_veed tweeted: “She was talking about tbag in prison break not Tbaj, Eba don cover this stan eyes.”
