The Lagos State Government will close down Abule Nla and Brewery Level Crossings for the construction of track laying of the Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge from 9:30pm on, Friday 12th March, to 6:00am Saturday 13th March, 2021. A statement from the Ministry of Transportation disclosed that the contractor China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Nigeria Limited, would commence the track stress dispersion on the level crossings, hence the need for the closure. As a result of the ongoing construction on the aforementioned routes, the Costain Bridge will be opened to all motorists to serve as alternative route to aid movements of people around the corridor. Road users are therefore advised to comply with the Stateâ€™s Traffic Management Personnel directions and road signals to minimise inconveniences that may be experienced while the construction work lasts. The state government appealed to residents, especially motorists that ply these corridors to bear the pains, as the project is aimed at achieving a seamless Multi Modal Transport System that will meet the transportation needs of a larger population.
