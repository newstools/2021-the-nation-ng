The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has questioned President Muhammadu Buhari’s medical trip to the United Kingdom. HURIWA described as “shameful and regrettable the decision of Buhari to continue to travel to London at serious costs to the taxpayers to take care of his personal health needs”. The group said the choice of Buhari to patronise foreign health service providers in total rejection and disregard for indigenous health service professionals has shown his administration is hypocritical about achieving any kinds of mileage in rebuilding the near moribund health care sector of the economy. “This constant medical tourism by the political class and especially by President Muhammadu Buhari shows that he does not mean well for the health care system in Nigeria and also demonstrates a lack of sensitivity to the health needs of millions of Nigerians who most times die from seemingly treatable diseases due to the collapse of public health care infrastructures all across the country,” HURIWA said in a statement jointly signed on Tuesday by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf. It emphasised the frequent medical tourism of the President showed the Federal Ministry of Health right under the purview of Buhari is simply “gambling with the lives of millions of Nigeria’s since the President of the country and the appointing authority of the federal cabinet has nothing in stock on how to revive health care infrastructures”.
