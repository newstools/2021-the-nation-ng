National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Tinubu has described Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu as a worthy leader who has justified the mandate given to him. He spoke on Friday at the opening of the Pen Cinema flyover in Agege Local Government Area. According to Tinubu, Sanwo-Olu was presented as the party’s governorship candidate due to the failure of the previous administration. He said: “Sometime in 2017/2018, the ship of this state seemed to have headed in the very wrong direction. History has it that we came together during election and chose a democratic candidate and government. “They asked who Babajide Sanwo-Olu was, and we answered them that you will soon find out. “Since Babajide became Sanwo-Olu the captain, the captain of the ship of our state, he has turned it to the right direction for progress, development and good leadership qualities. “Both Sanwo-Olu and Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat and the executive members, have demonstrated unequal determination to redevelop and rebuild, for the people of Lagos State, a fine and determined united government for the progress and quality of life of our people. “Thank you for not letting us down. You have shown today that we have you exclusively. “We have a team led by Sanwo-Olu, partnered by Hamzat, building Lagos back to progress to showcase that where a steady hand and mind is, and no matter the economic turbulence, you will always steady the ship and make progress, and bring prosperity out of adversity. “Instead of showing demonstration of frustration, you put your hand on the plough and not looked back since then, and Lagos has become one giant construction site. “We thank you for not letting us down, for being who you are and what we believe you are since the beginning of this administration and before your election.”
