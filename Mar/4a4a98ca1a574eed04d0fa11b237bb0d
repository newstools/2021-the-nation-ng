Executive Secretary of the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), Dr. Hamid Bobboyi, has said the 36 states as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have not accessed about N41.06 billion funds with the commission. States are expected to provide 50 per cent matching grant before they can access funds from the commission to develop basic education. Bobboyi announced this when members of the Senate Committee on Basic and Secondary Education visited the commission Thursday in Abuja. The UBEC boss said the states and the FCT accessed about N143 billion matching grant from 2017 to 2020, out of the N184.8 billion from the Federal Government. He said no state had accessed the 2020 matching grant, while Ogun State was yet to access its 2018 allocations. According to him, 10 states have also not taken delivery of their 2019 grants as of March 8, 2020. Bobboyi listed the states to include Kebbi, Niger, Ogun, Enugu, Anambra, Ebonyi, Imo, Edo, Abia and Lagos, adding that Abia, Lagos and Kebbi had, in a few days, lodged their payments. The executive secretary, who decried sundry challenges bedeviling basic education in the country, recalled that UBEC was appropriated N29.7 billion in the 2020 budget for capital projects, while N1.3 billion was allocated to Federal Teacher Scheme; N2.8 billion for Constituency Zonal Intervention Projects (ZIP) and N25.6 billion for constituency projects (Capital). He said only N29.75 billion (99.2 per cent) was released to the commission as at December 2020. Bobboyi noted that with the capital releases, the commission awarded contracts of N27.5 billion for 2,895 constituency projects across the country, adding that 939 of such projects had been completed and 1,956 others ongoing. The executive secretary said the projects comprised classroom construction and renovation as well as supplies of education items. He added: “Thirty states and the FCT have implemented 2018 (matching grant projects). Six states, namely: Anambra, Imo, Kaduna, Kwara, Ogun and Plateau, are yet to implement; while eight other states have implemented 2019 matching grants projects; 28 states and the FCT are yet to implement. In 2020, no state implemented the matching grants projects.”
