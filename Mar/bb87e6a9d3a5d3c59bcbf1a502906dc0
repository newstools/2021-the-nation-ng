Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu on Friday said this administration cannot afford to have a healthcare system that is not affordable to all. The minister disclosed this while flagging off the Pro Poor and vulnerable Person Social Health Insurance in Gwagwalada Area Council of the territory. Aliyu said with the flag off, the Administration has once again demonstrated that its programmes and activities are geared towards improving the lives and wellbeing of every FCT resident especially the poor and vulnerable persons in rural communities. The minister who was represented by the Acting Secretary of FCT Area Council Service Secretariat, Mrs. Omolola Olanipekun, noted that access to qualitative healthcare especially in hard-to-reach communities, remains a challenge to overcome. He stressed that the FCT Administration cannot afford to have a healthcare system that is affordable to only a few, “just as we cannot afford to have a health insurance scheme that is accessible to only a few.” Aliyu affirmed that the programme was a strategy for enhancing social inclusion, a demonstration of efforts to bring succor and hope to the poorest of the poor and vulnerable households, and a way to ensure that the FCT attains 100 per cent social health insurance coverage for all residents.
