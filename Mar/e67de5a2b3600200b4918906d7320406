 Commissioner of Police in Bayelsa State Mike Okoli has said no fewer than 42 suspects have been arrested and paraded by the police. Arms, ammunition and other exhibits were recovered from the suspects, he said in a statement yesterday, adding that the suspects were mainly armed robbers, murderers, thieves and cultists. The CP stressed that the arrests were possible within a few weeks due to the synergy between the police command and other security agencies and the willingness of members of the public to volunteer useful information to the police.  He said armed robbers masquerading as government task force team were paraded and the locally-made pistol used in the operation was showcased. Okoli said others paraded were five thieves who stole four hundred and forty four (444) mattresses meant for victims displaced by floods in the state. He said all the suspects would be charged to court at the conclusion of the investigation.
