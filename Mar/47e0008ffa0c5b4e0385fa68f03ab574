Former Italian international Giuseppe Bergomi believes the return of Victor Osimhen and Dries Mertens has strengthened the frontline of Napoli in the Serie A. Bergomi, a former Inter Milan star was particularly impressive with Napoli’s display in their 1-0 win over AC Milan at the weekend, describing it as crucial for a turnaround for Coach Gennaro Gattuso’s side. Bergomi told Kiss Kiss Napoli that the recovery of Osimhen and Mertens has given impetus to the attack of Napoli which came to fore against AC Milan. He said: “Very important victory for Napoli with Milan because they really interpreted the game well. “I think it could be a turning point even if Napoli has always remained in the fourth place, so they have always been in contact. “Winning head-to-head matches gives you self-confidence and awareness of your strength and the recovery of certain players from here to the end are key to doing well. The recovery of Mertens and Osimhen is fundamental, as Osvaldo Bagnoli said, it is the strikers who make the teams play well,” he added. Meanwhile, the victory over AC Milan may have doused the tension in Napoli as yesterday’s edition of Corriere dello Sport made it known that recent victories, like the last on the field of Milan, have recomposed the internal rift between the club and the coach. De Laurentiis and Gattuso made “peace” for the common good and in the name of the Champions League.
