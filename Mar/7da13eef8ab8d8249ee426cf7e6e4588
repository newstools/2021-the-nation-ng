In the quest to ensure increased food and job supplies to meet demand of the fast-growing Nigerian economy, the Federal Government, in collaboration with Ogun State Government, has organised a training programme for Agricultural Extension Agents on best global practices and efficient work delivery. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the four-day training held at the Ogun State Agricultural Development Programme, (OGADEP) office, Abeokuta, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alh. Muhammed Nanono, expressed optimism that it would enhance extension delivery and help achieve abundant agricultural production as it will help build capacity of youths and existing practitioners.  Nanono, represented by the State Coordinator, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Engr. Ganiyu Oseni, said the training was being conducted across the 36 states of Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory, lamenting that extension system, which started in Nigeria about 120 years ago, has declined, due to decreased funding, policy changes, reduced man-power and lack of interest of young people in agricultural entrepreneurship. The State Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr. Adeola Odedina, described the programme as a step in the right direction, saying it would enable farmers get consultancy services free of charge from the extension workers.
