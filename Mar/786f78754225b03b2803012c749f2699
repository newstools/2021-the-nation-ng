The Executive Director of Global Women for Quality and Sustainable Development (GWSD) Mariam Ezolome has declared active community participation is an important feature of every successful community intervention. She spoke during the training of community members on NEWMAP structures such as community Association (CA), Grievance Redress Committee (GRC), Site Committee (SC) and Resettlement Implementation Committee (RIC). GWSD is the Edo government NEWMAP focal NGO in the flood and gully erosion intervention projects across the state. The Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP) is a World Bank financed intervention to address the challenge of flooding and gully erosion. The project is running in not less than 22 states of the Federation. The training of members of various communities from the three senatorial areas of the state was to enhance community ownership and sustainability of NEWMAP infrastructures located in their various domains. Community members in the variously constituted committees are expected to protect the interest of the project and that of communities during and after the project intervention. Addressing participants at the training session the resource person, Dr. Andrew Segley, explained the roles and responsibilities of the members of the various NEWMAP committees. He emphasised the membership of the various committees was not salaried but based on voluntary service. Community participants at the training programme include those from Igbei in Auch, Edo North; Ugboha, Emu/Ohordua,Ibore, and Ewu in Edo Central; and Gapiona, Urora, Iguosa and Ogiso-Osunde in Edo South.
