The Lagos State Chairman, of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Bishop Stephen Adegbite will chair a dinner being organised by the Lagos chapter of the Nigeria Evangelical Missions Association (NEMA). The dinner is designed for church founders, pastors, church leaders, General superintendents, General Overseers, and various heads of denominations. The Lagos NEMA chairman, Pastor Edwin Ebeniro said in a statement that the dinner has been put together to intimate pastors on developments on various missions fields in the country and the need for the church to lend a helping hand to those fields. Ebeniro said the dinner had become necessary so as to create an interface between missionaries and the clergy. “Some pastors in Lagos are not aware of what is happening on missions’ fields, some don’t know how they can support missionaries. Some just don’t think missions’ is necessary. He noted that the first budget they cut if they have to cut funds is money for missions. We hope that the dinner will be a great platform to intimate them on the need to embrace missions and how they can assist missionaries on various fields.” The Lagos State Secretary of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Rev Toyin Kehinde is expected to minister at the event with the theme; Church and Missions and The Executive Secretary of NEMA Rev Andrew Gwaivangmin is expected to be a special guest of honour at the event.
