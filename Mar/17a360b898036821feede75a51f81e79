Abuja-based Prophetess, Rose Kelvin and her husband, Bishop Dr. Nwafor Kelvin at the weekend provided succour for thousands of less privileged Nigerians in Masaka, Nasawara State. At Masaka, a suburban settlement for most of the civil and public servants and self-employed in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Kelvin gave out food items as well as cash gifts. He prayed for God’s blessing on the teeming crowd, which gathered at Masaka Government Secondary School. The gesture, according to him, is aimed at assuaging the harsh economic situation in the country, considering the growing figure of poor Nigerians. He noted the need to reduce the challenges faced by the masses remained sacrosanct for her and her husband. Currently, he said, “standing at 90 million, the figure of poor Nigerians, regarded as the highest in the world is projected to hit 100 million by 2022 given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. Poor and vulnerable people live below the poverty line of $1.90”. Coming at a time when Nigeria’s unemployment rate as of the end of 2020 rose to 33.3 per cent from 27.1 per cent recorded as of second 2020, Kelvin stressed that her foundation would do everything possible to fete less privileged Nigerians. Storming Government Secondary School Masaka over the weekend, Kelvin splashed millions on the less privileged. According to her, the passion for charity outreaches goes beyond ministry.
