Founders of the grant-aided schools enmeshed in hijab controversy in Kwara State have urged the government to return to the negotiation table with them. However, they all resolved not to allow the wearing of Muslim veil (hijab) by female pupils in their schools. The Chairman, District Church Councils (DCCs), Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Rev (Dr.) Vincent Akintunde, refuted the allegation that the organisation had conceded to the directive by the state government to allow the use of hijab in its schools, with reference to ECWA Schools, Oja-Iya, Ilorin. He described the news as misleading, untrue and provocative. Akintunde said: “This is a mere propaganda.” The clergyman added: “We will like to put the records straight by asserting that ECWA is against the use of hijab in our grant-aided mission schools. We wish to inform the public that our initial concern was not the use of hijab. “Our initial concern borders on the ownership of the schools. Our contention is against the Kwara State Government, which allowed the Muslim groups, which subtly introduced the issue of hijab to the case to distract us from our primary concern even while the matter is still at the Supreme Court. “Following this backdrop, we consider the reopening of the 10 grand-aided mission schools and the permission to use hijab by the Kwara State Government, while the case is pending at the Supreme Court, premature, ill-motived and a gross violation of the rule of law. “We want to take the opportunity of this platform to tell the state government that ECWA will not accept the use of hijab in its schools under any circumstances and our schools should be given back to us.” The Archbishop of Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Kwara State, the Most Reverend Israel Amoo, advised the state government to return to the negotiating table with stakeholders in the hijab controversy towards finding a solution to the matter.
