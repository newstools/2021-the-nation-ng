 The Governor of Niger State,  Abubakar Sani Bello, has decried   insecurity in the state and assured that it would soon be a thing of the past. This was made known by his Deputy, Alhaji Ahmed Muhammed Ketso, who represented him during a visit to Ibrahim Badamasi University Lapai (IBBUL) According to him, insecurity is not peculiar to institutions in the state, but, rather it has become a national issue. “The government in collaboration with the Local Government Council Chairmen and traditional rulers are doing everything possible to protect lives and properties in  institutions across the state,” he noted. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Abu Kasim Adamu, urged the state government to boost  infrastructural development in the state. He said one of the problems affecting the institution was lack of adequate accommodation. According to him, more than 70 per cent  of the students lived off-campus. Ketso expressed satisfaction with the progress made on infrastructure in IBBUL He inspected  two  newly-built hostels  for students expected to reduce the number who live off-campus.
