Four members of the Delta State Anti-Cult team have been arrested in connection with the alleged rape of 19-year-old woman in Warri. It was learnt that the teenager was reportedly raped on Thursday in an uncompleted building. In a statement, rights activist Comrade Israel Joe said the woman was standing in front of her residence with a young man when her attackers, all anti-cult members, whisked her away. “Four of the men came down from the tricycle (Keke). They pointed their guns at the guy standing close to the girl and dragged her into their Keke. “They took her to an uncompleted church at Apala. She said only Efe, one of the four, raped her, while the others watched. She shouted but nobody came to her rescue. “The guy whom they pointed their guns at raised the alarm and policemen from B Division Warri quickly trailed the suspects and arrested them. “We have taken her to the hospital for test which proved the allegation pending justice from the court. The lady was hospitalised, but is gradually recuperating at the moment,” Comrade Joe said. A copy of the medical report dated Friday, March 26, was made available to The Nation. Acting police spokesman Edafe Bright confirmed the incident, adding that investigation was ongoing.
