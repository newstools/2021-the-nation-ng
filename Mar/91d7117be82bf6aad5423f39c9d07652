The House of Representatives on Monday summoned the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, (CBN) Godwin Emefiele, and the Chief of Army Staff, Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru, to appear before them to answer queries over the purchase of arms. This decision was taken at the meeting of the House ad-hoc committee on the need to review the purchase, use and control of arms, ammunition and related hardware by military, paramilitary and other law enforcement agencies in Nigeria. The duo were ordered to appear before the House on April 7, 2021, by 2 pm. Others invited were the Ministry of Finance, Bureau for Public Procurement, Ministry of Defence, and Ministry of Interior. Attahiru had sent a representative, Major General C. Ofuche at the committeeâ€™s last sitting, but this was rejected by the members. Members of the committee said the issue was a serious and sensitive one and needed the COAS to address them in person.
