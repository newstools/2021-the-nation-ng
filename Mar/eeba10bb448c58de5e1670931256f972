An Iyaganku Chief Magistrates’ Court in Ibadan on Wednesday ordered that three members of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) be remanded in a correctional centre for alleged arson. The three suspects Awodele Adedigba, 45,  Dauda Kazeem, 38, and Hassan Ramon, 33, were charged with  conspiracy, murder and arson. Chief Magistrate Olaide Hamzat, who did not take the plea of the suspects, for want in jurisdiction, ordered that they be remanded in Abolongo Correctional facility, Oyo town. Hamzat ordered the police to return the case file to the office of the Oyo State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. He adjourned the matter till April 21, for mention. Earlier, the prosecution counsel Opeyemi Olagunju told the court that the suspects on March 7,  at about 8am at Kajola village, Ayete, allegedly caused the death of a 45-year-old woman. He said that Awodele, Dauda and Hassan allegedly set fire to the house of the Ibarapa “warlord” Abdullahi Wakili,  valued at  N5 million. Another Iyaganku Chief Magistrate Court on Tuesday ordered the remand of Wakili in a correctional facility. The police arraigned Wakili, 70, alongside his sons, Abu, 45; and Samaila, 27; as well as Aliyu Manu, 20, before Chief Magistrate Emmanuel Idowu, on a six-count charge of conspiracy, murder, kidnapping and armed robbery.
