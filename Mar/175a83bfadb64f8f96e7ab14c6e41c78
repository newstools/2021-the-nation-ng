No fewer than nineteen (19) passengers were on Sunday killed in an accident along the Kaduna-Abuja Highway. The Nation gathered that the DAF trailer involved in the accident was said to be heading for Kano from Lagos when the incident happened. The Kaduna state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, the accident, which happened late Sunday evening, involved a commercial DAF trailer. He explained the accident was “caused by a combination of speeding, and an exploding tyre, leading to a loss of control, which caused the vehicle to veer into the bush.” Aruwan explained that 53 people were involved in the crash; 16 of them died on the spot, with three others confirmed dead later.
