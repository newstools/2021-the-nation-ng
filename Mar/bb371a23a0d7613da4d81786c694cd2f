A group known as Oodua Liberation Movement (OLM) has directed its members to ensure the protection of Yoruba people’s farmlands. OLM accordingly has directed its members to strengthen the processes of sensitization and gobilization of Yoruba groups and communities to restore and protect the Yoruba nation’s farm production across Yorubaland. OLM National Coordinator Taiwo Otitolaye said that: “these directives arose from a painstaking stakeholders’ meeting and deliberations. We reiterate that the only way forward for restoring the Yoruba glory is a flourishing value chain agriculture; which encompasses subsistence and commercial farming, processing and exports of world quality products. “These can only happen when we protect our farms and crops against marauding criminals herdsmen either in our forests, roadsides, those destroying our farmlands; or those parading residential gardens with cows. “The purported food blockage at our boundary further reveals a long time clandestine strategy to prevent Yoruba food sufficiency, food security and rural and growth. This calls for urgent actions.”
