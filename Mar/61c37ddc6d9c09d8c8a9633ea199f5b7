Rural women in 10,000 various saving groups made of up over 200,000 members in eight states have saved up N2.5 billion in the past five years. The groups, which are made up of 70 per cent of women, are spread across communities in Nasarawa, Benue, Plateau, Bauchi, Taraba, Kastina, Adamawa, Kebbi states. Country Director, Oxfam International Nigeria Mr Constant Tchioma, who spoke to reporters in Abuja at an event organised by the Nigeria for Women Project (NFWP), a World Bank Assisted Project, said this is collective in terms of assets. He said it was being used by the women in various services such as petty trading, marketing, farming. Tchioma added that the women use it in their children’s education, health care and empowering themselves and communities. He said: “For the past five years, we have been able to establish over 10,000 savings groups across eight states (Nassarwa, Benue, Plateau, Bauchi, Taraba, Katsina, Adamawa, Kebbi. And the groups have about 200,000 members with over 70 per cent of them women. “Collectively in terms of the assets, they have been able to accumulate N2.5 billion to this day and they use it for different services like petty trading, marketing, farming, they are using it for their children’s education, for their own health care. It’s really bringing in more into the household and it is empowering women to take more responsibility in their communities. “Basically, they are in the rural areas, we still have some scattered in Lagos, Delta and Enugu. But majority of them are in the other states earlier mentioned, which are more in the rural areas where they don’t have access to the banking system or microfinance banks. “So, what we have been able to do is to help them have that access to credit, savings and insurance. Insurance is important, you and I have insurance, but they don’t have insurance, there is no social protection but then with that they now have access to insurance by putting a little bit of money aside.”
