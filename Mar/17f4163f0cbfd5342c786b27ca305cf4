Genk striker Paul Onuachu  will replace Moses Simon in Nigeria’s squad for next week’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifying double-header against Benin and Lesotho. The change was confirmed on the verified Twitter handle of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) yesterday after French Ligue 1 side Nantes confirmed that Simon will not be reporting for international duty for Nigeria. French Ligue 1 club said in a press release  yesterday  that their international call-ups  including Moses Simon (Nigeria) as well as Kalifa Coulibaly, Charles Traore (Mali) and Jean-Charles Caselletto (Cameroon) will not be allowed to leave France for the AFCON qualifiers later this month. “Like several clubs in France, FC Nantes will not release its selected international players for matches outside of Europe during the next international break, scheduled for the end of March” , the press release said inter alia. Simon and his other  African teammates  were refused permission to travel because  they would be asked to spend seven days in quarantine upon  return to France, and would be unable to take part in Nantes’ crucial Ligue 1 clash against OGC Nice on April 4. Incidentally, the 25-year-old has been in good form heading into the qualifiers, scoring three goals in his last five appearances in the French top-flight, including his match-winning strike against French champions Paris St-Germain on Sunday. “Only that Paul Onuachu has been upgraded to the main list as we are not sure French clubs will release our players in France,” an official with the team told NationSports. This would be the second time Onuachu would replace  the pacy winger after the lanky striker replaced Simon ahead of Super Eagles fixtures against Sierra Leone in November.
