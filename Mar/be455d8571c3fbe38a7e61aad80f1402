The Chief Medical Director of Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Bida Dr Mohammed Usman, on Sunday said people seeking medical treatments outside the country were the bane of the successes of health care policies and operations in the country. Usman, who was the guest speaker at the annual general meeting of the Kutigi Old Students’ Association (KUOSA) and election, said this while presenting a paper on  “Medical Tourism: Matters  Arising” in Minna. He said in order to reduce the tide of domestic and international medical tourism, Nigeria would have to change its health care policies and patterns of operations. “This change should accommodate the health care needs of Nigerians at a lesser cost but on the right standard,” he said. According to him, the failure of primary health care structures within states and the country has been a major contributor to why most Nigerians travel abroad for medical care. Usman noted that there was the need for a review of all issues that fuel medical tourism such as  the restructuring of the structures viz: the primary, the secondary and the tertiary facilities as a way forward. He said the Federal Government had released between 70 per  cent and 100 per cent financial intervention to the health sector since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic for the provision of medical equipment, consumables and manpower training. Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello decried the huge resources spent on medical tourism in the state, saying that it could be channelled into overhauling the health care sector. Bello, who was represented by the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Muhammed Makusidi, said the state government spent over N300 million for indigent citizens in 2019 on medical tourism. He noted that the state government came up with a strategic plan to revitalise its health care system aimed at reducing medical tourism.
