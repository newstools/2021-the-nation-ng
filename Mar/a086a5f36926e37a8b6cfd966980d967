Three young men have been killed at an all-night birthday party in Odoba Otukpa, Benue State. A report by a resident of the community, Julius Ali said a man from Obu Otukpa, a neighbouring town, was hacked to death following a minor argument. The identity of the alleged killer was not revealed, but a reprisal attack from his kinsmen resulted in the killing of two others from Odoba community.  One of the dead was reportedly billed to bury his father, the late Pa Dick Okpeh, on Thursday.  At press time efforts to reach the police command failed. Two prominent chiefs from both communities were said to have visited the incident scene with a view to calming tensions.
