Senator Biodun Olujimi (Ekiti South) has lamented voters who were killed or injured during last Saturday’s by-election in the state were mostly her relatives. She insisted the mayhem during the poll was meant to intimidate voters ahead of the 2023 elections in the state. Olujimi told reporters in Abuja the exercise was generally peaceful until it turned bloody towards counting when some armed youths invaded the polling unit and started shooting with the aim of snatching the ballot boxes. According to her: “The first person I saw with serious bullet wounds was a cousin of mine and as I was trying to ask for an ambulance, my attention was drawn to the youth corper and a female police officer and others and I was confused. “We took the victims to the hospitals but only those with minor injuries were admitted while we took those with serious injuries to the Ikole General Hospital and the Federal Medical Centre in Iddo-Ekiti. “By the time we returned to the scene of the incident, two people were already lying down lifeless. “All those who were shot and either died or injured are from the same family. The polling unit is my own and all the voters there are from one big family.“We were always together. Members of the APC and the Peoples Democratic Party that died or injured are from the same family with me. We are relatives.’’
