  PACE Sports and Entertainment Marketing Company, organisers of the Higher Institution Football League, has debunked the announcing the acquisition of the HiFL Trademark and other spurious reports concerning its property. A certain  group reportedly announced earlier in the week the acquisition of Higher Institution Sports League (HISL) and Higher Institution Football League (HIFL) trademark. But PACE through its Head, Media, Dare Ogunyombo, affirmed that it still remains the bonafide owners of the HiFL trademark which it had registered in 2018.  “Pace Sports and Entertainment Marketing Limited (PACE) the creators, developers and the organisers of the Higher Institution Football League (HiFL) affirms that the Trademark including the device and logo of HiFL is rightfully owned by PACE as we had the appropriate application made to register the said trademark prior to the commencement of the first HiFL season in 2018 and same was accepted in writing by the Registrar for Trademarks, Patents and Designs, Abuja in April of the same year,” Ogunyombo wrote in a statement distributed to the media. “As such, we advise that further clarification be sought from the rightful owners i.e. PACE prior to any further publications on this matter. “Please note that our legal team is also taking the necessary actions to address this matter.” he added.
