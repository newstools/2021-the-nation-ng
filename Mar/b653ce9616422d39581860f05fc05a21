Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has urged the new state Head of Service, Pastor John Adeyemi, to avoid distraction by focusing on mobilising Permanent Secretaries and other Accounting Officers behind the Strategic Plan of his administration code named REDEEMED. Governor Akeredolu said individuals who indulged in unbridled acts of disloyalty, laziness, insubordination and other unethical behaviours would not have any place in the scheme of things. He spoke while swearing in Pastor Adeyemi as the new HoS. Pastor Adeyemi replaced Mr. ‘Dare Aragbaiye who just retired from service. Governor Akeredolu who urged top echelon of the service to continuously be re-invigorated for effective service delivery said the Public Service would have a key role to play in actualisation of his dreams for a better Ondo State. He expressed confidence in the ability of the new HoS to provide the required leadership for civil servants to be at their best at all times. The Ondo Governor noted that both public servants and political office holders must work as partners in progress devoid of acrimonious tendencies in the conduct of government business. He said, “I enjoin you to remain focused and avoid undue distractions which are bound to confront you in the discharge of your duties. On our part, we shall continue to encourage and promote diligent, hardworking, loyal and competent officers to assume leadership positions in the State Public Service.”
