Ogun State Government has beefed up security in its schools to forestall kidnapping of students for ransom or rituals by gunmen and bandits. Governor Dapo Abiodun disclosed  this when he received members of the House of Representatives’ Committee on Basic Education, led by the Chairman, Prof. Julius Ihonvbere, who visited him in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. He said about 600 schools would be rehabilitated across the state as part of efforts to provide a conducive environment for teaching and learning before the end of his first tenure. The governor described the condition in which children learn as ‘deplorable’,  saying although his administration has invested so much in infrastructure in the education sector, much still needed to be done to achieve result. Prof. Ihonvbere hailed the state for paying it 2018, 2019 and 2020 counterpart fund, noting that Ogun still had about N2.7billion to access from UBEC.
