 Toyin Abraham’s upcoming film, Ige – The Unlikely Oil Merchant- has been slated for a premiere at IMAX Cinemas, Lekki, on April 3. Directed by Biodun Stephen, ‘Ige’ tells the grass to grace story of Nigerian oil magnate Bashir Fakorede who rose to the top of his chosen field against all odds. The film’s script is an adaptation of Fakorede’s biography written by his wife, Tayo Fakorede when the oil magnate turned 50. Ige features Lateef Adedimeji, Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi, Oyebade Adebimpe, Taiwo Hassan, Yomi Fash-Lanso, Adediwura Blackgold, Anta Laniyan, and singer Shola Allyson among many other great talents. Speaking at the private screening of the movie in Lagos, Mrs. Fakorode said the idea for the movie was borne out of the passion to pass a message across to youths who think life is like a bed of roses. “The movie is to encourage the youths and teach them that hard works and determination pays and that most successful people don’t just wake up in a day and become rich, there is always a story behind those successes”, said Yeye Fakorede.
