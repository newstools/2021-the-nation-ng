 The fastest man in Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala believes he can be the face of sprint in Africa ahead of Nigerian athletes when the 3rd  Making of Champion (MOC) Grand Prix kicks off today at the Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH) in Lagos. More than 700 athletes have reconfirmed their registration for the event  as Kenya, Benin Republic and Togo are the three foreign teams  adding international  flavour to the meet which has Betking as its major sponsor. Meanwhile, the University of Nairobi undergraduate who ran 10.11secs earlier this year is among the foreign athletes listed in the men’s 100m at the two-day meet which serves as an avenue for athletes to meet up the qualifying time for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Omanyala told journalists yesterday in Lagos that he is ready to extend Kenya’s dominance in athletics to sprint events. “I am so excited to be part of this tournament in Lagos especially with the weather which would help me to run faster unlike in Kenya which is a bit cold. I love the track and I can’t wait to compete against some of Nigeria’s finest sprinters. I know people think Kenya is only god in distant races but I want to change the attitude by becoming the face of sprint events in the continent. It promises to be exciting and I am looking forward to running another fastest time in Lagos,” the 25-year-old said. According to Founder/CEO of MOC, Bambo Akani, the event would be staged in line with COVID-19 protocol as fans would not be allowed to be part of the event. “We are excited about this year’s event especially with the presence of athletes from some African countries who are adding international outlook to the event. We are very happy to also announce Betking as the major sponsor this year and we hope they have come to stay with athletics. For this year’s tournament, we hope to get athletes picking their tickets to Tokyo as the results from previous events have always been ratified by the World Athletics (WA),” Akani said.
