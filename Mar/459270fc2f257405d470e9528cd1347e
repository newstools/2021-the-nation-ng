  Yoruba rights activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho, has urged security operatives to go after killer-herders, not local hunters and security guards who use single or double-barrelled guns for protection. In the now viral video posted by Chief Femi Fani-Kayode on his official Twitter handle, as obtained by The Nation, Igboho, speaking in Yoruba dialect, cautioned security agencies against framing innocent people.  He warned security operatives not to be biased in carrying out the shoot-on-sight directive given by President Muhammadu Buhari. Igboho said Yoruba leaders were happy with the directive, as it would end herdsmen menace. He, however, advised security operatives to go after killer-herdsmen and bandits armed with AK-47 rifles in their hideouts as revealed by an Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi.
