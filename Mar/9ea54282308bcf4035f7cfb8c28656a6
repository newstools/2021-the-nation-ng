  For consistently taking Nigerian fashion imprint beyond borders by globalizing the local, Oluwaseyi Adekunle aka ‘Seyi Vodi’ would easily win the highest fashion award. His creative prowess, eye for details and excellence is second to none. When Seyi started, his road was indeed rough. At a point, many thought he was going to be swept off by the business tsunami and typhoon but with doggedness, consistency, and prayers there was light at the end of his tunnel. Today, his Abuja office is always filled up to the brim as customers troop in and out every second. In a few months, Seyi Vodi will celebrate its 20th anniversary as a full-fledged fashion business conglomerate. Sources said the Geology graduate from the University of Maiduguri is mapping out plans to make the celebration grand and probably commission his new office complex, Fashion Hub, located in the heart of Abuja. The entrance of the architectural masterpiece office complex is designed with a gigantic sewing machine which is a symbol of fashion. All the office wares were reportedly imported to give it a lovely fitting and make it a lovely ambiance for all fashion lovers.
