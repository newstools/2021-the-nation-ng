Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has advised the Federal Government to arrest and prosecute Kaduna’s controversial Islamic cleric, Sheik Ahmad Gumi. Gumi, it said, has been aiding and abetting terrorism with his open rapports with bandits in Niger and Zamfara States. The group accused President Muhammadu Buhari of not doing enough to ensure the bandits that kidnapped school children in Zamfara, Katsina and Niger are arrested. In a statement jointly issued on Sunday by the National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf, HURIWA also blasted the National Assembly for not investigating the various revelations by bandits and security experts on the insecurity in the North East. HURIWA said: “There have been many earthshaking revelations made by the leaders of the different armed Fulani invading terror networks in the North West which in summary accuses the Federal government of arming the terrorists before the 2019 polls and then abandoning them soon after the election was over. “Why is the National Assembly playing deaf and dumb to these stunning revelations? The failure of the National Assembly headed by surrogates and bootlickers of President Muhammadu Buhari to probe these accusations made by terrorists against the President Muhammadu Buhari, is against the spirit and letter of Section 4 of the Constitutional provisions contained in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of 1999(as amended) as stated in the following subsections-: “(1) The legislative powers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria shall be vested in a National Assembly for the Federation, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.”
