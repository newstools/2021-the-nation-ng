A 97-year-old rape victim in Yobe State has said she had not had sex in over 40 years until the encounter with her amorous attacker recently. The Nation learnt that the woman lost two teeth from the beating she received from her rapist who forcibly tried to cover her mouth. The woman was brought to the state CID headquarters in Damaturu from Gadaka for investigation. She looked tired and exhausted but could still speak clearly and answer a few questions. Her 35-year-old rape suspect has been remanded in police custody by a magistrate court. The Nation earlier reported that Mohammed Faruk on February 8, 2021 invaded the womanâ€™s house at Gadaka, Fika Local Government Area, and assaulted and raped her. A police statement released by spokesman Dungus Abdulkarim said the suspect confessed to the crime.
