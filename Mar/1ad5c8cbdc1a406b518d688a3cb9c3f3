Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has warned that Nigeria is sitting on a keg of gunpowder, making reference to the state of insecurity across the country. Governor Ortom spoke to State House Correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at Aso Rock on Tuesday. Ortom, who recently escaped an assassination attempt on him by unknown gunmen in his state, also charged Nigerians, especially politicians, to leave anxiety about the 2023 elections for now and pay attention to the security situation at hand. According to the governor, he had deep discussions with President Buhari on the attack on him and security situation in the country, adding that the President agreed with him that no person or group should be left as sacred cows. He added; “I want to let Nigerians know, especially those who are responsible for making inflammatory statements; we’re sitting on a keg of gunpowder, everybody’s not in doubt in Nigeria today about the security situation and without security, there can be no meaningful progress going on. “So, it is important to put heads together, do the things that are lawful, let us protect the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria so that everybody will be secure.”
