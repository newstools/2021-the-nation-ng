The Director-General (DG), Lagos State Pension Commission (LASPEC), Mr. Babalola Obilana has said the government has paid 336 pensioners N1.49 billion as benefits. He restated the  government’s commitment to the speedy resolution of pension issues, pledging to ensure the prompt payment of pensioners’ entitlements. Obilana, who spoke at the 83rd Bond Presentation to the pensioners in Lagos, said LASPEC is dedicated to the retirees’welfare having worked hard for the progress of the state. He said LASPEC was established to take care of the needs of retirees, a role the commission has been performing  and will continue to devote itself to. Expressing gratitude to the retirees for cooperating with the agency and adhering to the rules, the DG explained that this has resulted in a greater percentage reduction in delay of the payment of their entitlements. “We could have sent these bond certificates to everyone at home, but we deemed it proper for everyone to be here so that we can reiterate that LASPEC is open to all for questions. It gives us great joy that there has been a big reduction in reports of retirees being swindled of their entitlements. “This is because the retirees are better enlightened as a result of our constant advocacy as well as open door policy at LASPEC,” he added.
