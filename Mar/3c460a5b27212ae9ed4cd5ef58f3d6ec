Chelsea and Liverpool will meet in the Champions League semi-finals should they both win their quarter-final draws. The Blues will face off against Porto as the Reds will meet Real Madrid in a repeat of the 2018 final. Chelsea will be pleased to have avoided all of the big guns in the quarters to land the kindest possible draw in Porto. But Tuchel declared after eliminating La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid this week that his side would fear no-one. “I’m sure no one will want to play against us and there’s no need for us to be afraid,” he said after guiding Chelsea to this stage for the first time since 2014. “Quarter-final means there’s only four games – it’s a big step and feels excellent.”
