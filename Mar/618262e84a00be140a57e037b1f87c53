The Northern Stateâ€™s Governors Forum Forum has condemned the attack on the convoy of Benue Governor Samuel Ortom. It described it as a disturbing development, which must be investigated thoroughly. Chairman of the Forum and Plateau Governor Simon Bako Lalong, in a statement, said the attack on Ortom was yet another daring attempt by criminals to cause mayhem not only in Benue State but in the nation. While praising the security details of Ortom for repelling the attack and securing the Governor and members of his entourage, Lalong said relevant security agencies must carry out a detailed investigations to fish out those behind the attack and their sponsors. According to him, all hands must be on deck to tame the degeneration of security that threatens the corporate existence of the nation. Lalong said Northern Governors stand in solidarity with their colleague and everyone in Benue, assuring they will continue to engage and support security agencies in their duty of securing the region and nation at large.
