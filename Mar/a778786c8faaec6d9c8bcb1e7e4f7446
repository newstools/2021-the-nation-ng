Lagos State will continue to tap into the experience and expertise of its senior citizens, to deliver optimal service to the people, Head of Service Hakeem Muri-Okunola said at the weekend. He spoke at the seventh Annual General Meeting (AGM) and inauguration of the third executive committee of the Association of Lagos State Retired Heads of Service and Permanent Secretaries (ALARHOSPS), at the Adeyemi Bero auditorium in Alausa, Ikeja. Muri-Okunola said: “Engagement of stakeholders in determining government activities is paramount to us in Lagos. One of the important stakeholders is our senior citizens, especially those who passed through our public service. “The initiative behind establishing ALARHOSPS is that government cannot do it alone and all hands must be on deck. I urge them to partner Lagos.“
