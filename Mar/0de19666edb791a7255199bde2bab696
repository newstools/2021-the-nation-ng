A middle-aged man, Joseph Manya, on Wednesday prayed a Customary Court in Kafanchan, Kaduna State, to dissolve his marriage, accusing his wife of denying him sex. Manya also told the court that his wife, Patience, had stopped taking good care of the home and their four children. “My wife refuses me sex all the time, she also doesn’t take good care of our four children and the home front in general. “This is why I have come before this honourable court to help me do the needful and dissolve the union,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Patience, however, denied all the charges brought against her. She requested the custody of the four children and the sum of N107, 000 monthly for the education, feeding, healthcare and general upkeep of the children. The presiding judge, George Gwani, adjourned till March 30, for the petitioner to call witnesses to prove his case.
