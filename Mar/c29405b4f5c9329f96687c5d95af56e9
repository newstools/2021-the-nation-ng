The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has urged well-wishers of its newly appointed chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, to stop paying to congratulate him. In a statement by its spokesman Wilson Uwujaren on its official handle @OfficialEFCC, EFCC said resources spent on the congratulatory messages can be channeled to worthy causes, such as internally displaced persons (IDPs). The EFCC said it has observed the increasing number of messages published in the print media by groups and individuals, congratulating Bawa on his appointment but noted that the chairman only needs support and prayers. “While the open exhibition of affection and solidarity may be salutary in our cultural milieu, and indeed appreciated, it is however inauspicious at this point in time and gradually turning into a distraction,” the statement reads. “Mr. Bawa is assuming the leadership of the EFCC at a time of great challenge and he desires to hit the ground running. “What he needs from well-wishers and indeed all Nigerians, is support and prayers, and more importantly, credible information that will further the work of the Commission,” the Commission stated.
