 BBNaija season five runner-up, Dorathy Bachor was recently spotted hanging out with two popular entertainers, Falz and Femi Adebayo. Dorathy was spotted with the entertainers alongside actress, Sophie Alakija, at the unveiling of the tallest beer bottle by Trophy. The Trophy fibreglass structure which has been considered the tallest bottle according to the Guinness World Records, had the brand’s ambassador, Falz and Adebayo celebrating with Dorathy, who was a guest at the event.  Speaking on the achievement, Adebayo said, “There is no doubt that Trophy has set the bar high with this ingenious idea to unveil the tallest beer bottle. It’s a magnificent piece and is certainly representative of Trophy Lager’s domination of the beer category in Nigeria.” In the same vein, Marketing Manager Trophy, Bamise Oyegbami, said, “We refer to the Trophy consumer as “Honourable” because of our deep conviction that our consumers are a reflection of our brand, and so for us, it is not just about making the next sale, rather, it is the burning desire to consistently give our consumers a unique experience and that’s why we have erected the largest fibreglass structure of a muskie.”
