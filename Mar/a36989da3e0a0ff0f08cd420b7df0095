The faith-based television channel, Hallelujah, will return ahead of the coming Easter celebrations. According to a statement from Chief Customer Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria, Martin Mabutho, the pop-up channel will return on Sunday, March 28 till Monday, April 5, 2021. Mabutho explained that the pop-up channel is specially curated with faith-nourishing television content for every member of the family this Easter. “We are delighted to bring back the Hallelujah pop-up channel to our DStv and GOtv customers this Easter holiday. Easter is one of the principal holidays for Christians and a sacred time when families come together to mark the joyful resurrection of Christ. The pop-up channel will provide our customers a wide selection of Christian programmes, from different denominational Christian groups in the country, that will keep families connected and entertained during the season,” he said. For its return, Hallelujah is scheduled to feature a new segment, Rejoice. The segment, a live musical performance show, will be hosted by Segun Obe, and feature performances by top gospel artists such as Tim Godfrey, Onos, and Frank Edwards. Hallelujah first kicked off in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown to enable Christian faithful to experience church from home with a line-up of praise and worship sessions, sermons, choir ministrations, prayers, and more from different denominational Christian groups across the country including RCCG (City of David), KICC, Daystar, Dunamis, House on the Rock, Salvation Ministries, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos.
