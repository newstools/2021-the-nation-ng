The Federal Government has extended working from home directive for civil servants from GL 12 and below until the end of March. Head of Civil Service of the Federation (HOCSF) Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan  gave this indication in a statement issued by Director, Press and Public Relations, Office of the HOCSF Mr. Abdulganiyu Aminu. “All public servants on GL12 and below have been directed to continue working from home till the end of March 2021.” Dr. Yemi-Esan said the latest directive was in adherence to the advice of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19.  She stressed that the COVID-19 downward trend needed to be maintained and, therefore, there was need for the extension of the work-from-home directive.
