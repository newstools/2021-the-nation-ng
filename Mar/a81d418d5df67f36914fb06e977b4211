Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have intercepted illicit drugs worth over N2billion at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja, Lagos. Three suspected traffickers were arrested. One of the suspects, Aniede Chimezie Bright was arrested on Sunday March 28, 2021, during the outward clearance of passengers on Air Maroc, allegedly with 7.1kg of Methamphetamine carefully concealed in food spices and packed in a Swiss Polo suit case. The substance was bound for Spain with a street value of over N2 billion. Commander, MMIA Command of the NDLEA, Ahmadu Garba said, “Unarguably, the closure of borders occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for the surge in the price of these drugs. For instance, the price of meth in Australia had increased from 200 dollars to 600 dollars per gramme due supply cut, hence the desperation by the traffickers and barons alike.” In a related development, the Command equally intercepted one Bamidele Babatunde Adeyemo at SAHCO export shed of the airport with 800 grammes of cannabis sativa while operatives also seized 19.950kg of green leaves suspected to be khat. The cannabis cleverly concealed in foodstuff was bound for Dubai, UAE. In a follow-up operation, one Asonye Christian was arrested in connection to the seizure 800grammes of cannabis, while investigations are ongoing with a view to establishing more leads and getting the owner of the khat leaves arrested.
