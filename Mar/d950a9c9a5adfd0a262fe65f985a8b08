The National Chairman of the Action Alliance (AA), Hon Adekunle Omoaje, on Monday, threatened to institute legal action against former members for organising a parallel convention. The party chair alleged that some former party members led by the former chairman of the party, Mr Kenneth Udeze, held an ‘illegal’ convention contrary to the party’s national convention held in Osogbo, Osun State capital under the supervision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). This was contained in a statement personally signed by, Hon Omoaje and made available to newsmen in Osogbo, capital of Osun State. He noted that Udeze couldn’t have contested for the post or any other position in the party, having being expelled from the party. Omoaje denied knowledge of any national convention held in Abuja or any other part of the country, saying such gathering was without the knowledge of the party. “Udenze and his co-travellers should learn how to respect the party’s constitution and also abide by the rules governing events within the party. He’s fighting the battle which he can’t win.” “I will institute legal action against Udeze and other former members after meeting with the leadership of the party and determine further steps to be taken.” He said the purported convention held at the instance of Udeze was null and void as it lacked the backing of the party’s recognized leadership and not supervised by INEC, which is the accredited organ saddled with such responsibility. He, therefore, called on members of the public, especially political groups to disregard the parallel convention.
