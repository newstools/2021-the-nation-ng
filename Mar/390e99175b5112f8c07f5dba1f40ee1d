 Kwara State government has taken delivery of its share of the COVID-19 Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines from the Federal Government. The consignment arrived at the Ilorin International Airport about 8.30p.m on Tuesday and was received by the government’s delegation, led by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, Dr. Abubakar Ayinla. Executive Secretary of Kwara State Primary Healthcare Development Agency Dr Nusirat Elelu told reporters the state was excited to witness the delivery. “We are certainly very excited to receive these vaccines for Kwara. This is a very historic day in the history of not just Kwara but the country. This signifies that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  “COVID-19 has ravaged the world in the last one year and I know that those that have lost loved ones or are down with COVID-19 or just recovered from COVID-19 will know that this is certainly a historic day for us. “We expect our people to come out and get themselves protected (once the schedules have been released) because the vaccines have been proved to be effective against this infectious disease. This is an opportunity to protect our people against the deadly disease. “The vaccine is going to be administered in four phases. The first phase will target the  frontline health workers, people that work at the port of entry, members of the military and some of our strategic leaders. The reason we are also prioritising our strategic leaders is for them to serve as an example to show the world that the vaccine is safe, effective and efficient,” Dr Elelu said. She assured Kwarans that administration of the vaccines will be launched within a few days.
