National Security Adviser Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd) has stated government is not aware of how monies meant for the purchase of arms were spent under the immediate past Service Chiefs. He also revealed government cannot also trace the arms claimed to have been bought. Monguno, who made the disclosures in an interview with Hausa service of the BBC, explained the new Service Chiefs also said they have not seen the arms bought by their predecessors. According to Monguno, it is still unclear how much President Muhammadu Buhari has spent on arms and other equipment to fight insecurity. He said the government was working hard to address the ongoing security crisis, “which some Nigerians saw as a serious setback.” The NSA said: “No one knows what happened to the money but God willing, the President will investigate to find out where it went or where the goods went. “As long as there is no proper investigation, I will not say anything but the money is gone, the goods are not seen and the new Security Chiefs say they have not seen it. “Some may be on their way from the United States, England or elsewhere but now I don’t see them on the ground. The President has done his best to provide out-of-pocket funds but the goods have not been procured”. Efforts by The Nation to get the Defence Headquarters to comment on the matter were abortive. The Director Defence Information, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu did not respond to calls and text messages. Troops fighting Boko Haram terrorists in the Northeast have severally protested lack of modern equipment to battle the insurgents.
