A High Court in Ibadan on Wednesday ordered the EFCC to sell two iPhones belonging to a 22-year-old barber, Lamidi Qudus and the proceeds be paid in Federal Government coffers. Delivering judgment, Justice Sherifat Adeyemi, also ordered the convict his $472 (about N193, 048) to the Federal Government. The court also sentenced Qudus to one-month of community service for defrauding an American, Charlie Andson of $472.92. She advised the convict who claimed to be a barber to shun criminal act and engage in meaningful activities. Earlier, the EFCC counsel, Dr Benedict Ubi, informed the court that the convict on Nov. 17, 2020, under false pretence obtained the sum of $472.92 through gift cards from Andson. Ubi said the convict pretended to be a 32-year-old female and an American and that he was in love with Andson and ready to marry him. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provisions Section 419 of the Criminal Code, Law of Oyo State, 2000.  (NAN)
