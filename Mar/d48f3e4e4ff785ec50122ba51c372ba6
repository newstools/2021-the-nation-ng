 Nigeria international, Leon Balogun, has declared his intention to stay at Ibrox – the player is more than happy for the club to take up the additional year option that they have on his current contract. This is something that manager Steven Gerrard has spoken about previously, given the relative success of the Nigerian international defender so far in his time as a Ranger. In a wide ranging, informative and insightful interview with Sport 1 in Germany – Balogun’s country of birth – the 32-year old signalled his intentions to settle in further to life in Glasgow. He was asked about his career path to date and if he has planned a return to Germany.  Balogun responded: “I was born in Berlin and if there were another opportunity for me at home or in Germany, it would be outstanding.” “But with Rangers we are first looking at the Champions League, if we successfully qualify. Who wants to miss this?” “When I stop playing football, I will return to Germany.” “If it happens before then, I don’t mind. But my near future lies with the Rangers.”
