Former Ekiti Governor Ayodele Fayose on Monday night stated that President Muhammadu Buhari has disappointed Nigerians. He further explained that Nigerians are disappointed because of his failed promises. Fayose, on his official Twitter handle, carpeted the visit of former Ogun Governor, Gbenga Daniels and ex-Speaker Dimeji Bankole to Buhari, describing them as “political wanderers”. He said:”Nigerians are not interested in the President receiving political wanderers in the Villa.They are more interested in their well-being, especially security. “They want to see a president who’s proactive in handling affairs of the country, rather than receiving recycled politicians. “Most importantly, Nigerians are not interested in how many politicians that decamp to APC, which is already a dead party. “The President should rather make himself available to Nigerians who can help solve our unending financial and security challenges amongst others.” “Above all, I wish the President knows how disappointed Nigerians are about him and his failed promises.”
