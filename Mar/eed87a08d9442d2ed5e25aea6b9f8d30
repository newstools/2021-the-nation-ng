Two firms Old Mutual Insurance Nigeria PLC and Future Females Invest (FFI) are set to celebrate the International Women’s Day today. Co-founder, FFI, Tori Abiola, said  the event would hold on Victoria Island, Lagos. She said: “It is clear that Old Mutual understands women, how to communicate, and to enable behaviour change. This partnership is not just about selling insurance, but it’s about building trust with women and enabling them to understand how insurance lessen the risks of future losses in their business. “IWD 2021 has the  theme,  #Choose to Challenge and is aimed to celebrate women’s achievements,  increase visibility, while calling out inequality. “IWD applaud equality for women in Innovation, applaud equality for women in sport, educate women on health choice and decisions.’’ Co-founder FFI Aysha Tegally added:  “IWD 2021  calls attention to increased visibility of women creatives, forges women’s empowerment and builds inclusive workplace for women to thrive. “IWD marks a call to action for accelerating women’s equality and this began over a century ago, with the first gathering in 1911 supported by men and women of goodwill and corporate organisations  that respect women’s contributions to economic development.” Head Marketing and Customers Experience, Old Mutual Nigeria, Alero Ladipo, added: “The empowerment of women is an area the Old Mutual Group is focused on. “Over the past decade, the Nigerian woman does not understand the importance of insurance as a means of investment. COVID has turned the world upside down. We are living in extra ordinary times. Women have been disproportionately impacted and it is of paramount importance that women plan for their future and against this backdrop. “The new innovative partnership shall leverage the strengths of Old Mutual and Future Females Invest to create compelling value for both companies and women.”
