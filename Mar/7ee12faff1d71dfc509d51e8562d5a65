Nigerian rapper and singer, Raymond Emamezi, with the stage name “Ray’Em” is back with two new singles, “Courage” and “Ándale” after a long break. Emamezi, in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said courage is a motivational trap song that addressed the artiste’s fears and talks about his desires as a human. “On the other hand, Ándale is an Afro-fusion gem with an Amapiano-Esque beat inspired by the popular chant of a cartoon character, “Speedy Gonzales,” he said. It would be recalled that Ray’Em released a raving party track “Mama Roll” in 2012 and a remix featuring esteemed rapper, Yung6ix. “A lot of people cheer my new and unique sound which is a laid back calm style of rapping and singing,” he said. He described his style as a breath of fresh air when up-tempo songs had become the trend. Ray’Em said that he was back and set to share a new and improved version of himself, adding that Courage and Ándale are available on all music platforms. The Delta-born rapper is known to combine the arts of rapping and singing, guiding his listeners with an often laid-back flow, packed with true-to-life lyrics. (NAN)
