 The Ogun State Agency for the Control of AIDS (OGSACA) will continue to assist the Local Action Committee on AIDS (LACA) in  the planning and implementation of programmes as well as removing bottlenecks in HIV/AIDS activities. Its Community Mobilisation Officer, Mrs. Bola Durosomo, made the promise during monitoring tours to LACA offices in Abeokuta North, Abeokuta South, and Ewekoro Local Government Areas (LGAs). She pledged its support to  stem the tides of the HIV/AIDS, particularly at the grassroots. She commended the medical officers of health in the LGAs in tackling the menace, seeking adequate documentation of data regarding HIV/AIDS at the health facilities, emphasising the need to complement federal and state governments’ support. The Medical Officer of Health, Abeokuta North LGA, Dr. Atinuke Duse, applauded the team for the visit, saying dedication to duty would help achieve the government’s goal. The Chairman, LACA Managers in the state, Olori Oyekan Ogundeji, who is also the LACA Manager, Abeokuta South Local Government, lauded the government for the supply of consumable kits to health facilities across the state, promising that they would not relent in their efforts to track and provide treatments for people living with HIV.
