The Lagos State Sector Commander of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Corps Commander Olusegun Ogungbemide, has admonished the staff to be of good conduct, especially while discharging their duties and to also cultivate a positive attitude to work. He made the call when he paid a maiden courtesy visit to RS 2.112 Lekki Refinery Command and Dangote Refinery. The visit according to CC Ogungbemide was in line with the Corps 2021 Corporate Strategic Goals to broaden, sustaining stakeholders engagement, improving personnel capacity and competence in Road Safety Management. He applauded the excellent performance of the Command’s personnel and commended a patrol team led by DRC A Amodu for upholding the Corps mandate by rejecting a sum of N1,500 bribe from a foreigner who was apprehended for traffic offence. The Sector Commander appreciated the Dangote Refinery for their logistics support in replacing the Command’s vehicle which got burnt during the Dangote Group staff protest and tow truck which is used in moving faulty vehicles causing impediments on the corridor. He later solicited for strengthened collaboration in order to achieve the organisational goals. In response, the Group Executive Director, Edwin Devakumar, described the organisation’s relationship with FRSC as mutually beneficial. He stated that the Command has been helpful in training truck drivers which has improved their driving culture, traffic control and clearing of impediments within the vicinity, and reduced road traffic crashes due to the Command’s enlightenment programmes.
