With coconut trees being one of the best plants that naturally remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Carbon sequestration) to mitigate global warming, Rector of the Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), Dr. Oluremi Nurudeen Olaleye has flagged off the planting of 2,000 coconut seedlings. Olaleye said agriculture had a special place in his nine-point agenda aimed at positioning LASPOTECH to compete as a world-class agriculture-focused tertiary institution. He spoke of plans to partner  multinational investors to improve agricultural development in the institution and explore the coconut value chain. “Coconut can be used for a wide range of purpose, as to enhance the sustenance of our wellbeing as a people, due to its multiple advantages, ranging from ornamental, economical and food security. It is appropriate for us as an institution to be problem-solvers to our host communities and the nation at large, and to also improve the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the institution,” he said. The Dean, School of Agriculture, Dr. Adebayo Ashafa, appreciated the management for the initiative, stating that staff and students were ready to key into the agricultural plans the institution would venture into.
