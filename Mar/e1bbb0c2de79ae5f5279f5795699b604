Absence of the prosecution counsel on Thursday stalled trial of 14 associates and workers of the former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha in an Owerri Magistrate Court. The 14 loyalists and workers of Senator Okorocha, were on February 22, 2021, accused of conspiring among themselves to disobey a lawful order issued by the state by removing the seal of the state government and entering the sealed premises of Royal Spring Palm Hotel and Apartments belonging to Okorocha. The director of public prosecution who is the state counsel, Mr. S. C. Ibechem, informed the court that he had taken ill and was only in the court to explain his inability to continue persecution of the case. He said he needed to consult his doctor for medical attention and prayed for the matter to be adjourned. The defense counsel, Chief Eddy Onyema, informed the court he had no objection to the prayer made by Ibechem. The matter was subsequently adjourned to April 22, 2021, for continuation of prosecution by the Magistrate, Mrs. B. U. Adikaibe.
