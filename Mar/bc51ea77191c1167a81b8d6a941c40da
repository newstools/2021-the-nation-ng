 The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state  have expressed shock and sadness at the death of a former Technical Director of the Federation and one-time Technical Adviser of The Gambia National Team, Chief Kashimawo Laloko. Chief Laloko, the Olori Parakoyi of Egbaland, died at the Sacred Hearts Catholic Hospital, Abeokuta at the age of 76 on Sunday. Abiodun said the death of the seasoned  football administrator, who he described as one of the finest football administrators Nigeria has produced, would no doubt leave a gap in football administration in Nigeria. He added that his football college at Orile-Imo, where education is blended with football, served as a model to other football academies, which had produced champions, particularly at the age grade soccer competition.  He said: “Chief Laloko’s death is not only a blow to the Egbaland and Ogun State, his death will create a serious gap in Nigerian football family, particularly in the area of developmental and grassroots soccer. ” Until his death, he was an advocate of hiring local coaches for our international football teams, while his passion for ‘local contents’ in our teams was well known and acknowledged.” Meanwhile, NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi described the late Laloko, as “an astute football administrator of the first grade and a peerless youth developer who was passionate, diligent and effervescent in his activities.” “We have lost another big tree with the demise of Chief Laloko. He served the game and the nation with all his ardour and zest. We cannot question God. We can only pray that God grants him eternal rest and grant those he has left behind the fortitude to bear the big loss,” Sanusi added.
