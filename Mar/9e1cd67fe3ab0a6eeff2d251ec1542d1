Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has urged members of the Lagos State University (LASU) Special Visitation Panel to be fair and firm in the appointment process of a Vice-Chancellor (VC) for the institution. The six-man panel is headed by former VC of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Prof. Bamitale Omole. Other members are Prof. Ayo Olukotun, Prof. Joseph Ajienka, Olujimi Olukoya, Lawal Pedro and Mrs. Funmilola Olajide as secretary. The panel is to look into issues relating to the appointment of a substantive VC for the institution, which had been a subject of controversy. Sanwo-Olu, who swore in the panel at the State House in Ikeja, said: “Please ensure the process is flawless and fair. “By the powers vested in me, I urge you to come out with the best solution for the appointment of a VC.  “Please discharge your responsibilities with fairness, firmness and forthrightness, to ensure the university takes its rightful place in the committee of universities.”
