Enyimba of Aba failed to move to the top of the Group A standings in the CAF  Confederation Cup following their 2-1 loss to Orlando Pirates at the Orlando Stadium yesterday. Pirates took the lead in the 27th  minute when Hotto found the back of the net in superb fashion when he back-heeled the ball home after he was set up by Mntambo. Enyimba were awarded a penalty on the stroke of half time after Mpontshane was adjudged to have fouled Anayo in the box. Oladapo stepped up and made no mistake as he sent Mpontshane the wrong way as the game went into the half time break level at 1-1. Pirates were awarded a penalty of their own in the 76th  minute when Mhango was fouled in the box. Mabasa stepped up to take the penalty but the slippery surface caused him to slip, lobbing the ball over the bar. Mabasa then made amends for his earlier miss in spectacular fashion as he came out of nowhere to head the ball into the back of the net at the near post from a resulting corner. The Buccaneers pressed forward in search of another goal in the closing stages of the game but held onto their 2-1 lead until the final whistle to walk away with all three points at home.
