The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ebonyi State, Barr Onyekachi Nwebonyi and the State Executive Committee of the party, Saturday defected to the All Progressives Congress, (APC) in the state. Others who defected were chairmen of the 13 local government area chapters, including the chairmen of 171 wards of the party. The defection took place at the Pa Oruta Township Stadium, Abakaliki. Recall that Nwebonyi was sacked by the national executive of the PDP late last year following the defection of the state governor to APC. But he and other state executives of the party headed to court to challenge the decision. In February, a high court sitting in Abakaliki quashed their removal and also sacked the Fred Udogu-led State Caretaker Committee installed by the national executive. The Udogu committee appealed the judgement but the court was yet to rule on the matter.
