A fire in Isan-Ekiti, the hometown of Governor Kayode Fayemi, at the weekend destroyed 20 hectares of cocoa and kolanut plantations. Its cause could not be ascertained at press time. A community leader, Chief Ray Akin-Oguntosin, said the fire affected cocoa, kolanut, orange and coffee plantations and rendered farmers jobless. Occupants of 200 houses at Erimope- Ekiti in Moba Local Government have been rendered homeless following a rainstorm which occurred last Friday. The Chairman, State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Capt. Sunday Adebomi (rtd), described the incident as sad. He said: “Governor Fayemi commiserates with the victims. He is, however, happy that nobody died.”
