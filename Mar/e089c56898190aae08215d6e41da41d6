As part of the activities to mark this year’s International World Women’s Day, Nigerian Society of Engineers, Lagos branch, led by Engr. Ayotunde Ogunnoiki, celebrated some female engineers and spouses of some male engineers of the branch with public lecture entitled: #ChooseToChallenge. The Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Works & Infrastructure, Engr. Aramide Adeyoye, in her presentation said, women are still underrepresented in public life and decision making, saying statistics made available by UNHCR shows that 60 per cent women around the world are in informal sector, earning less, saving less and are at greater risk of falling into poverty. “We need women’s representation that reflect all women and girls in their diversity and abilities across all cultural, social economics and political situations. This is the only way, we will get real societal change that incorporates women in the decision making as equals and benefits us all,” she said. Also speaking at the event was the Managing Director, Nigerian Port Authority, Hajiya Haduza Bala, represented by Assistant General Manager, ICT, (Network & Communications) Engr. Anthonia  Ohagwa, said this year’s celebration, is a call to action not just for accelerating gender parity but coming at a time when there is need to develop skills needed to work remotely with the use of technology, increase visibility and effectively positioning women to excel in their respective professions if sustainable future is to become a reality.
