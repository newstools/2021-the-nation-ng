It’s Sevilla again for Barcelona today as the two teams clash in the second leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final live and exclusive on StarTimes. A final against Athletic or Levante awaits the winner of the tie with Sevilla heading into the match with a two-goal advantage after the first leg. Yet Barca won by the same score line at the weekend in the  La Liga and have home advantage which should make for an intriguing clash at the Camp Nou. Ousmane Dembele and Lionel Messi were both on target against Sevilla in La Liga on Saturday and could be set to continue their partnership in the Barcelona attack. If they do, that would be more bad news for Antoine Griezmann who will be forced to start on the bench for the third game in a row. The Frenchman is available if Koeman does fancy switching things up, while Francisco Trincao and Martin Braithwaite are also options. The match will be played at 9 pm on StarTimes’ World Football Channel as Levante will face Athletic Club tomorrow  at 9 pm also on World Football Channel.
