A girl has narrated how her father choked her mother to death in the Odojomo area of Ondo town, Ondo State. The man simply identified as Gbenro reportedly strangled his wife Wayesola as she woke from sleep and was going to use the bathroom. The incident happened at Salvation Army Street, OdojÍmu, Ondo town, about 6am. Their daughter Fayoke said she saw her father strangling her mother when she got up to use the bath but could not do anything because he threatened to kill her. Fayoke said it was her mother’s cry for help that attracted neighbours. She died before the responders got to their house, Ayoke said. Police spokesman Tee-Leo Ikoro said the matter has been transferred to the state CID for further investigation.
