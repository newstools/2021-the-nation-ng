 A newly established record label, Danarow Music, has signed on two music talents as it forges ahead in the Nigerian entertainment industry. The new music acts, Temidire and H Dot, were discovered by talent management expert and label CEO, Arowolo Daniel. Speaking on the label’s new signing, Arowolo said “I believe solely in music and mostly in their sound. You have to listen to their music to know what I’m talking about.”  Continuing, he said, “As an experienced talent manager with vast experience, I can tell you that these guys are one of the best to happen to Afro beats. There are lots of talents out there that need platform but we have chosen to work hand in hand with these two and I pray that God in his mercies help us attain our set goals on time.” Temidire, a twin, was born Salami Taiwo while H Dot was born Bello Hameed Tomiwa. Temidire said he discovered his talent through his father’s obsession with indigenous music genres. On his part, H Dot began his career at the age of 15 with the support of his brother who supported his career through studio sessions and as well learning as a music producer.
