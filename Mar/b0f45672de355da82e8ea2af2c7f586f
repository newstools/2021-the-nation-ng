Member Owan constituency of Edo in the House of Representatives, Prof. Julius Ihonvbere, said he has left the “vindictive” Governor Godwin Obaseki to God over Tuesday’s demolition of his house in the Government Reservation Area (GRA) Benin. He noted demolition of his house by Obaseki was not the end of the world. Ihonvbere, who is a former Secretary to Edo State Government (SSG), told THE NATION on phone: “Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is behind the demolition of my house in GRA, Benin City. “My demolished house had approved building plan while the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) was approved by Godwin Obaseki, as the Chairman of the Economic Team in the administration of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. “When Governor Obaseki suddenly revoked the C of O of my house in January this year, without giving any reason, I filed a suit to challenge the decision. “The case is still pending in court, but Obaseki opted to demolish my house. He will not be Edo governor forever.” The federal lawmaker, who is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), also urged his teeming supporters to remain calm in the face of provocation.
