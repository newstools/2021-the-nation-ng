 As a student of Biochemistry at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Bhadmus Mariam Ayodeji started the sales of children and adult fashion accessories on a small scale. She prayed fervently to her creator to enable her business empire to grow astronomically. Years ago, Bhadmus never knew what started as a joke in the university was going to change the face of affordable kids and adult fashion accessories within the Oyo State metropolis, with her upscale fashion accessories store, Rubeeys, which is situated in the heart of Ibadan, Oyo State. While working as a media strategist at a corporate firm, Bhadmus had a passion for business. At this point, she took a big decision by quitting her paying job and gave the growing business all the needed attention as she walked the path of an entrepreneur. Within a few months, the stylish mother of two launched her well-stocked-up walk-in store in the heart of Ibadan, where she sells baby essentials, kid’s clothes, shoes, toys, back-to-school essentials, party packs, decorations. The hard decision is gradually paying off as the store is fast becoming the go-to place for all fashion accessories of all age grades. After the success recorded in Ibadan, she has begun planning to expand her business tentacles to serve her customers from other states. Sources said she is planning to replicate her success in Ibadan by launching two new stores in Abuja and Lagos. “Mariam is not leaving any stone unturned, she looks to create more job opportunities outside Ibadan where her business started from. The Abuja and Lagos store would finally kickoff before June this year. She is expending millions of Naira to make sure the branches become fully functional to meet the needs of her teeming customers across the country.”
