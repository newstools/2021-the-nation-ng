 Leaders of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) have indicated interest in jointly appointing nine leaders to serve as trustees of the church, to end factionalisation. The church went into crisis in 1990 over leadership, which eventually led to emergence of two factions, which have been dragging each other to court since then without a solution. But both factions set up a nine-member unification committee last November to end the 30-year old crisis. A member of the committee told The Nation that the committee has worked out an agreement that will see each faction contribute leaders that will serve as trustees for the unified church. The agreement also includes that all pending court cases will be withdrawn to enable the unified church come into being.  This came as a faction of the Supreme Council named new officers in Ibadan yesterday to pilot its affairs. The authority of the faction, which has its headquarters in Agbowo, Ibadan, named Pastor S. O. Ogundare as President, Pastor A. O.  Akinwole as the General Superintendent, Prophet  E. O.  Alonge as General Evangelist and Pastor Paul Eniola Adegbite as General Secretary. Others are Pastor Nathaniel I.  Oyewole (General Treasurer) and Pastor M. B. Ayantoye (Publicity Secretary). Ayantoye told The Nation that the unification committee has made progress in its work, including drafting of a new constitution for the church. He said each faction was already working to send names of trustees to the committee, adding that the church would  file terms of settlement in court to pave the way for the unified CAC.
