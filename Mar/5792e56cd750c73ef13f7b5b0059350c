  Members of the Orubo community in Ikenne Local Government Area of Ogun State have protested what they called the ‘invasion’ of their farmland by the government. They claimed that the land measuring approximately 136.070 hectares at Iperu, on Iperu-Ilishan Road, has been taken over by the state compensating the owners. About 100 members of the community gathered at the governor’s residence in Iperu, and marched to the disputed land carrying placards bearing various inscriptions. The protesters included the head of the Orubo family of Iperu Remo, Alhaji Waidi Alaka, Assistant head of the family, Neye Moibi, family secretary, Shobamowo Taiwo and Olumuyiwa Olayinka among others.  Alaka alleged that the government was carrying out an illegal clearance and construction of survey pillars on his family’s land for a proposed Cargo Airport by the Office of the Surveyor-General of Ogun State. He said: “Up till the time of issuing this statement, the government of Ogun State under Gbenga Daniel or any other subsequent administrations never served the Orubo family any notice of revocation of our land including the portions sold to the three companies aforesaid for their alleged Cargo Airport nor was any compensation paid…” The family’s lawyer Mr Babatunde Oshilaja said it was in possession of the judgement of an Ogun State High Court, delivered on October 10, 2011, by Justice N.I Saula in suit NO HCS/123/2002 Ope Osu & others Vs Jonathan Famodu & others which confirmed that the land being cleared belonged to Orubo family.
