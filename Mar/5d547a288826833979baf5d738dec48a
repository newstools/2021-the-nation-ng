Ekiti Governor Kayode Fayemi has vowed not to politicise the mayhem and attendant killing that broke out during the bye-election in Ekiti East State Constituency 1 on Saturday that left three dead and several injured. He spoke on Sunday during a condolence visit to Omuo-Ekiti, the headquarters of Ekiti East Council Area where the violence broke out leading to the suspension of the exercise. Fayemi was accompanied by Commissioner of Police Tunde Mobayo and other leadership of security agencies in the state. Speaking at the Palace of Olomuo, Oba Noah Omonigbeyin, Fayemi prayed against the reoccurrence of the gory incident in the state, saying his government would not tolerate violence and other manifestations of brigandage capable of stoking ember of hatred. Fayemi noted the suspects arrested in connection with the killings during the bye-election would be dealt with to serve as deterrence to other political thugs.
