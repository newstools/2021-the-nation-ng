Police in Bayelsa State have arrested two persons for alleged murder. Christopher Chiabata, 56, was apprehended for allegedly killing his 46-year-old wife with a pestle during a domestic fight, while Lazarus Josiah, 29, reportedly strangled his 58-year-old mother. Chiabata said on Tuesday while being paraded at the police headquarters in Yenagoa  that he hit his wife with a pestle during a heated argument arising from the sale of their farm produce. He said, “Any time my wife went to the market, she would carry all the money that we made from the farm and put it in her pocket. It is getting to two years and she has not given me any account. “When I asked her to give me the account, she usually refused. And as we went to the farm, we quarreled. When we returned home, she packed my belongings and threw them outside. “From there, I became very angry and had to hit her head with a pestle and she died.” Josiah reportedly confessed to killing his mother, saying he suspected she was a witch, and responsible for his lack of progress in life. He confessed: “l used my bare hands to kill her because she wanted me to stay with her forever and I was not making any progress.”
