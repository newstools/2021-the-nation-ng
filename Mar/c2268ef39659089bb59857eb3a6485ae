The refusal by the Morocco government to bar people from some countries from entering their country over COVID-19 may have taken its toll on the departure of Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets to Morocco for the 2021 AFCON U-17 championship taking place in Morocco. NationSport learnt that the Confederation of African Football (CAF) are in talks with the government of Morocco on their stance against some African countries as South Africa, Algeria and Egypt are among the countries barred from travelling to the North African nation due to COVID-19. This development may prompt the continental football ruling body to postpone the tournament by two weeks. Golden Eaglets were scheduled to depart Lagos to Morocco today for the tournament to be held between March 13 and 31. The team made up of 25 players and 11 officials were  to fly out  to Morocco  today aboard Air Maroc  through the Murtala Muhammed Airport after spending a night  in Lagos following their arrival from Abuja yesterday but that plan has suffered a  setback. The Coach Fatai Amoo-led side is grouped in Group B along with Tanzania, Congo and Algeria with matches to be played at the Stade El Bachir in Mohammedia.
