Suspected herdsmen on Sunday allegedly invaded the residence of mother of Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho. Igboho’s spokesman, Olayomi Koiki, confirmed this on Sunday night via his Twitter handle. He wrote: “Chief Sunday Adeyemo’s mother’s house at Igboho was invaded by three Fulani men this evening around 7:54pm. “Two of them escaped, one is currently held at Igboho police station.” A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode also confirmed the development on his twitter page. He stated: “Three terrorists were caught in Sunday Igboho’s mothers house and not two. One was caught and two escaped. “I just spoke to Sunday Igboho and he told me that two foreign Fulani terrorists were apprehended in his mother’s home in Igboho, Oyo state this evening. “Their mission was to harm Mama. One of them escaped whilst the other is with the police. Those that sent them are playing with fire.” He added: “I am appealing to those who are behind these provocations against his person & reckless attacks to desist from this nonsense. “Sunday is a heroic figure in the South West and by far the most powerful, vocal and popular figure in Yorubaland today. “Harming him or his family members will not augur well for the peace and stability of our nation.”
