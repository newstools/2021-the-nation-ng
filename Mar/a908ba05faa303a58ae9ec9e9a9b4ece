 Edo State Government has reviewed the curfew imposed in the state over Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), which will now be from 12 midnight to 5 a.m., instead of the earlier 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., which most Edo residents had complained about. Edo Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, disclosed that reviewing the curfew was in view of the remarkable progress being made in containing the COVID-19 pandemic in the state.  Shaibu made the disclosure yesterday during a news briefing, while noting that civil servants were now to resume working for regular work hours, but they must comply with Edo’s COVID-19 protocols. He said: “While compliance to all non-pharmaceutical measures against the infectious diseases must be strictly adhered to, we urge eligible members of the public to avail themselves the opportunity and get vaccinated against the deadly virus.”
