Nigerian rapper and singer, Eedris Abdulkareem, has expressed delight after he  was presented with a special recognition award for his contribution to the Nigerian music industry on Sunday February 21. “I was elated, I felt appreciated and I felt happy and re-invigorated to keep doing my best for a better Nigeria for us all,” said Eedris. The musician and activist was presented  with the award during the 14th edition of the HEADIES which was held at Eko Hotel and Suites on Victoria Island, Lagos. The ‘Jaga Jaga’ singer also appreciated the Smooth Operations and its boss, Ayo Animashaun for the recognition. “I thank my brother and friend Ayo Animashaun for his steadfastness and never say die attitude towards the promotion of our music and the practitioners themselves. Thank you Ayo, thank you HipTV and I am also sending out a hearty thanks to my fans for making this possible.” Abdulkareem, however, didn’t fail to throw jibes at perceived enemies of the Nigerian music industry saying, “And for all the other media houses and media personalities who are still playing the ostrich and downplaying or simply sucking the life out of our music and the entertainment industry as whole, while mouthing their empty and pitiable support for the industry, please do learn from Ayo and HipTV and turn a new leaf before it is too late”.
