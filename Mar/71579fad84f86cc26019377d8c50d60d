The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has assured less than 70% of Nigerians would be vaccinated against the pandemic by 2022. Chairman of the PTF and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, revealed this on Monday, during a media briefing in Abuja. He said: “Vaccines alone cannot solve the virus problem in the country. Over 2021 and 2022, we aim to vaccinate 70% of the population. “This development offers a huge ray of hope that comes with its own challenges and responsibilities for all Nigerians. We must all be prepared to take responsibility. “The development of vaccines is a ray of hope is a welcome development; vaccines alone cannot be a solution; accessing vaccines has been strategic and deliberate.” Taking a review of the national response, which clocked one year on Saturday, February 27th, Mustapha said the Nigerian experience had been a success, reeling out the achievements of the PTF in the year. He categorised the achievements into policy decisions, human capital building, building the infrastructure, support to sub-nationals, building collaboration, testing as a strategy, building other support capacity, recalibration of the economy, West Africa/ECOWAS as well as transparency and accountability.
