Ireland has become the latest in a line of countries to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19, following reports of recipients suffering from blood clots. “Following new information we received from the Norwegian Medicines Agency on Saturday and after a meeting with the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee has recommended that the administration of COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca be temporarily delayed from today,” said Dr. Ronan Glynn, Ireland’s Chief Medical Officer. “It has not been concluded that there is any link between the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca and these cases,” he said. “However, acting on the precautionary principal, and pending receipt of further information, the NIAC has recommended the temporary deferral of the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca vaccination programme in Ireland.” Ireland now joins Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Iceland, Italy and Norway in suspending use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. There, too, the authorities admit there is no causal link shown as yet. But, AstraZeneca Plc yesterday said it had conducted a review of people vaccinated with its COVID-19 vaccine, which has shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots. The review covered more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union and United Kingdom. “A careful review of all available safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union and UK with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or thrombocytopenia, in any defined age group, gender, batch or in any particular country,” the statement said.
