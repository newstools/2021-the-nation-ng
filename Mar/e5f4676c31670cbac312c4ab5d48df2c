The Southeast Caucus of the Senate on Wednesday, charged the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu and heads of the nation’s security agencies to expeditiously fish out those responsible for the recent killing of natives in Ebonyi State communities. The Caucus in a statement by Uche Anichukwu – media adviser to former Deputy President of the Senate/Leader, southeast Caucus, Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, in Abuja, insisted that the killing must not go unsolved and unpunished like others before it. “This act is most unfeeling and gruesome, and we condemn it in totality. But more importantly, this must not go unpunished like others before it. “It is imperative to warn that the Nigerian state is fast delegitimising itself by its failure to discharge the primary purpose of government, which is security and welfare of the people, as clearly prescribed in Section 14 of the 1999 Constitution. “The widespread killings and all manner of violent crimes across the country have continued to worsen because the perpetrators walk away with their crimes, never arrested or brought to book. “Therefore, this is particularly a call on the Inspector General of Police and the heads of security agencies to bring the perpetrators of the Ebonyi killing to book expeditiously. “To do otherwise will amount to further loss of government’s exclusive power of coercion to non-state actors and brigands, leaving citizens and constituent parts of the country with no option than to further resort to self-help” they stated. The Caucus also condoled with the Government and people of Ebonyi State on the sad development. “We stand in sympathy and solidarity with the Government and people of Ebonyi State over this dastardly incident and will give every necessary support to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book,” the Caucus said.
