Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule has explained that he is not just consulting stakeholders, he is campaigning for Senator Tanko Al-Makura to emerge as the next National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said he has been in contact with all the major stakeholders of the APC across the country on behalf of the immediate past Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura. Governor Sule, who stated this while speaking with reporters at the government house Lafia said: “When you advise that the party should be fair to CPC in choosing the next APC National Chairman, you now start the campaign. I think we have gone beyond advice now. “So, I’m campaigning; I have done the consultation at different levels of the party; I have been in contact with all the major stakeholders of the APC and we strongly believe that what we are asking for is fair. “What we are asking for is not too much for the party to do, what we are asking for will actually keep the party together and that is what we have been saying. “I have gone beyond just making a plea. I have gone to the stage of making consultations, speaking with the right people who are supposed to be part of this. “I’m speaking with all the decision-makers, I’m in contact with the highest authority of the party at the national level, especially, speaking with my colleagues, the governors, to support Senator Tanko Al-Makura,” he said. He explained that he is not just demanding that the APC national chairmanship position should be zoned to North Central, but should be given to Nasarawa State.
