Air Peace and Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria (AIB) yesterday disagreed on the circumstances leading to its Boeing 737 experiencing a burst tyre at the Lagos Airport on Tuesday. The airline said the  investigator misrepresented the facts in the incident involving its aircraft which had a tyre burst while taxiing to a stop and not on landing at Lagos Airport. The denial is coming after the AIB said it was investigating the incident of a tyre burst of the aircraft on landing at the airport. In a statement, the airline said: “The attention of Air Peace has been drawn to reports insinuating that our aircraft, a B737 with registration number 5N-BUQ, had a tyre burst on landing in Lagos on Monday night, March 8, 2021. “The aircraft safely landed at the International Wing of the airport and while taxing to the Domestic Wing, had a tyre puncture which cause is yet to be ascertained.” “The incident, which occurred at about 12 minutes of taxing and very close to the Domestic Wing, was duly reported to the authorities. Passengers disembarked seamlessly and the incident is currently being investigated as statutorily required. “We, therefore, take exception to reports implying that the aircraft had a tyre burst on landing, as this is conveying a wrong impression about the airline to the flying public. If the tyre had burst on landing, the aircraft would not have moved two kilometres from the International Wing to the Domestic Wing. Air Peace is committed to providing best-in-class fight services and will relentlessly observe the highest standards of safety in its operations.”
