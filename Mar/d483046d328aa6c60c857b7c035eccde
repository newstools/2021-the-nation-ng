Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle, Ebi Egbe, has warned that the Super Eagles cannot afford to take anything for granted in the back-to-back AFCON  ties against Benin and Lesotho. Egbe,  a FIFA licensed match intermediary,  stated that both games would be tricky, given the terrain where they would be played. He noted that the pitch in Porto Novo is one which the Eagles would not be comfortable with given where they are coming from. “The matches in Porto Novo and Lagos are going to be very tricky games for the Eagles. I know the Eagles won’t like the turf in Porto Novo because I have been there and know how bad that turf is,” he said. Egbe  would further disclosed that the Beninese  football authorities had before now actually contacted his firm Monimichelle to renovate  the turf of the  Charles de Gaulle Stadium. “I was there at the stadium in Porto Novo and took measurements; I know what Eagles would face there because it is not the best of playing surfaces.” Meanwhile, Egbe has  stressed that Nigeria and other African countries must invest in hybrid synthetic pitches similar to what they have in Europe if our players must do well when they come home to play in Africa.
