 Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has signed the bill for the Prohibition of Unlawful Societies and Cultism of 2021 into law, approving 21-year jail term for convicted cultists. The House of Assembly last month passed the anti-cultism bill, which also stipulates 15-year jail term for anyone found guilty of abetting cultists and residents who willfully allow their properties to be used as meeting points by cultists. Sanwo-Olu assented to the bill at the swearing-in of newly appointed members of the stateâ€™s Public Procurement Agency Governing Board and two permanent secretaries, held at the Banquet Hall in Alausa, Ikeja yesterday. At the event, the governor also signed three other bills into law. They are Lagos State Audit Service Commission (Amendment) Law of 2019, Lagos State Public Procurement Bill of 2021 and Coronavirus Pandemic Emergency Law of 2021.  The anti-cultism law repeals the Cultism (Prohibition) Law of 2007 (now Cap. C18, Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015) and provides for more stringent punitive measures, as well as makes its application all-encompassing and applicable to the public, as against the restriction of the previous law to students of tertiary institutions. The governor said the state had suffered the negative effects of unlawful societies and cultism, stressing that the new law sought to make parents and guardians more responsible and show more interest in the upbringing of their children and wards, to ensure that they do not become a burden to the society.
