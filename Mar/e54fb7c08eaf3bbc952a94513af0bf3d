GOtv Nigeria has announced the return of its special reward campaign, GOtv Dey Your Side, to show appreciation to its loyal customers for their continued support. The special discount will enable the customers to get discounts, more content and more value as from this month (March). The campaign, which begins Wednesday, will see customers on GOtv Jolli and GOtv Jinja enjoy discounts up to 32 per cent and an upgraded viewing on GOtv Max, which is the highest package offering on the platform. Chief Executive Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe, explained that the offer is borne out of GOtvâ€™s desire to show support to subscribers, who have remained loyal to the service, by offering them more for less money in an economic situation worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
