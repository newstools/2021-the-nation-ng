Edoâ€™s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Kontongs Bello, a Superintendent of Police (SP), confirmed the released of the two victims, whom he said were immediately reunited with their families. Bello assured that officers and men of Edo police command were working round the clock to arrest the five gunmen that carried out the dastardly act, while insisting that no ransom was paid before the lecturer and student were set free.

Edo Commissioner of Police, Phillip Ogbadu, had earlier enjoined members of the public to always cooperate with the police by giving credible information that would expose those behind heinous crimes in the state, while promising to work with the public, describing policing as the concern of everybody. Ogbadu urged members of the public to go about their lawful businesses without fear of molestation, insisting that the police command under his watch was on top of the security situation in Edo.
