A mob on Tuesday burnt a police station at Ishinweke, headquarters of Ihitte Uboma council area of Imo State. The angry community youths said they set the station ablaze in revenge of their kinsman allegedly killed by policemen in the area. Less than a month ago, some hoodlums burnt down a police station in Aboh Mbaise council area of the state. The protesting youths also burnt patrol vehicles and freed all detainees at the police station as police men on duty scampered for safety. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu confirmed the incident, saying that the operatives were attacked in the area when they went to make some arrests.Â  He said it was in a bid to protect themselves that a stray bullet hit one of the youths and he later died in a hospital.
