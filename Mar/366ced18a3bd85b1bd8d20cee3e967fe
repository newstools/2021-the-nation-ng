The Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, on Saturday warned that it was in the best interest of all Nigerians for the country to remain one, regardless of the current challenges. Oba Adedotun, a retired Brigadier-General, said Nigeria could not afford another civil war; neither could any country afford to absorb the huge number of Nigerians that could be displaced by any civil war. Gbadebo spoke when the national leadership of the National Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) paid him a courtesy visit in his palace in Ake, Abeokuta. Apparently reacting to agitation for separation in some quarters, Oba Gbadebo said he was personally opposed to such. He asked those calling for secession to shelve the idea, stressing: “if Nigeria fails as a country, the entire black race has failed.” He added: “Nigerians, wherever we go, we must see ourselves as nationals of the same country, people of the same blood. “We must work together to make Nigeria, Nigeria must not fail; if Nigeria fails, the black race has failed and may it never happen.” The monarch said Nigerians, irrespective of their tribe, political or religious afflictions, must work together for the greater good of the country.
