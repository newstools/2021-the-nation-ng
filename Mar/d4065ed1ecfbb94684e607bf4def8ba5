Africa legend  and four-time African Footballer of the Year, Samuel  Eto’o , believes the first FIFA World Cup  in the  Middle East , Qatar 2022 , would be the best ever. Speaking  during  a virtual media roundtable organised by the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, Eto’o noted that the oil-rich country  is hosting  the Mundial  as a ‘gift’ to the rest of the world, adding the stadia and infrastructures  being put in place for the event  are outstanding and spectacular. “ Personally, I think Qatar is hosting the 2022 World Cup  as a gift to the world and  I don’t want to look at the  financial  implication of hosting the  tournament because  it’s like giving  a gift to your wife, you don’t look at the cost,“ explained the  Cameroonian who  now resides in Qatar.“ I have visited all the stadiums that have been built as well as the ones that are yet to be completed and all what I see are  spectacles  and the whole world would be amazed with what  Qatar is going to present in 2022.” Yesterday marked 600 days exactly to the kick-off of the 22nd edition of the quadrennial event, and Eto’o enthused that Qatar’s preparations towards hosting the best tournament ever should inspire  African countries  to dream big. “Qatar 2022 should be an inspiration to Africa because they have visionary leaders  who dream  and what to do to be the very best; and I think Africa can emulate  this,” noted the former Barcelona striker. “Thanks to CAF, a lot of African countries can now boast of good infrastructures and take Cameroon  as an example,  they can bid to host major tournaments  with the kind of infrastructure on ground for  the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations next year. “ Hosting  the World Cup  would not only give a country visibility but it provides a business mechanism that  will be of benefit to the country  and  her citizens.”
