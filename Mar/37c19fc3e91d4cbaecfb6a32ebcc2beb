 The tiny Comoros Islands qualified for the African Cup of Nations for the first time with a 0-0 draw against Togo at home yesterday  to maintain their unbeaten record in the qualifiers. The result advanced the Comoros to nine points from five matches, guaranteeing them a top-two finish in Group G with seven-time champions Egypt, a fairytale achievement for the small island nation.  They moved level with Egypt, who also has nine points from five games, and ahead of Kenya on four ahead of the meeting between the two countries later on Thursday in Nairobi. Togo, who had already been eliminated and left almost all foreign-based regulars behind for the trip to the Comoros, still had the better of limited opportunities in a drab encounter.
