 Popular actor, producer, and director, Charles Inojie has built and donated a borehole to the Ohordua community in Edo state, where he hails from. Inojie, who as a little boy would walk three kilometers to the Utor river situated at the border end of a neighbouring community to fetch water twice in the morning before going to school is grateful to the Almighty for using him to change the narrative in his village after many years of leaving the village. Through the Charles Inojie Foundation, in partnership with the Latter-Day Saints Charity, a befitting borehole has been built in the community where the actor grew up.  “Needless to say that this project is for the entire community. I pray they own it, protect it and guard it jealously so that the intended benefits can be fully derived,” says ‘The Johnsons’ star. The commissioning of the community borehole is slated for April 3 at Eguare – Ohordua maternity grounds, Esan South-East LGA, Edo State.
