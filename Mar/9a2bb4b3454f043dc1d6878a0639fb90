 Coach Gernot Rohr was in the stands yesterday at the Agege Stadium in Lagos after Akwa United defeated home team MFM FC 2-1 in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL).  The German coach 24-man Super Eagles squad listed for the AFCON 2021 qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho have been depleted a few days to the tie following the decision by some European clubs not to release some of the players following Covid-19 protocol in some of the European countries.  With the withdrawal of some of the invited players, NPFL stars Adekunle Adeleke and Anayo Iwuala have been called up to replace Kenneth Omeruo and Sadiq Umar for the qualifier games against Benin Republic and Lesotho.  Adeleke, who is Abia Warriors defender became the third home-based player called up by Rohr for the games.  He was called up after Omeruo revealed  his Spanish club Leganese refused to release him for the clash.  Also, Enyimba’s Iwuala will replace Sadiq Umar who has been stopped by his Spanish club Almeria.  Sadiq, who has been in brilliant scoring form for Almeria, was looking forward to making his debut for the Eagles after he was included in 24-man squad for the qualifiers.  But Almeria announced there were fears protocols put in place in the club as a result of COVID-19 may have been flouted, hence their decision to stop Sadiq from travelling for the qualifiers.  With this development, the number of the home-based players in the 24-man list has increased to three for these games.  Goalkeeper John Noble of Enyimba was included in the initial 24-man squad, while Adeleke and Iwuala will join him in the team.
