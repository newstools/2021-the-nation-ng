Twice at the FIBA Women’s AfroBasket, Senegal were beaten to the title by Nigeria’s D’Tigress and ahead of this year’s tournament, Mame Marie Sy Diop  said the West African rivals won’t play the second fiddle again. The 35-year-old power forward admitted in an interview with FIBA official website that she is a hard fighter that would not give up easily, adding she is at the ready to guide her national team realize that dream at this year’s Women’s AfroBasket. “I am a very committed player in what I do. I am a fighter. On the court, I use my determination and commitment to participate in the collective goal. I put all the necessary means to win,” she posited. Though Senegal holds the most wins with eleven African titles, the 1.92m (6ft2in) says that her country is not relenting in reclaiming their pride of place. “We’re still aiming for the title. Senegal is recognized as the most successful country in Africa and it is our duty to keep the team at the highest level. We had years of failure but that is part of the sport. Senegal will bounce back to regain the title.”  “I can say that it is the rule of sport but at the same time we had our destiny in our hands. We were surprised by Nigeria in 2017 and normally we knew what awaited us in 2019 but unfortunately, we lost against a very good Nigeria team. “Nigeria wants to make history and that is understandable. It’s up to us to learn from our failures in order to be able to prepare properly for 2021 [African Championship].” Sy Diop who plays for Charleville-Mezieres (FCBA) of France alongside Nigeria’s Evelyn Akhator admits that Nigeria has a great team with good players but she maintains that Senegal is not below D’Tigress and still believe they can beat them. “Currently Nigeria has the psychological advantage over us as they beat us twice in the Final with deserving victories. It’s up to us not to be surprised yet again by the likes of Nigeria, Angola and others,” she added.
