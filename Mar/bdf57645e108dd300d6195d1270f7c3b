There seems to be a groundswell of uneasiness building among health workers, especially members of the Association of Resident Doctors in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) with regards to their welfare especially in the face of the covid-19 pandemic. According to them these issues, which date back to several years, ranging from unpaid salaries for some months in 2019, promotion arrears from 2016, 2017, and 2018, covid-19 allowances for health workers in isolation centres, and skipping of newly employed doctors. Speaking with The Nation, a medical practitioner who spoke under anonymity said: “It is quite unfair to the health workers especially the resident doctors who have their workplace as the only source of income. Doctors who were promoted and backdated are yet to be paid arrears since 2016 and unfortunately, most are due for another promotion, hence, creating unnecessary backlogs.” He explained that in these times of covid-19 pandemic, the health care frontline workers should be given priority considering the number of health workers being infected on a daily basis. He noted that the more these issues pile up, the more the uncertainty of the calmness in the health sector.
