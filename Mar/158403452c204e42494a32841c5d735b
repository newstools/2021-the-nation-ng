The bad state of Badagry expressway has impacted negatively on the socio-economic and political development of Lagos State, Chairman of Badagry Local Government, Olusegun Onilude has said. He noted that the neglect of the international route  has deprived the federal, state and local governments substantial revenues running into billions of naira which should have been used to solve part of the country’s problems. Onilude said apart from the economic implications of the expressway on the people of the local government, it has impacted negatively on the security of lives and properties . He said: “We squander the little resources at our disposal fixing our vehicles every day. Some had lost their vehicles through this. Some lost their loved ones and breadwinners while some had been kidnapped on the expressway. Such is the hazards the bad state of the road had brought on the people of Badagry. This is a deep pain to us. We are almost being emotional when we talk about the state of the road .The fact is, we feel neglected and abused. Socially, we have been ostracised as part of Lagos State. People in the state no longer refer to Badagry as part of Lagos. This is sad. “
