A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) aspirant for the November 6 Anambra governorship election, Senator Uche Ekwunife, has kicked against a consensus candidate among the aspirants jostling for the party’s ticket. Ekwunife, who represents Anambra central district in the Senate, stated this on Tuesday shortly after submitting her nomination documents for the race. She said: “I don’t see how a consensus arrangement will play out considering the galaxy of men and a woman in the race. “I am running to win, so I don’t see how consensus arrangement will work. It is a bit too late. That should have come before now”. Speaking on her plans for Anambra if elected, Ekwunife promised to reform the security architecture in the state, adding that she’s confident of picking the party’s ticket. “If elected governor, I will reform the security architecture. I will partner with the security agencies to make sure they are equipped with sophisticated weapons,” she said. The aspirant said she would not dump the PDP for any other political party if she failed to win the party’s ticket.
