Chad has been disqualified from the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers after the Government dissolved the Federation of Chad Football Associations (FTFA). The Group A strugglers were due to host Namibia on March 24 and visit Mali on March 28. But the two matches have been cancelled by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) with Namibia and Mali both handed 3-0 victories. Chad were out of the race to qualify as they sat bottom of the group with just one point from four matches. Chad’s Ministry of Youth and Sports dissolved the FTFA on March 10. The decision came after the FTFA ignored a previous request from the Ministry last December over a provisional withdrawal of its mandate. The CAF’s decision is one of the first to be made under the leadership of Patrice Motsepe who was elected President on March 12. Mali, who had already qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations, leads Group A on 13 points while Namibia sits just two points behind second-placed Guinea. The Africa Cup of Nations is scheduled to run from January to February next year in Cameroon.
