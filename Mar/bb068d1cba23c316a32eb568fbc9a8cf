The Super Eagles will face the Squirrels of Benin tomorrow in the penultimate round of the 2021 AFCON qualifiers and the  coach Gernot Rohr-led side is hopeful of squeezing out the Squirrels in their own backyard,  writes Tunde Liadi.  Three-time African champions, Super Eagles travel to 2019 AFCON quarter-finalists, Squirrels of Benin Republic for the reverse fixture in the race for 2022 Africa Cup of Nations slated for Cameroon. Gernot Rohr’s men came back from Stephane Sessegnon fifth-minute stunner to edge the Squirrels 2-1 in the first leg in 2019  staged at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo courtesy of Victor Osimhen’s 45th  and Samuel Kalu’s 63rd minute  strikes. Having picked unacceptable two points from possible six in the two games with the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone the last time out including letting slip a 4-0 lead in Asaba, the Super Eagles would be going all out for a win  in Porto Novo.  Unbeaten in their last four games, Michel Dussuyer’s team would fancy their chances of stunning the 2013 African champions as they are keen on reaching the finals for the fifth time after their remarkable performance at the last AFCON in Egypt where they were narrowly edged 1-0 by Senegal in the quarter-final.  Meanwhile, with three-pointer Sierra Leone, third in the pool, concluding their game away to bottom-placed Lesotho in Maseru earlier, the Eagles could be guaranteed qualification for the final tournament in Cameroon before kick-off in Porto Novo. Failure by the Leone Stars to pick all three points will mean Nigeria and Benin are through to Cameroon.
