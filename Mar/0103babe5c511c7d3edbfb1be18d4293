An 80-year-old retired lecturer, Prof. Muritala Haroon on Thursday told a Customary Court sitting in Mapo, that his wife Afsat denied him sex. At a resumed hearing in the suit, Haroon said, “My wife did not abide by the advice given to her by this court to allow peace to reign by agreeing to perform her wifely duties’. Afsat was absent when she was called and nobody represented her in court. The President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade, advised Haroon to exercise more patience. “The court will work with the extended members of the family to resolve the matter amicably,” he said. Odunade adjourned the case until May 17 for further hearing. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Haroon, in February, filed for dissolution of his 52-ear-old marriage on grounds of sexual starvation and threat to life. In the petition, he alleged that Afsat was fond of locking him out of the bedroom. “I can no longer cope with the attitude again. Worst still, she and her relatives want me dead. “Afsat attempted to stab me. She is misleading our six children. She has turned them against me,” he said. Afsat had in her reply, rejected the prayer for separation. “Prof is promiscuous. I cannot have anything to do with because he slept with his close friend’s three wives. “My lord, Haroon slept with the three wives of the man who acted as an intermediary whenever we had problems,” she said.
