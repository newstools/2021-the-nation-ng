The Ekiti Police Command has confirmed the arrest of three suspects over the violence that marred the Ekiti East State Constituency 1 bye-election. Commissioner of Police, Tunde Mobayo, said the suspected thugs were apprehended in their hideout and are in custody at the police headquarters in Ado Ekiti. Three persons were on Saturday shot dead by suspected thugs while five others sustained gunshot wounds during the House of Assembly bye-election conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state constituency. Mobayo, speaking through the command spokesman, ASP Sunday Abutu, stated that those arrested would be charged to court once investigation was concluded. “Yes, three suspected party things have been arrested. They were picked up where they were hiding and are now being detained in our headquarters. “Murder is a capital offence and police won’t watch and allow anyone takes law into his own hands freely. Nigeria is a nation being guided by laws. “Just like we assured our people on Saturday, everyone who had hands in the killings will be brought to book.’’
