Borno Governor Babagana Zulum has joined the growing list of prominent Nigerians insisting power must shift to the south in 2023. Zulum spoke at the golden jubilee lecture and public book presentation titled: ‘Strategic turnaround’ by the former Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Dakuku Peterside. Speaking on the topic: “Security and economic growth: Leadership in challenging times,” the Governor said: “The issue of power rotation is a covenant between us hence the need to shift the power to south.” He argued every part of the country should be given a sense of belonging, insisting “the time has come for Nigeria to do the right thing”. To fix national problems, Zulum said: “There must be a clear demarcation between competency and loyalty and our leaders must be chosen based on performance”. He added: “I would advocate as a starting point that good governance is the heart and soul of security and development. Bad governance will spread insecurity and destroy the possibility of development as trust is broken between the elected and the electorate. “A weak system breeds corruption and in order to survive, people will try whatever means to circumvent due processes and over time this will lead to insecurity. “The search for alternative means of survival that is not legal constitutes insecurity.”
