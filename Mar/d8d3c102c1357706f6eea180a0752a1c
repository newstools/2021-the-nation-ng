 CONFEDERATION of Africa Football (CAF) has approved only 7,200 fans to watch the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifying match between Super Eagles and Lesotho’s Crocodiles at the Teslim Balogun stadium in Lagos on March 30, 2021, our correspondent has reliably gathered. Our correspondent scooped that CAF approved in response to Nigeria Football Federation’s request to allow football fans to be allowed to watch the match in Lagos but warned that the football house must comply with the COVID-19 protocols. The latest figure released by the NFF is quite different from the news making the rounds that CAF had agreed for 10,000 Nigerian fans to storm Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos in a show of solidarity for the Eagles.  “The Super Eagles will be returning to Lagos for the first time in 20 years and we felt it would be unfair to play in an empty stadium hence we applied to CAF to allow us to admit fans into the Teslim Balogun Stadium for our game against Lesotho later this month. “Fortunately for us, CAF obliged by allowing the admittance of 30 percent of the stadium’s total capacity to watch the game. So we expect about 7,200 fans to be at the stadium to cheer the Super Eagles to victory on March 30. The total seating capacity of the Teslim Balogun Stadium is 24,000 and its 30 percent will be 7,200, explained NFF’s Director of Communications, Ademola Olajire in a post on social media. CAF however informed that it would not condone any breach of the COVID-19 protocols adding that temperature check of the fans and social distancing must also be strictly enforced.
