Popular Comedian, Oluwatoyin Bayegun, popularly known as Woli Arole, has narrated how he was detained in Lagos for allegedly violating the curfew put in place by the federal government due to an alleged flight delay by Air Peace. Arole, who took to his social media page, said Air Peace had allegedly delayed their flight from Abuja to Lagos for “hours without apology”. He further explained that their journey was postponed till 8:20 pm on Sunday before they eventually took off. Arole noted that the delay led to his detention by police operatives in Lagos for breaching curfew put in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. “I am really angry. How will an airline delay you for hours? No apology, nothing!!!!. @flyairpeace una well done. I have heard about you and you’ve proven yourself well. Una dey delay well well,” Arole wrote on Instagram. “I am just getting home. You know why police detained me at the station because I broke curfew? You know why I broke curfew? @flyairpeace delayed my flight of ‘Abuja to Lagos’. Imagine 8:20pm flight,” “Just in case you don’t see me in this country again I have moved! This country called Nigeria…if you’re not careful, you would be wasted. Your time, talent and sanity all wasted. Just do all you can not to be wasted,” he added.
