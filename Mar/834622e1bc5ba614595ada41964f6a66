Four staff members of Ebonyi State Ministry of Power have been arrested for allegedly stealing diesel meant for powering streetlights in the state. Commissioner for Information and State Orientation Uchenna Orji, who disclosed this on Wednesday evening while briefing journalists, said a disciplinary committee was set up to try, dismiss and prosecute the suspects. Orji added that the owner of the house where the suspects allegedly kept the stolen diesel would pay a compulsory N5m punitive fine or the house would be sealed by government to serve as a deterrent to others.
