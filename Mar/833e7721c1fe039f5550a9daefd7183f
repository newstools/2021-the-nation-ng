 A monarch in Osun State, the Obawure of Ife Tuntun, Oba Olaposi Osunmakinde has alleged that another traditional ruler, the Ologudu of Ogudu, Oba Jimoh Ajayi led thugs to attack his Ile Ife residence on February 24. Oba Osunmakinde made the allegation in a petition to the Inspector-General of Police, and Director of Department of State Security. He claimed that Oba Ajayi destroyed his property and threatened his life. At a briefing in Ile-Ife, Osunmakinde claimed that his counterpart looted his property worth millions of naira before setting others ablaze. “It all started last December, when a rift broke out between the Obaluru Family and Idita Family, two revered families in my community, over land dispute,” Osunmakinde said. “Although the location of the disputed land is outside my jurisdiction, I was called upon to intervene. I said that both families should partition the land between them as a lasting solution.” Oba Osunmakinde said “the Idita family was not comfortable with this arrangement and…connived with one Oba Ajayi and Olaoye Adedoyin, together with some street urchins to launch an attack on the disputed land on February 24, which resulted in the death of one of the men.” Oba Jimoh denied the allegations. “This person in question is my friend and I don’t know why he is doing this. The last time I saw him was January 2020 and I don’t know how I will attack someone I did not see. The case is in the police station and I will leave them to decide,” he said.
