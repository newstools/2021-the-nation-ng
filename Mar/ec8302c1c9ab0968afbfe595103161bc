 A man who allegedly unleashed his dogs on a policewoman in Lagos has been taken into custody. Police said Adeyemi Abayomi let his two dogs loose on  operatives who were on lawful duty at his Itire Road, Surulere residence on Tuesday morning. The policemen were there to invite him over an allegation of threat to life and illegal possession of property reported by one Nneka Regina. The dogs, police said, inflicted bodily injuries on Inspector Atim Umoh, who was bitten in the knees. According to a statement by police spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, both the suspects and his dogs have been arrested and would face legal actions.  He said the Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu frowned at the action of the suspects, restating his commitment to defend security operatives on lawful duty against attacks. “The incident occurred on Tuesday, March 2, at about 11:30am. One Madam Nneka Regina, of 103, Lagos Street, Ebutte Meta, went to Surulere Division to complain against the criminal attitude of the suspect for illegally occupying her property at 115, Itire Road, Surulere, and threats to life. “The police operatives attached to Surulere Division were sent to invite the suspect before he ordered his dogs to attack them.”
