Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has admitted this is the lowest point of his managerial career. Mario Lemina’s goal for Fulham, inflicted a sixth straight home defeat on the Premier League champions on Sunday. It represents the Reds’ worst run in the club’s history. “My boys wanted it. Believe me, they want to win games. I see how much it hurts. It’s easy to judge it that way because Fulham won, so you say they wanted it more. “But I don’t think that’s the problem. I don’t have to stand here and say we’re fighting for this or that,” Klopp said. When asked if it was one of the lowest points in his managerial reign, he replied: “I would wish to say no but yes it is. “That’s not a problem. I don’t always have to have the best times. This team is an extreme team. We were extremely successful and now we have an extreme situation as well but we will fight through.”
