The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha as well as other members of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, will receive COVID-19 vaccine on Monday. A statement by the Director of Information, Office of the SGF (OSGF), Mr Willie Bassey, said the exercise will hold during the weekly national briefing by the PTF in Abuja. “Arrangements have been concluded for the SGF/ Chairman of PTF and members to be vaccinated tomorrow, Monday 8th March, 2021, during the weekly national briefing at 4:00pm,” the statement said. The vaccination of the SGF and members of the task force is coming more than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari and the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo received the jab. Nigeria plans to vaccinate around 7% of its population between 2021 and 2022.
