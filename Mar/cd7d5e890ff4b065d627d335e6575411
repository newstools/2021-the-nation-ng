 Steve Babaeko’s executive-produced documentary, ‘Awon Boyz’ is set to make its debut on Netflix in April 2021. The 38-minute long flick, which was directed by Tolulope Itegboje tells an emotional story of freedom, missed opportunities, love, and self-belief of eight young men. The documentary is scheduled to premiere on Netflix, on Wednesday, April 14, 2021. The documentary, which was originally released in 2019 draws the audience into the life of the people popularly called “area boys”, while also providing a never seen before view of what it is like to live on the streets of Lagos.  Shot over a month across three locations – Monkey Village, a slum in the highly residential area of Opebi, Oshodi, and the New Afrika Shrine, Ikeja, ‘Awon Boyz’ makes history as the first documentary that sees the story of this class of Nigerian citizens being told through a personal, human lens. According to Babaeko, ‘Awon Boyz’ gives the audience a front-row view of what it is like to live on the streets of Lagos. “This story gives the audience a front-row view of what it is like to live on the streets of Lagos. It’s a very insightful piece of art that paints a vivid picture of what life is like on the streets for the people who actually live it. It’s a very important story and we’re grateful that we get to help tell it to the world,” Babaeko said.
