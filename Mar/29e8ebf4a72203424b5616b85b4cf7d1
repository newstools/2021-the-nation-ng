Crystal Palace claimed their first home win since January as Luka Milivojevic’s first-half penalty earned the Eagles all three points against West Brom, whose survival hopes took a further hit at Selhurst Park. Palace captain Milivojevic scored the game’s only goal from the spot after Baggies defender Darnell Furlong was adjudged by the video assistant referee to have blocked Wilfried Zaha’s cross with his arm. Roy Hodgson’s side went close to doubling their lead in the second half but West Brom goalkeeper Sam Johnstone did magnificently to tip Christian Benteke’s powerful effort over the crossbar. The Belgian striker was played through by Zaha not long afterwards but was denied by Kyle Bartley’s last-ditch tackle. The Baggies rarely looked like salvaging a point, their only shot on target coming courtesy of Mbaye Diagne 18 minutes from time. The win lifts Palace above Leeds and Wolves into 11th place, while second-bottom West Brom remain eight points from safety.
