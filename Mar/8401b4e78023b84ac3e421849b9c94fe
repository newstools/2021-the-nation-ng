Nigeria’s premier non-interest bank, Jaiz Bank Plc recorded strong performance in 2020 with 33 per cent growth in the top-line and the bottom-line. Key extracts of the interim report and accounts of the bank for the year ended December 31, 2020 released at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) at the weekend showed that gross earnings rose by 32.6 per cent while profit before tax grew by 33.3 per cent.The strong bottom-line performance enabled the bank to increase net profit, in spite of provision for taxes in 2020 as against tax gain in 2019. Gross earnings rose from N14.71 billion in 2019 to N19.6 billion in 2020. Profit before tax increased from N2.10 billion in 2019 to N2.79 billion in 2020. The bank made tax provision of N278.63 million in 2020 as against tax gain of N332.77 million in 2019. With this, net profit after tax rose marginally from N2.44 billion in 2019 to N2.51 billion in 2020. Earnings per share thus increased from 7.16 kobo in 2019 to 9.46 kobo in 2020.

Jaiz Bank had in a five-year projection made available earlier to the investing public forecasted that it would grow its income and profitability consecutively over the five-year period, with pre-tax profit for the period expected to be about N15.86 billion. The management of the bank had outlined the five-year growth plan of the pioneer non-interest bank, with an assurance that it would sustain year-on-year growth over five-year period. Managing Director, Jaiz Bank Plc, Mr. Hassan Usman, said the vision of the bank was to become the leading non-interest financial institution in Sub Saharan Africa. He said the bank has been positioned to sustain its growth trajectory, pointing out that the bank has the necessary resources to achieve its growth targets. According to the five-year financial forecast, total income was expected to be about N81.17 billion while profit after tax was projected at N11.09 billion for the five-year period. Gross income was expected to rise to N10.07 billion in 2018 and subsequently to N12.59 billion, N15.73 billion, N19.27 billion and N23.51 billion in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively. Profit before tax was projected to rise to N1.33 billion in 2018 and grow consecutively to N2.03 billion, N3.01 billion, N4.03 billion and N5.47 billion in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively. After taxes, net profit would rise to N927 million in 2018 and grow further to N1.42 billion in 2019. Profit after tax was projected to jump to N2.11 billion in 2020 and rise consecutively to N2.82 billion and N3.83 billion in 2021 and 2022. Balance sheet of the bank was also expected to increase over the years.

Shareholders’ fund was projected to rise to N28.6 billion in 2018 and grow consecutively to peak at N35.23 billion by 2022. Shareholders’ return was also expected to grow over the years. Return on equity was expected to firm up to 4.39 per cent in 2018 and improve consecutively to 4.87 per cent, 6.92 per cent, 8.79 per cent and 11.22 per cent in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively. Usman said the bank’s growth strategy of focussing on the real sector, though painstaking, will ensure sustainable growth and better returns over the years. According to him, Jaiz Bank wants to develop small and medium enterprises (SMEs), grow with them and support them not only for profit making but to ensure the country achieves real growth. “We shall continue to internally develop new customers, new markets and new product for both our physical and virtual channels. We remain committed to continuous up-scaling of our governance mechanism to meet the highest operating standards. Cost efficiency is at the heart of our value creation model. We shall strive to be a low cost operator,” Usman said. He noted that while the bank would continue to expand its operations across the country by opening more branches, it will significantly leverage on technology to reach the nooks and crannies of the country and bring the semi-banked and unbanked population into the formal economy.
