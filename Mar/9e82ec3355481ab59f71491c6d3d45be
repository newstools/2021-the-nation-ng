Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Adamawa chapter, Bishop Dami Mamza, has taken his jab of the COVID-19 vaccine. His Muslim council counterpart, Mallam Gambo Jika, also got vaccinated. The leading clerics took their vaccination amidst campaign by government and development partners to sensitise the public on the safety of the vaccine following doubts in some quarters. The Christian and Muslim clerics led their respective executives to the vaccination centre at Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Yola with a charge to their followers the safest way out of the COVID-19 pandemic is vaccination. Speaking to journalists, Mamza and Jika said the World Health Organisation (WHO) had certified the vaccines in use, assuring there should be no cause for alarm. The vote of confidence of the religious leaders was viewed across Adamawa State as a huge advertisement for the Covid-19 vaccine. At a one-day media orientation workshop, chairman of Adamawa State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Bashir Suleiman, said the government called the meeting to discuss public pessimism over the COVID-19 vaccine. The workshop which was supported by WHO and UNICEF, produced a communique which said the meeting ascertained that the vaccines were safe enough not to have caused harm to many people despite the millions who have taken them so far across the world. The communique advised media practitioners against placing too much prominence on ‘negative reporting’ but to promote the encouraging aspects of the COVID-19 vaccines.
