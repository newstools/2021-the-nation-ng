There are indications that Benin Republic will be without the services of Olivier Verdon and Steve Mounié for the AFCON 2021 Qualifiers against Nigeria’s Super Eagles on March 27 in Porto Novo. However, the list of the squad that will face Nigeria will have to wait till tomorrow after coach Michel Dussuyer postponed  its unveiling. According to beninwebtv.com, the presence of defender Verdon in the Squirrels squad for the match against Nigeria on March 27 would be very uncertain even if the player and his Bulgarian club Ludogorets are negotiating to find a compromise that would satisfy both parties. It was learnt that the Bulgarian club fears the health measures of the local authorities which have imposed 10 days of quarantine for all people who land on its territory. To them, this measure would deprive the club their three African players. But negotiations are already underway to have the club at least leave the players for the tie against Nigeria. Also, French club Stade Brestois will not allow Mounié to join the Beninese team according to L’Equipe.
