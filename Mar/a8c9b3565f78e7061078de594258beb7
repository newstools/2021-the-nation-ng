Some ex-militants in Ondo State on Monday protested non-inclusion in the Federal Government amnesty program despite submitting their arms and ammunition. The ex-militants who carried placards of various inscriptions said they were disappointed that they were yet to be integrated into the programme. The spokesperson to the protesting ex-militants, General Ogalo Ibori, said they have been grievously affected by the many years of neglect since their accepted amnesty. He urged President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene and address their situation by properly integrating them into the society since they donâ€™t want to go back to the creek.
