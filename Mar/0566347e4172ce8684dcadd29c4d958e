Chief Tajudeen was abducted on Saturday at Oke – Eri corridor of Ijebu – Ode – Oru – Ibadan road on his way home from Ijebu – Ode. Ogun Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the community leader was released on Tuesday evening after spending four nights in captivity. Oyeyemi said the kidnappers released their victim at 8 :30pm in Ijebu-Igbo after spending four days in the kidnappers den. It was however learnt the kidnappers initially demanded N100 million ransom but collected N5 million to release the chief. But Abimbola said the command was aware of payment of ransom. According to him: “The community leader has been released. The Commissioner of Police, myself and other police officers were in Ijebu-Igbo till about 8: 30 pm yesterday (Tuesday). “I was not aware of payment of any ransom. “The command will never be part of the arrangement because it is dangerous ,it will give the signal that kidnapping is lucrative . “This is not the end of this matter ,we are going after the kidnappers to ensure we arrest them so as to make them serve as scapegoat for others.”
