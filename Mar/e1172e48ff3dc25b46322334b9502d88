Six passengers of two commercial tricycles have been reported dead in a ghastly auto crash involving a towing van and their tricycles. The accident according to multiple sources happened on the Alaoji (Aba) axis of the Enugu-Aba-Port Harcourt Expressway. The driver of the towing truck was said to have driven against traffic on the Alaoji-Aba axis of the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway and on getting on top of the rail-line “flyover” bridge, lost control of the car and rammed into upcoming commercial tricycles. Four of the occupants of the two commercial tricycles reportedly died on the spot while others were injured as a result of the impact of the accident. The driver of the truck in apparent move to avoid possible attack from the mob was said to have jumped out of the vehicle and ran away immediately his car was brought to a halt. Security men and Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) personnel, including sympathisers who thronged the scene of the accident, helped in carrying the injured to the hospital, while the dead were deposited at the morgue. Information later has it that two of the passengers who were among the passengers taken to hospital for urgent medical attention died in the hospital, bringing the number of deaths from the accident to six. While police have towed the truck and the two tricycles to the station, the driver of the towing truck whose identity was yet-to-be ascertained is still at large at the time of filing the report.
