Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) on Monday condemned President Muhammadu’s statement in reaction to the assassination attempt on Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom. HURIWA accused Buhari of pampering Miyetti Allah cattle owners Association: “even in the face of the obvious fact that their activities constitute clear and present danger to National Security interests of Nigeria.” The group which condemned last weekend’s assassination attempt on the life of Ortom also condemned the communication: “by proxy methodology of President Muhammadu Buhari in the face of the constant bombardments of soft targets by terrorists and armed Fulani militia all across Nigeria.” HURIWA asked Buhari to speak to Nigerians directly in person and unfold the practicable panacea and measures being put in place by his government to deal with the increased threats of grave dangers to the lives and property of the citizens. The group in a statement issued by the National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko expressed disappointment that: “the violent attacks on the governor of Benue State at the weekend by suspected armed herdsmen is another dimension in the open threats made by officials of Miyetti Allah association.”
