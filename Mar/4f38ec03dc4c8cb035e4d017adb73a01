  The Founder of One Love Family, Satguru Maharaj ji, has urged the Federal Government to arrest Sheikh Ahmad Gumi for aiding and abetting banditry and terrorism. Maharaj ji, in a statement he signed and issued yesterday, said the utterances of Gumi in a television programme, justifying kidnapping by the Fulani, showed him as somebody aiding and abetting banditry and terrorism. He quoted Gumi as saying in a TV programme that the Fulani were into kidnapping to make money, as they had no civilisation, noting that such justification was uncalled for and dangerous for the peace of the country. “This same personality, Gumi, was on a negotiating table with the Fulani bandit group leader, Dogo Gide and his group over the kidnapped pupils and members of staff of Government Science College, Kagara in Niger State. This is really worrisome.  “Is this not mortgaging the conscience of our youths? Invariably, we are teaching them, it is okay to take arms against the state and that they will be rewarded and given recognition for their grand schemes, twists and plots. “Gumi lacks conscience for going as far as negotiating terms of exchanging prisoners of terror for the lives of innocent school children. “This measure can be likened to attempt to kill a python with fresh eggs. It will only serve as nourishment for it to feed fat,” Maharaj ji said. He added: “We are begging that steps should be taken to arrest him for aiding and abetting banditry and terrorism. “Gumi is not a patriot. His actions and utterances negate our cherished dream of the Nigerian project.”
