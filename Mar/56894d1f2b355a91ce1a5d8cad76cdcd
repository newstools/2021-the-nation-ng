 Nutrition is key to Nigeria ending child and maternal mortality, a Non-Governmental Organisation, the Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO), has said. Its Executive Director, Honestus Obadiora, stated this while speaking at the 2021 International School Meals Day (ISMD) organised by LAPO in Lagos. Obadiora said the theme of this year’s celebration, “Eat for the Health of It” was very apt because malnutrition was one of the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in Nigeria. “We strongly believe that with the support of all stakeholders, we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of reducing maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births and end the preventable death of newborns and children under five years of age to as low as 25 per 1000 live births,” he said. Obadiora, represented by Head, LAPO Western Region, Mrs Sandra Asowata, added that food insecurity, irregular rainfall, access to healthcare and armed conflict were some of the factors that had further worsened malnutrition in Nigeria. “Healthy eating is paramount to boosting our immune system. For young people to achieve and learn in school, it is important that they develop a healthy eating habit, ” Obadiora said. A dietitian, Mrs Temitope Osho, said maintaining an adequate diet and regular exercise was important for all individuals, especially school-age children. She said: “Children are required to eat a variety of foods from each food group to ensure optimal intake of vitamins and minerals. “The essence of a healthful diet is simply making a good choice from the available food. “The right foods in the right combination can reverse a trend towards obesity, diabetes, inflammatory diseases, hypertension, and other chronic conditions that become more prevalent as we age.”
