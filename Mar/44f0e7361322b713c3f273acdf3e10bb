The Nigerian Union of Teachers(NUT) Kwara wing has commended the state government for the transparent and thorough manner with which it has conducted the ongoing recruitment of teachers for primary and secondary schools. In a statement jointly signed by Kwara NUT chairman Comrade Olú Adewara and Acting Secretary Comrade Rasheed Mayaki, the union described the ongoing teachers’ recruitment as a departure from previous exercises. The union expressed confidence the new crop of teachers employed at the end of the exercise will greatly improve the teaching profession in the state and education sector in line with the vision of the present administration. The NUT however advised the state government to carry out a needs assesment of where teachers are greatly needed so as not to defeat the main purpose of the recruitment exercise.
