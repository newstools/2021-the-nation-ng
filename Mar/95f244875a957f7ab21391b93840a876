Police have recovered the body of a newborn abandoned beside the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja. The day-old was found beside Ayinke House on Saturday by the hospital’s security men who notified the police. This was the second case of abandoned day-old baby recovered by police in one week in the state. Police spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi said personnel detailed to the scene suspected that the baby was left there overnight. He said the operatives contacted the state Environmental Health Monitoring Unit for evacuation of the body. “The baby was suspected to have been abandoned by his mother and must have been exposed to risks that caused his death. “The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Hakeem Odumosu has condemned the barbaric act of dumping and/or killing babies with impunity as he ordered the State Intelligence Bureau and Surveillance teams in the command to step up their findings and keep watch on those heartless criminals who engage in such heinous crimes with a view to bringing them to book and curb the act in our society,” said Adejobi. The command, he said, also arrested two suspected armed robbers around 9:30pm on Saturday on the Lekki-Epe Expressway. Adejobi said operatives attached to Ilasan Division intercepted three men on a motorcycle who were suspected to be armed robbers around Jakande but one of them fled. He identified the two arrested as Covenant Okorocha, 28,  and Jeremiah Adigun, 27, both residents of Badagry, Lagos. “One Beretta pistol with ammunition was recovered from them,” he said.
