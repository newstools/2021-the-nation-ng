 The Minister, Industry Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo has emphasised the importance of gas in the realisation of the country’s goal of making the manufacturing sector a dominant job creation. In his goodwill message to the pre-summit virtual conference of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit to launch the Decade of Gas Mandate, Adebayo stressed the need to harness the potential that gas presents for Nigeria’s industrialisation. Represented by his Technical Adviser, Kamal Bakrin, the minister said gas could become a source of competitive advantage for the manufacturing sector. “We believe that gas can become a source of competitive advantage for Nigeria’s manufacturing sector and a strong lever for its positioning as the preferred manufacturing hub in Africa. This is especially important as we implement measures that can leapfrog us to the front of the line as the destination for manufacturing for the rest of Africa,” he said.  He said the sector could be a dominant job creator and source of foreign exchange for the country with an affordable source of gas. The sector has the potential of becoming Nigeria’s dominant job creator, a viable source of foreign exchange and the channel for long term economic security. An affordable source of gas is one of the enablers for realising this vision. Adeniyi added that the ministry has been in deliberations with the Ministry of Petroleum Resources on how to improve the availability and cost of gas for the manufacturing sector adding that he hoped this is one of the issues this conference will discuss and hopefully address.
