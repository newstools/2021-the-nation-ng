Popular On Air Personality (OAP) Ifedayo Olarinde aka Daddy Freeze has vowed to appeal a Rivers High Court ruling that ordered him to pay N5 million for adultery. The court ruled against him for having sex with Benedicta Elechi, who was still legally married at the time of the incident. Daddy Freeze, in a YouTube video, however said the ruling was issued in his absence as he was never served by the court. He said: “Many of you would have been surprised as I was to wake up one morning and see a judgement from a Rivers State High Court. Well, the court never served me, so the judgement was obtained in my absence. “What we will do now is go straight to the Appeal Court. A lot of people are unaware that the judgement is not final until it gets to the Supreme Court. “I’m very confident in the judiciary system, and I do believe that I will receive a fair judgement.”
