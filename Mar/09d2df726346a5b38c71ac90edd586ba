AC Milan will be back in Serie A action at the San Siro tomorrow  as they take on in-form Napoli. The visitors will be looking to move into the top-four with a win on the road this weekend. There isn’t much getting away from the fact that AC Milan now have a mountain to climb if they are to win the Serie A title this season. However, their target at the beginning of the season would have been to finish in a Champions League spot, and they are in a strong position to do just that. They have been able to recover since back-to-back losses by going three without defeat. Milan have won twice during that run of form, and picked up another big win last weekend against Hellas Verona. Diogo Dalot and Rade Krunic scored in the win away from home, which was an excellent defensive display by Milan. They allowed Verona just one shot on target in the game, managed 47% possession and 11 attempts on goal with three of them on target. For AC Milan, the goals were scored by Rade Krunić (27′) and Diogo Dalot (50′). On the other  side, Hellas Verona got 11 shots at goal with only one of them on target. A win this weekend could see them stretch their advantage in the Champions League battle to ten points over Atalanta. Napoli are still in the fight for Champions League football themselves, and have been in decent recent form. They haven’t lost in three games, and like Milan, have won two of their most recent fixtures. The gap isn’t getting smaller between themselves and the top-four though, as they are still three points away from Roma. They do have the added advantage of having a game in hand and a better goal difference though. Napoli beat Bologna in their last game in Serie A. In that match, SSC Napoli managed 43% possession and 14 shots on goal with 7 of them on target. For SSC Napoli, the goal scorers were Lorenzo Insigne (8′, 76′) and Victor Osimhen (65′). Bologna got 16 shots on goal with four on target. Roberto Soriano (73′) scored for Bologna.
