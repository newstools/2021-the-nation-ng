The impeached Deputy Speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Oludare Kadiri, has dismissed his purported removal as an “infraction,” stressing that it is “grossly unconstitutional and illegal.” Kadiri, in a swift reaction to his impeachment which was made available to The Nation, said he was already consulting with his lawyers with a move to challenge the “infraction” that the purported removal represents. He urged his teeming supporters, constituents and members of APC in Ijebu North II State Constituency to remain calm as the issues that threw up this unwarranted action would be sorted out. He said: “I just received the news of my purported impeachment based on the report of an ad-hoc committee set up by the Ogun State House of Assembly. The development, to say the least, was grossly unconstitutional and illegal. “However, I have initiated consultation with my lawyers to fashion out the best possible way to address this infraction. I urge my teeming supporters, constituents and members of my political party in Ijebu North II State Constituency to remain calm as the issues that threw up this unwarranted action are sorted. “In whatever capacity I find myself now or in the future, I remain committed to the ideals of a functional legislature, tenets of democracy and good governance.”
