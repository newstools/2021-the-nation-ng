Police in Anambra have uncovered a baby factory in Otolo Nnewi, the industrial hub of the state. Four expectant mothers were rescued from the brothel where they were kept to produce children for the baby factory owner. Police spokesman Haruna Mohammed said in a statement yesterday that the baby factory owner, one Gladys Nworie Ikegwuonu, presently at large, was behind the recent attempted kidnap of a four-year-old boy by two men on a motorcycle in the area. He said, “On 11/3/2021, there was a report at the Area Command Headquarters, Nnewi that a four-year old child of St Joseph’s School, Otolo Nnewi, was returning home from School in company of his siblings when two men on a motorcycle grabbed the child and zoomed off with him. “The child was rescued by some commercial motorcyclists who pursued and eventually arrested the suspects. Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspects who were beaten to stupor by an mob (one of whom was confirmed dead), were sent by one Gladys Nworie Ikegwuonu, presently at large, who also operates a baby factory and a brothel by keeping young girls and getting them impregnated after which she sells the children to her waiting customers. “Two suspects arrested are Abuchi Ani, and Emeka Ikegwuonu. “Four pregnant young girls were rescued.”
