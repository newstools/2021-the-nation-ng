 Enyimba FC attacking midfielder Cyril Olisema has said that a winning start against Libyan side Ahli Benghazi in today’s opening group A of the Confederation Cup will boost their morale to perform well in subsequent matches.  Speaking ahead of the encounter slated for Enyimba International Stadium, Olisema, who scored Enyimba’s only goal in the elimination of Rivers United in the playoff round, was full of respect for the Libyan side but stood firm that The People’s Elephant would be out for the spoils. “It is going to be a vital game for us since it is the first group match. I think if you want to start good in any competition you have to win your first match that will give you a lot of confidence to go ahead and play in the other games. I think by the special Grace of God we are coming out fully to get the three points, Olisema said.  “I have watched some of their videos which are the past matches they have played. I think they are a very good side and as a North African side, we are not going to underrate them because it’s going to be a very tough game, so we are going to come out fully against them,” he added.
