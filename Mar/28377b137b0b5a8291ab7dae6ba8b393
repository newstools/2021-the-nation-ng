UFC heavyweight world champion Stipe Miocic is eyeing a move into boxing to take on either Anthony Joshua or Tyson Fury. Miocic, 38, will defend his title in a rematch with KO machine Francis Nano at UFC 260 this weekend. But he would then consider switching from the cage to the ring to take on either of the Brits who are due to meet in an undisputed clash this summer. Asked on ESPN why he wanted to fight Joshua or Fury, Miocic said: “It’s a different combat, boxing is all about technique. “It’s more of a fair fight (than if they fought in MMA); we both fight standing but we can kick and take down, and they’re not used to that.” Miocic was first crowned heavyweight champion in 2016 when he knocked out Fabrizio Werder in the first round. He made three successful defences against Alistair Overeem, Junior dos Santos and Ngannou before he was dethroned by Daniel Cormier. Miocic exacted revenge on Cormier before winning their trilogy fight last August.
