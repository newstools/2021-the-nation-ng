The President of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), Kolade Alabi, has reiterated the need for state police. He spoke when he led ALGON executive to visit Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello According to Alabi, the current security challenges could be curbed if there is state police in place. The officers, he said, would be able to quell insurrections in their domain. Alabi called for more allocations to the state and local governments to address challenges of infrastructures and security lapses. He also commiserated with the governor and the people of Niger State on the insecurity which has engulfed the state. He said: “Most worrisome was the senseless abduction of more than 50 pupils on February 17, and most recently on March 8, where 30 villagers were kidnapped by bandits. The trauma that befell the women and children, particularly your good self, was better imagined than going through the theatre of horror. We are thankful for your proactive propensity and to Allah for His exceptional grace bestowed on those victims in ensuring their release without any loss of life.”
