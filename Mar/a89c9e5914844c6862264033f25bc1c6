Not ready to dwell on Super Eagles shambolic display against Sierra Leone in Benin City,  Super  Eagles’  ‘non-playing’ captain Ahmed Musa has said that the team  won’t  put up a laisser-faire  attitude away to  Benin Republic in  the AFCON 2021 qualifiers in Port Novo. Musa  who was included in the squad  as a rallying motivator  to his teammates  according to coach Gernot Rohr,  told journalists yesterday in Lagos that the team is poised to pick the ticket  to the  delayed 2021  AFCON  to be hosted by Cameroon. “A draw in Port Novo is going to qualify us for AFCON but that is not what we are going for; we need to win but you know football anything can happen,”  stated Musa.“We only make mistakes in life once, so we made a mistake against Sierra Leone in Benin City and we are not going to repeat that mistake. “ I am sure that all the boys know the hard work they are going to put into that game against Benin Republic.” On the Nigeria Football Federation(NFF)  plan to ferry the Super Eagles  contingent to  Port Novo via waterways , Musa said: “There is nothing we can do about how we get to Benin  and for us,  I just want them to provide what is going to take us safely down there and then make the players feel comfortable and when we get there we are all ready for the game.”
