Operatives of the Lagos Police Command have rescued a day-old baby abandoned by a bush in Oko Oba. The baby was rescued around 10:30pm on Monday at Oladejo Street, Oko Oba after he was discovered by a resident around 10:20pm. It was gathered that the baby’s cries attracted the attention of a resident who moved closer only to see a newborn by the side of the bush. The resident, according to police spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, alerted operatives at Abattoir Division, who raced to the scene and carried the baby for safety and quick medical attention. Adejobi, in a statement around midnight on Tuesday, said the Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu after receiving the newborn at his office, expressed interest in adopting the child through the Ministry of Youth and Social Development. “The Commissioner of Police Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu has ordered the Gender Unit of the command to hand over the baby to the Child Protection Unit of the Ministry of Youth and Social Development of Lagos State. The unit is presently having custody of the rescued baby. “The Commissioner of Police however expressed his intention to discuss with the Minsitry of Youth and Social Development on processes of adopting the handsome looking boy as soon as possible. “The police boss also urged women, especially young ladies, to desist from this callous act which must be unequivocally condemned by all and sundry in the state and Nigeria at large,” said Adejobi.
