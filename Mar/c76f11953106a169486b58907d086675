Top striker, Paul Onuachu, has vowed to justify his late recall into the senior national team, Super Eagles with goals in the AFCON qualifiers if given the opportunity by Coach Gernot Rohr. Onuachu may have scored many goals for his club, Gents but Nigerians are looking forward to what he would do for Super Eagles in the AFCON qualifiers. “Of course as a striker, you always need to score when you’re called upon and when I have the chance to play, definitely in my head I want to score, but if it doesn’t come, I’ll keep working hard for the next one,” he was quoted by Brila.net. Onuachu was initially overlooked by Gernot Rohr for the qualifiers, despite scoring 27 goals in all competitions for his club this campaign. The lanky centre-forward has bagged 27 goals across all competitions for the Blue and White, including his strike against Anderlecht in Sunday’s Belgian Cup tie. The three-time African champions will take on the Squirrels at Stade Charles de Gaulle in Porto Novo on March 27 before facing the Crocodiles three days later at Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos Nigeria leads Group L of the Afcon qualifiers with eight points and victory over Benin or Lesotho will seal their place at the biennial tournament, scheduled for Cameroon in 2022.
