Officials have said injured Bordeaux winger Samuel Kalu will be replaced by Henry Onyekuru for the Super Eagles AFCON qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho, reports ScoreNigeria.com Kalu was forced out of Sundayâ€™s Ligue 1 clash at Dijon after suffering a thigh injury. Onyekuru was one of seven players placed on standby by coach Gernot Rohr and has been rewarded by the Eagles for his new-found form at Galatasaray.  Over the weekend, he came off the bench to score twice for the Istanbul giants to win 3-0 on the road and stay within striking distance of Super Lig leaders Besiktas. He has so far scored five goals for Galatasaray since his arrival in January on loan from AS Monaco, where he did not enjoy enough playing time. Nigeria visit Benin on March 27, before they welcome Lesotho three days later in final 2021 AFCON qualifiers.
