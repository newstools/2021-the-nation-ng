Law groups in Rivers State have condemned alleged moves by the Rivers, Governor Nyesom Wike, to impose a new Chief Judge. The groups, under the aegis of the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) and the Concerned Lawyers in Rivers State, asked Wike not to approve the recommendation and appointment of Justice Simeon Amadi as Chief Judge. The groups noted the incumbent, Justice Adama Laminkanra, an indigene of Edo State, who retires in May 2021, was appointed by the Governor based on seniority. They recalled Wike had promised to sustain the policy of seniority and precedence in judicial appointments. They wondered why Wike would abandon seniority and precedence to overlook Justice Joy Akpughunum in the list sent by Judicial Service Commission to the National Judicial Council for consideration for appointment. They stated Justice Akpughunum is the most senior judge while Justice Simeon Amadi comes a distant second with Justice Teetito coming third. According to them: “What reasons informed the exclusion of Justice Joy Akpughunum, who, apart from being the most senior judge after the incumbent Chief Judge, is outstandingly brilliant, diligent, fair and most importantly, completely free of any smear of corruption? “Why was the NJC mischievously presented with a fait accompli to make a choice between candidates that by judicial tradition ought to have been considered only after the most senior was found unworthy or unqualified by the NJC?”
