Secretary of the Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe has assured the committee is committed to the June deadline given it by the National Executive Committee(NEC). He however said the committee may approach the party if needs be for more time, which will be obvious to all. “We are committed to the assignment and we sure that June is realizable, but we will not hesitate to approach the party if we need to. This however will be clear to all doubting Thomases, because we have nothing to hide. “All we are doing is to cement the structure of the party. You will recall that there are many groups that came together to form the party, so we have to be united, build the structure for future challenges and guve the cohesion the party needs to win future elections,” he reiterated.
