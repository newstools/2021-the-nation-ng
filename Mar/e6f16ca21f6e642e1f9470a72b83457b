Members of the Kwara State Baptist Conference on Sunday protested peacefully in Ilorin against hijab-wearing in grant-aided mission schools. The protest was held on the premises of the conference headquarters in Surulere, Ilorin. The protesters carried placards such as ‘No hijab in Baptist schools and other mission schools’, ‘Give us back our schools’, ‘Let peace reign in the state of harmony’, ‘No religious violence in Kwara’. The conference President, Rev Dr. Victor Dada, said: “For emphasis sake, we want to reiterate that under no circumstances will we allow the wearing of hijab in our schools. The schools are our heritage and a legacy bequeathed to us by our forefathers. “We are requesting that the state government should immediately reopen our schools without wearing of hijab. “What we are saying is give us back our schools. But if the state government is bent on running the schools, we want to say that we will henceforth not allow hijab in our schools. “If the government’s posture does not allow our children to sit for the Senior School Certificate Examination this year, posterity will judge those at the helm.”
