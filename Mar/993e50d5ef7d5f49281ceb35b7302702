The District Governor-Elect for Rotary International District 9125, Rotn. Ayo Oyedokun on Thursday asked Rotarians to give more to execute projects for the needy in the world. He also urged them to attract more members in order to attain the 1.3m target by the organization. But he charged Rotarians to maintain high sense of propriety and conduct. Oyedokun gave the charge while declaring open a training session for all Club Presidents-Elect in the district in Abuja comprising 21 states in the country. He said: “Let it be known that the songs on our lips or simply put our Must Win Battle would be to: do more, give more, serve more positively, carry out big, bolder, and better projects. “ Our donation to the Rotary Foundation donation  must reach $750,000. We can achieve this if we give more and encourage others. “ Our Club Presidents, | hereby emphasis the charge by the RI President 2021-22 Shekhar Mehta about the singular goal of attaining the 1.3million mark in membership come June 30, 2022. ”  Our membership at the district level  must grow to 6,000. He advised Rotarians to always live above board in whatever they are doing. He added: “Let me tell you that it doesn’t matter who gets the credit. It’s not about the things we do, but about the work that gets done! just imagine and leave your club stronger than you found it. “ In so doing, being prepared and imaginative, We need to embrace the Core Values of Rotary ( Fellowship, leadership, Integrity, Diversity, Service-FLIDS), memorize them and understand that it is vital to our continued service to our Ciubs & District, “ Please let us maintain high sense of propriety and conduct’ and our club would be better of for it.”
