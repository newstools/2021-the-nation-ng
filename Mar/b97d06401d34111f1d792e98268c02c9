Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti, has urged individuals to desist from making money off people’s pain. The Grammy Award nominee took to his Instagram page to express his distaste for people who milk other people’s misfortunes. He noted that a lot of people hide behind their profession to oppress their fellow human beings. “I’m just doing my job is a lame-ass excuse for all these destructions y’all are causing. It’s no longer accepted. Hiding behind your job to promote the oppressors’ agenda is so 90s, we Don wise,” he began. Continuing, Kuti wrote, “Demolishing poor people’s homes. Evicting poor people. Killing innocent civilians because of an order. Polluting the environment. Praise Singing the oppressors. Walking next to the prince of Wales as a prop. We are so on to you!!! Get a better humane job. stop making money out of the pain of people. stop stepping on ur ancestors blood and head as a ladder.” Seun, who has been championing causes against bad governance and societal ills, suggested that it is better to resign from jobs that put anyone in a position to inflict suffering on fellow human beings.
