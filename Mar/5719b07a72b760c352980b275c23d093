 ALL is set for the election of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) Lagos chapter. Following the two-year expiration of the Mojisola Oyetayo aka Mama Ajasco led executive, political activities in high and low places have commenced. While Moji has made her interest to return known, the former chairman of the chapter, Emeka Ibeh aka Emeka Rising, has also indicated interest to run again and his posters are evident. Interestingly, Emeka Rising has strong support in the person of ex-chairman, Don Pedro Agambi. High wire politicking is currently being played including ethnic slant and another ploy. Currently, there is an interim caretaker committee overseeing the affairs of the Lagos chapter of the guild. The committee is headed by top actor, Ken Eromosele Okogbenin, while Amina Ndim is secretary and Fred Idehen -member. The election earlier scheduled for March 13, 2021, has been postponed for a month to enable the probe panel set up to investigate the controversy trailing the removal of two members of the Lagos state chapter AGNEC to submit its report. The panel is headed by Zack Orji.
