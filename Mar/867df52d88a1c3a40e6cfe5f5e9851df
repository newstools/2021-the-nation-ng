Music star Davido has reacted to the victories of his contemporaries at the 2021 edition of the Recording Academy Awards aka Grammys. The 28-year-old singer reacted to Burna Boy and Wizkid wins hours after the 63rd edition of the awards ceremony hosted by Trevor Noah on Sunday, March 14, in the United States of America. “Whichever way you look at it, this is a victory for Nigeria for the culture and for my people! Congrats to our winners! Tule Naija!” Davido tweeted. Burna Boy broke the Nigerian music record at the 63rd Grammy Awards by winning a Grammy award for his album, ‘Twice As Tall.” On the same night, Ayo ‘Wizkid’ Balogun won his first-ever Grammy Award after two nominations. The win came through his duet with Beyonce on the song, ‘Brown Skin Girl’ off the 2019 album, ‘The Lion King.’ Sikiru Adepoju is the first Nigerian to win a Grammy for his performance in an album jointly produced. Burna Boy remains the first Nigeria-based, solo artiste to win the Grammys.
