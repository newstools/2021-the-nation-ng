Mobile Network Operators licensed by the Federal Government to embark on National Identity Numbers (NIN) registration with a view to linking them with the Subscribers Identity Module (SIM) can carry on with the task for the next five years. The Federal Government announced on Wednesday that it has given approval for the extension of their tenure from one to five years. The government was however silent on the April 6 deadline it gave for linkage of NIN with SIM. It only said it would subject the operations of the licensees to “continuous monitoring”. A joint statement by the Director of Public Affairs of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Head of Corporate Communications of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Dr Ikechukwu Adinde and Mr Kayode Adegoke respectively announced government decisions. The statement noted the decision was the aftermath of the meeting of the Ministerial Task Force on the NIN-SIM registration last Friday. The meeting was chaired by Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, the statement added. According to them, some of the decisions reached include: “Approval was given for the extension of the tenure of NIN Enrolment Agent Licenses for MNOs from 1 to 5 years in consideration of their satisfactory performance, subject to continuous monitoring. “This is a deliberate effort of the Federal Government to simplify the enrolment process for Nigerians and legal residents. “The technical committee was mandated to complete the development of a new SIM issuance strategy that cannot be compromised. “This will ensure that there is no repeat of the past process that was compromised through pre-registration by some agents.”
