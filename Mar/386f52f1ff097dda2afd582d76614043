 Many people think that police brutality only happens in America, but it’s everywhere,” says multiple Grammy award-winning singer, Angélique Kidjo. The 60-year-old singer made this known after the release of the visual of her new collaboration with Yemi Alade entitled, ‘Dignity.’ The track, which was produced by a Nigerian producer, Vtek, was said to have been inspired by a protest against police brutality in 2020. “This song is against brutality, but it’s also about how we need to treat each other with dignity, treat nature with dignity, and treat ourselves with dignity. Because if we can’t see the dignity that mother nature gave to all of us, then how can we walk tall?” the Benenoise singer said in a recent statement.  Kidjo, who won her fourth Grammy in 2020, also revealed the reasons behind her decision to work with African young music acts like Yemi Alade. “I’m so proud of this new generation of musicians that are using the technology to tell a positive story about Africa. It’s no longer about our suffering. Everybody suffers. So, why should people be focusing only on our suffering and not seeing just the human beings that we are, and how joyful we are?” she said. In 2019, Kidjo and Alade collaborated on her hit single, ‘Shekere’ which was on Alade’s 2019 album, Woman of Steel.
