Napoli legend Bruno Giordano believes Victor Osimhen would be ‘devastating’ next season while admitting that the Nigerian international’s progress in Italy has been stalled by injuries and COVID-19.
Osimhen marked his return to Napoli’s side with a goal in their 3-1 home win against Bologna in Sunday’s Serie A fixture. The 22 -year-old had missed Napoli’s last three games after he was rushed to hospital following a collision with an Atalanta player last month. But  speaking on Radio CRC’s “Arena Maradona” broadcast, Giordano said: “Osimhen? His impact on Serie A was great, then came those three months in which he was stopped, between COVID and physical problems, but I think next season it can become devastating.
“I am convinced that next year we will see the real Osimhen.”
“Napoli paid for the many injuries,” he added. “Gattuso’s team is still in the running for fourth place, but must find continuity of results, because they have already lost so many points along the way. “There have been many injuries, often even in the same department. But there is still time to remedy.” Meanwhile,  the Nigerian agent Andrea D’Amico, equally  believes with consistency, Napoli would reap from their investment in the striker. “He had so much bad luck, he finally got back to scoring,” D’Amico told Marte Sport Live yesterday .“It will be an extra weapon for the championship finale. He can give quality and physical strength, he is a complete athlete and a very interesting player. Gattuso will be able to exploit it according to the moment that lies ahead.“
