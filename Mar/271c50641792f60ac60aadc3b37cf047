Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors have described Saturday’s assassination attempt on Benue Governor Samuel Ortom as an invitation to anarchy. In a statement on Sunday by the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto, they warned that any attempt to harm any Nigerian will be viewed as an attempt on “all of us”. PDP Governors said: “We believe strongly that any dispute or perceived dispute should be and must be resolved amicably without resort to violence. “Nigeria is not a Banana Republic, even though certain retrogressive elements and centrifugal forces are trying to consign Nigeria into a failed state. “Nobody or group however highly placed should take the laws into their hands, even though some highly placed Federal government Ministers seem to have surrendered to the nefarious activities of miscreants and mischief-maker’s bent on destabilising the nation. Self-help is an invitation to anarchy and must be nipped in the bud”. Pledging their support for Governor Ortom, the Governors said they remained united and would do the utmost to defend the rights and prerogatives of the Benue people that elected Ortom.
