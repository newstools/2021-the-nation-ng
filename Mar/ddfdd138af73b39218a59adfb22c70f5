Veteran Nollywood actor, Pete Edochie, has attributed rising domestic violence against women and broken marriages to feminism. Speaking in an interview with BBC Igbo, the actor stated women are at fault in most cases of domestic violence. He lamented modern women don’t know how to do basic things and keep their husbands happy. This, he said, makes some men unable to control their emotions and beat their wives. Edochie however said he doesn’t ascribe beating women because his mother was never beaten and he has never beaten his wife. He further stated some of the modern trends, which the African men indulge in, were non-existent during his time like kneeling to propose to a woman. He insisted the African culture does not allow for worshipping of the women just like in the western world. He reiterated the fact that he is not a woman-hater but one who adheres strongly to culture, especially the African culture.
