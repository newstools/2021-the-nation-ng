A High Court in Akwa Ibom sitting in Ikot Ekpene has sentenced a 31-year-old man, Edidiong Pius Ototi to death for killing his father, Pius David Ototi, whom he accused of being a wizard. The court presided over by Justice Augustine Odokwo on Monday found Ototi guilty of murder. Justice Odokwo ordered that Ototi be hanged by the neck until he died, praying God to have mercy upon his soul. He said the prosecution team from the state Ministry of Justice proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence. Edidiong Ototi had admitted in his confessional statement at the Police Headquarters, Ikot Akpan Abia, that he killed his father and buried him inside a pit toilet on November 18, 2018. Justice Odokwo, in a one-hour judgment said, Ototi had no right under the law to take the life of his 60-year-old father, whom he accused of being responsible for the untimely death of his two grandchildren. The accused quoted Bible portions, begging the Judge to forgive him and temper justice with mercy.
