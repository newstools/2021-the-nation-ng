The House of Representatives on Friday said that there was need for urgent reforms at the ports if the country hopes to get maximum benefits from the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). Speaking at a public hearing on a bill to repeal the Export Prohibition Act, Chairman of the House Committee on Commerce, Hon. Femi Fakeye, said that the many tariffs and unnecessary bureaucratic bottlenecks at the ports makes it difficult for exporters to export their goods out of the country. Fakeye said that in a bid to address the bureaucratic bottlenecks at the ports, some Nigerians have devised ways of sneaking their products to neighbouring African countries from where, the goods are exported overseas. He said: “why we are hemorrhaging in Nigeria is the civil service. We have layers of tariffs you have to clear at the ports. Whether you are importing or exporting even when what you are exporting is perishable. “Peoples that have found ways of beating all these red tape and get their yam to their friends across the border in Ghana are doing a lot of business. “I want to appeal that we do a lot of reforms now that we have AFCTA. We will not be able to fight back or win dollars back unless we reform how we do things at the border.”
