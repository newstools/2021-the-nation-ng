Nigeria ‘s  Quadri Aruna will now focus on making his third appearance at the Olympic Games through the world ranking  after he lost yesterday to Russian Vladimir Sidorenko at the on-going World Singles Qualification Tournament (WSQT) in Doha, Qatar. Seeded number two behind England’s Liam Pitchford. Aruna fell to  the Russian sensation in an energy-sapping 4-2 (11-3, 11-13, 11-6, 9-11, 4-11, 7-11) encounter that ended his bid   to pick a  ticket to Tokyo  from WSQT. “It was not what I expected but all hope is not lost as I am still the second -rated player in the world among the ranking of those who  are yet to pick their ticket to Tokyo,” a disappointed Aruna said. “For now, the ranking will remain like this as there are no tournaments again until May when the final list would be made public.  I will continue to train in readiness for the games as I only need the final confirmation from ITT to be listed for Tokyo 2020,” noted. Though nine places were up for grabs at the WSQT taking place at the Ali Bin Hamad Al Attiya Arena in Doha,  the loss saw Aruna missing out of the  four spots reserved for the men from this particular competition. The competition  was  hosted and organised by the Qatar Table Tennis Association (QTTA), under the auspices and authority of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).
