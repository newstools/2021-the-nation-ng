 An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, on Wednesday, remanded a 39-year-old man, Clement Chidi in Kirikiri Correctional Centre for allegedly robbing a policeman. The defendant was said to have carried out the robbery, using a knife to rob the police officer of his identity card. The Magistrate, Mrs O.A. Layinka, who did not take the plea of Chidi ordered that the file should be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for advice. Layinka adjourned the case until May 3 for mention. The defendant, who resides at Oyingbo, Lagos, is being tried for armed robbery. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp. Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on March 6 at Apapa Road, Ebute-Meta, Lagos. Ihiehie said that the defendant armed himself with a double-edged knife and robbed Cpl. Joel Samaila of his police ID card. “The defendant approached the complainant, pointed the knife at him, snatched his ID card and ran away. “He was later apprehended and taken to the station,’’ the prosecutor told the court. He said that the offence violated Section 297 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the section attracts 21 years imprisonment for armed robbery.
