 LA Campagne Tropicana Forest River Beach Resort in Ikegun Village, Ibeju Lekki, Lagos, is known as a resort that always welcomes important personalities who come to experience nature and unwind. But it was a different feeling entirely when Governor of Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, visited the world-class but indigenous resort on Friday, March 19. The governor originally toured the Lagos Free Trade Zone on the Lekki corridor but he still found time to chill at the resort. And the moment Sanwo-olu and his team entered the gate of La Campagne, it became a carnival-like atmosphere as the management team led by its President, Otunba Wanle Akinboboye, put up a fascinating performance so as to give Sanwo-Olu a day to remember. Atunda Entertainment treated the governor and his team to classy presentations of musical instrumentation, choreographed Zulu Dance and singing. The lady talking drummer and songstress, Ara Thunder’s performance was the icing on the cake. Sanwo-Olu was modest and his security protocol officers were receptive too. Performers, guests and staff of the resort had a rare opportunity to take all kinds of photos with the number one citizen of Lagos. The governor spent close to three hours. Sanwo-Olu commended Akinboboye for keeping faith in his passion, which had kept him going since the reaction of the resort. He said:  “I am sure that a lot of you don’t know that he is Wanle and also I am sure a lot of you have not heard about La Campagne on Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja. That was where it all started. I was a young man like a whole lot of you or maybe even much younger. He started from a building on Adeniyi Jones and that was our amusement park then because it was a wonderful park at that time. But over the years, he moved here. I have been here before and I have slept in your chalet here many times. But coming here this evening, this place has changed a lot for the better.”
