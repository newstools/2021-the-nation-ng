The ex-national president of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), Adekunle Mokuolu, has urged the government to make use of engineering human resources that are being wasted, to lift 100 million people out of poverty as promised by President Muhammadu Buhari. He gave the advice while delivering a lecture titled: “Quality Engineering Education and Practice for Sustainable Development and National Security”, to commemorate this year’s World Engineering Day, organised by the Lagos branch of the NSE, at the University of Lagos, Akoka. Mokuolu said:  “Engineering is the pillar on which the world can thrive because our activities should support the planet. We will not experience what is called national disaster like earthquake if engineering technology is put into use.” He added: “Instead of borehole drilling, which drains the underground water meant to absorb the shock of the movement of the earth, we can have treatment plant and reservoir from our natural water like the rainfall and river.” Mokuolu said Nigerian engineers are resources to the government and they should be used to contribute to the growth and infrastructural development of the country. The Chairman of the Lagos branch of the NSE, Ayotunde Ogunnoiki, said the World Engineering Day is an annual event during which engineers around the world come together to see how far they have gone in the practice of engineering.
