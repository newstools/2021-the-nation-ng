Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni on Sunday took his first jab of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Governor Buni, who took the vaccine from his personal physician Dr Mohammed Salim Umar was keenly watched by the Commissioner for Health, Dr Mohammed Lawan Gana. His Deputy, Idi Barde Guban, who is the Chairman of the COVID-19 Task Force Committee in the state, the SSG, Baba Malam Wali, his Chief of Staff, Abdullahi Gashua, his Director-General Media and all other members of the State Executive Council also took the vaccine at a ceremony at the Government House, Damaturu, the state capital. Though the frontline workers in the state have started taken the vaccine about two weeks ago, with more than 4,000 of them being vaccinated, the vaccination of Governor Buni yesterday marked the official flag-off of the vaccination exercise in the state since the arrival of the vaccine in the state on March 10. After taking his jab, Governor Buni enjoined everyone to take the vaccine and continue to maintain all the basic protocols associated with the Coronavirus. “I have just received my COVID-19 vaccine with members of the State Executive and my personal aides. I encourage everyone to receive the vaccine. I also encourage everyone not to forget the COVID-19 protocols. “We should continue to listen to pieces of advice from experts concerning the virus,” Governor Buni said.
