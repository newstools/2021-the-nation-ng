  Nigerian equities continued on the downward trend yesterday as investors continued their portfolio realignment across the sectors. Benchmark indices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) indicated average decline of 0.22 per cent yesterday, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N45.3 billion.

Aggregate market value of all quoted equities dropped from its opening value of N20.221 trillion to close at N20.176 trillion.
