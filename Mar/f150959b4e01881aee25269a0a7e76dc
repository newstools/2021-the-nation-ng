The Federal High Court in Katsina presided over by Justice Hadiza Shagari has ordered detention of Kaduna- based business mogul and cybercrime suspect, Mahadi Shehu, in custody of the state CID until Friday, 12th March 2021. The Nation reports the decision to remand the suspect in CID custody was to enable the court entertain or otherwise the yet to be written and submitted application by the defense counsel seeking his bail, which is to be argued on the adjourned date. Speaking during an interview with newsmen after the court sitting which lasted for about five hours, the lead prosecution counsel, Barrister Simon Lough, noted the defendant has made several publications on his Facebook account and granted interviews with Television and Radio stations, accusing Kaduna Governor Bello Masari of embezzling public funds, which after all his allegations were found to be false. He further disclosed the defendant was asked to produce documents to back up his allegations, which he was unable to before his arraignment. He said: “By the provisions of the cybercrime act; it’s not bailable in recognition of the penalty and looking at the circumstances surrounding the case”. On his part, the lead defense counsel Barrister Mustapha Abubakar described refusal by the complainant, who is also the Inspector General of Police, to release the defendant on bail in compliance with a court order as flagrant disobedience of a valid court order. The Nation had reported the Katsina State Government dragged Shehu before the court on February 4, 2021 for making unfounded allegations of embezzlement of public funds.
