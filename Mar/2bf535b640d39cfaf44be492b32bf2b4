NO fewer than 72 percent of Nigerians are ready to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the African Center for Diseases Control (Africa-CDC). The centre, quoting from a report released by the Partnership for Evidence-Based Response to COVID-19 (PERC) Consortium in Addisa Ababa, Ethiopia, said two-thirds of Africans interviewed expressed willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines. It revealed levels of acceptability across the continent as follows: Nigeria (72 per cent), South Africa (61 per cent), Zimbabwe (61 per cent),Â  Zambia (53 per cent). Others are Mozambique (75 per cent), Egypt (78 per cent), Kenya (59 per cent), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (52 per cent). The consortium is made up of public health organisations, including the Diseases Control and Prevention; Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies; and the World Health Organisation.  Others are the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; the World Economic Forum as well as private sector firms such as market research company, IPSOS. The report said the sentiment varied across the continent in the 19 member countries surveyed, adding that 91 per cent of the people surveyed in Morocco were most interested in receiving the vaccines. It said Tunisia and Cameroon had the lowest number of people, at 35 per cent. The survey was part of the third series of data collection and analysis from PERC with combined results from phone surveys on the impact of Public Health and Social Measures (PHSMs) with information on epidemiological trends, media monitoring and data on population mobility. Dr Emmanuel Agogo, the Nigeria Country Representative of Resolve to Save Lives, outlined the reasons for vaccine hesitancy identified in the research to include lack of enough information on the vaccine, negative and unsubstantiated reports on the adverse effects of the vaccine, among others. He urged the media to take responsibility for enlightening audiences.
