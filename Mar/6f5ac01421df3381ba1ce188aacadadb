True to the prediction of its owner, Ottasolo Football Club, are the team to beat at the on-going Nationwide League One competition with a commanding five wins in as many matches at the Ilorin centre. Club owner Gabriel Davies, a former  Stationery Stores defender, hinted  ahead of the season  his desire  to see Ottasolo  hitting the ground running  in only  their  first season  in the country’s  third tier league. “We sat down to plan all the logistics of running the club and that was why we made impact even in our first tournament during the  Governor Wike pre-season tourney in Port Harcourt. We are here to stay and not  only eager for results but our target is to do the right thing,” he noted. Ottasolo seemingly  carried  their pre-season form  to the Ilorin Township Stadium where they  have brushed aside other contenders including victories over Abu Workers  of Kaduna (4 – 2); FC Ebiede(3-0); United Kaduna (2-0); Vet United of Jos ( 2 – 1) as well as a hard-fought 1-0 win over Ekiti FC  yesterday. Ottasolo now  lead their section with the maximum 15 points   after winning their first five  matches  and are expected to keep their unbeaten run when they tackle hard-fighting Remo FC  at the same venue today. “So far, so good for us,” Ibrahim Waheed Olagoke, an official of the club, said. “But we are not going to rest on our oars and we just want to keep winning our matches.”
