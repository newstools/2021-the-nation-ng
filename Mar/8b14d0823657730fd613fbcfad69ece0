 Secretary to the Lagos State government (SSG) Mrs Folashade Jaji, has appealed to Lagosians to renew their trust in the ability of the police to manage information. This, she said, will aid the fight against crime. She spoke during Stakeholders’ Parley on Safety and Security for Lagos East Senatorial District at Hadassah Event Place, Ojota, Lagos. The event had in attendance, various groups including traditional and community leaders, traders, youths, and other pressure groups. Mrs Jaji was responding to allegations by the participants that the police exposed them to criminals whenever they were given information. This, the participants, said exposed them to danger. The Secretary to the State government, however, urged them not to renege, rather be tactical in releasing such information. According to her, there are ways to send information to the police without making your identity known.  “We need to make use of the technological advancement in doing this. Once you have genuine information, you can hide your number. What the police need is the information and not necessarily the informant. They can use that to prevent crime from taking place,” she said. She stated that information is key to cracking criminal activities. She urged parents to ensure their children are morally brought up. “We can make the society better by inculcating the values that made our own period peaceful. Mothers are failing in their responsibility,” she said The state government, she said, was committed to securing the lives and property of the people. Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) Lagos State Chairman, Apostle Kehinde Showemimo, said the alarming rate of the crime was worrisome. According to him, the security agencies are over-stretched in securing the communities.
