A Karu Grade I Area Court on Wednesday, ordered a 25-year-old tailor, Yesmin Abdullahi, to sweep the court premises for two weeks for stealing a pack of Milo, chocolate malt beverage. Abdullahi, who resides in Gwarimpa, Abuja, pleaded guilty to criminal trespass and theft and begged for leniency. The judge, Inuwa Maiwada, did not give Adullahi an option to pay the fine. Maiwada warned him to desist from committing crimes. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Vincent Osuji, told the court that the complainant reported the matter at the Karu Police Station on Feb. 10. Osuji said the convict entered Fordmart Supermarket and stole a pack of Milo, worth N2,100. He said that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 348 and 288 of the Penal Code.
