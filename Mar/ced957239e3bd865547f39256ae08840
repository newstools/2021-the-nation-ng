The Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Mohammed Babandede, has said they intend to remove passport processing from the country’s High Commissions and embassies. He said they intend to establish facilities far away from the embassies that would be known as visa processing centres. Babandede said this was a global practice, especially in view of security challenges to carry out the process in embassies. He said the same is already being done for visas and they were working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to effect this. He spoke at a two-day public hearing on the alleged incessant malpractices associated with diplomatic postings and deliberate draining of resources in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs headquarters and at the Missions organized by the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs. “We are doing that for visas in the UK, where it is processed at Fleet Street. Why can’t we take passports to Fleet street? We want to move passport front offices from the embassies. We are already talking with Minister of Foreign Affairs to effect this,” he said.
