The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State on Sunday said there is no plan to foist undemocratic structures on the local governments. It said it is ready for council poll whenever the umpire blows the whistle. APC Publicity Secretary Seye Oladejo said in a statement that the allegation that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was planning to entrench undemocratic structures was unfounded. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart, Taofik Gani, said since the governor was planning to fester anarchy at the grassroots, the major opposition party would resist it legally. Gani said: â€œThe voice of the major opposition party in the state is coming on the heels of statements credited to some chieftains of the APC in the state that local government election will not hold and that caretaker committees shall be set up at the local government level. Oladejo, however, said there will be an election and PDP will be defeated like in the previous elections.
