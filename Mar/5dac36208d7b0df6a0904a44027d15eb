To assess the threat of insecurity and its impact on schools, the Niger Ministry of Education has directed the closure of all public secondary schools for two weeks. The schools are to close from Friday, March 12th to Friday, March 26th, 2021. According to Commissioner of Education, Hajiya Hannatu Salihu, the closure was to give relevant security agencies the time and opportunity to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of all public secondary schools. This decision was taken during an emergency consultative meeting with leadership of the Association of the Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS), Association of Model Islamic Schools (AMIS), Executive Chairman, Niger State Universal Basic Education Board (NSUBEB), Heads of Education Agencies, Directors of the Ministry and other stakeholders of the sector. The Nation had reported during the wake of the Kagara school abduction, 22 secondary schools comprising 11 day and 11 boarding schools were closed in local government areas declared hot insecurity zones in the state. Salihu stated that the comprehensive risk assessment exercise, when completed, will provide an all-inclusive mechanism and strategies that will restore and guarantee sustainable security and safety of students, school infrastructure, education managers and teachers. She called for the understanding and support of education actors, parents and communities while reiterating the governmentâ€™s resolve to leave no stone unturned in ensuring all schools in the state are safe environments for effective teaching and learning.
