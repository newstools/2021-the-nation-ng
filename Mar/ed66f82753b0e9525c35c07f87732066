A 23-year-old ex-convict, Taiwo Sunmonu, has been arrested by operatives of the Lagos Police Command for alleged armed robbery. Sunmonu, the police said, was arrested around 11:30pm on Saturday at Ijanikin while he and others were robbing victims at Ajayi Street, Oto Awori. According to a statement on Sunday evening by spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, Sunmonu was released from prison in November after serving a five-year jail sentence. While other members of the robbery gang fled, Sunmonu was apprehended by policemen who responded to a distress call in the neighbourhood. “The suspect has confessed to the crime and other crimes he had participated in. After the arrest, one locally-made pistol and live ammunition were recovered from him,” said Adejobi. The spokesman also said one George Bankole, a brave armed robber victim who wrestled with his attackers submitted a gun and cartridges he got from them to the police.
