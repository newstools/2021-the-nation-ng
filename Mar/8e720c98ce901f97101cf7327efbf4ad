The much postponed  Edo National  Sports Festival  will  go ahead as planned from  April 2nd- 14th with 8,000 athletes  taking part, Minister  of Youth  and sports Development.  Sunday Dare has assured. Speaking in Benin on Friday after undergoing a tour of facilities and a meeting  with  Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki,   Dare said: ” On April 2nd, 2021, the camp for the Edo Festival  would be opened, on April 6th the official opening  of the Festival by Mr President  would  take place.  But, beyond that, we are also working closely with the PTF, NCDC and others to ensure that the necessary support we need in terms of vaccination of athletes, test kits will be available. We are also toning down the number of athletes that would be participating from 14,000 to 8,000. I must thank the Governor and his Deputy Governor for taking the lead on this.” On accommodation of athletes, he said:” We have been able to get the University of Benin to host our athletes. There is still some work to be done here which may not be in the radar, but everything is on track I can tell you with certainty that the Edo National   Sports Festival will hold.
