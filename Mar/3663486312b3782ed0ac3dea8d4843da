Sanwo-Olu said: “In the last couple of years, we have built strong foundations and this fiscal year, we increased our budget on education from eight to twelve per cent. We invested in curriculum development through EKOEXCEL to change the learning outcomes from our schools. “We believe a solid foundation for our children starts with qualitative primary education hence our deliberate focus on primary school education and reform. “Our administration will continue to increase investment to bring up the standard of education across board”. The programme has been widely endorsed by educators across the state. Lagos NUT Chairman Hon.
