The Executive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied sending advisory to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) against selling forms to aspirants for 2023 general election. He said he has not asked INEC to stop dealing with aspirants with files before EFCC. A statement by the Head of Media and Publicity of EFCC, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, said Bawa clarified that it was not within his mandate to determine who should run for an office. He said he has not made any pronouncement relating to 2023 poll since his appointment. The statement said:  “The attention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been drawn to a report currently circulating in the social media, in which the Executive Chairman, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, is quoted as having advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency, pursuant to the 2023 general election. “The Commission wishes to state that the report is false as the Executive Chairman has neither met with INEC officials nor made any pronouncement remotely related to election since he was appointed. “All he has said, in his two public outings so far,  pertain to issues concerning his vision for the EFCC and the outlook for the fight against corruption in Nigeria. “Qualifications for elective political offices in Nigeria are clearly stated in the 1999 Constitution and relevant sections of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). “It is not the place of the EFCC chairman to determine who runs for an office or otherwise. Members of the public are therefore enjoined to consider this report as another classic case of fake news and discountenance it.”
