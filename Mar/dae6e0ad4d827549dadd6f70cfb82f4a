The Lagos State Judicial Panel of Enquiry and Restitution for Victims of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS)-related abuses and other matters has extended its sittings by three months. The panel was inaugurated by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on October 19, 2020 with a six-month mandate. But its chairman, Justice Doris Okuwobi, said the extension was essential to allow the panel adequate time to hear the deluge of petitions it had received. The panel was set up by the state with a N200 million kitty in the wake of the near-nationwide protests against police brutality under the hashtag #EndSARS. It is also hearing petitions concerning last Octoberâ€™s shooting incident at the Lekki Toll Gate. Petitioners have accused the army of shooting at and killing some protesters, a claim the military denied.
