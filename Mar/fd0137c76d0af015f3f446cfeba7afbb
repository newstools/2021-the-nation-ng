  The board of directors of Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc has recommended payment of a dividend per share of 25 kobo to shareholders as return for the 2020 business year. The dividend recommendation was part of the highlights of the audited report and accounts of the bank for the year ended December 31, 2020, released at the weekend at the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited. The results showed modest growth in key income lines and significantly improved fundamentals, notwithstanding a constrained operating environment largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The audited report for the year ended December 31, 2020 showed that the bank recorded growths across key income lines with net income after impairments rising by 8.3 per cent from N95.5 billion in 2019 to N103.4 billion in 2020. Profit before tax also rose by 2.8 per cent from N24.7 billion to N25.4 billion. The overall performance was largely driven by the growth in loan book, with 23.8 per cent increase in gross loans to N736.7 billion in 2020 as against N595.3 billion in 2019. The bank’s customer deposits hit a milestone during the year, crossing the N1 trillion mark to N1.13 trillion from N886.3 billion, an increase of 27.1 per cent. Low cost deposits were up by 17 per cent, constituting 68 per cent of total deposits helping to push cost of funds down by 1.4 per cent. Chief Executive Officer, Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc, Emeka Emuwa, said Union Bank’s investments in technology and building a progressive work culture over the past eight years enabled a swift response to the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed its workforce transition to remote working while maintaining the productivity required to deliver the strong set of results recorded in 2020. According to him, the bank’s strong set of results, notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19 on its operations and the wider economy, enabled the board of directors to continue to return value to shareholders with a proposed dividend payment for the second year in a row. “This demonstrates the strong foundations we have built, as we continue to deliver against our target of becoming a leading financial institution in Nigeria,” Emuwa said. Emuwa noted that the pandemic accelerated trends in customer behavior which led to rapid increase in digital adoption with a 38 per cent increase in active users on the bank’s UnionMobile channel with total active users now at 2.9 million.  “Our UnionOne and Union360 platforms for businesses grew by 11 per cent from 25,000 users to 27,700 users. Ninety four per cent of transactions in the bank are now done digitally, up from 89 per cent in 2019. We also aggressively grew UnionDirect, our agent network, by six times from 3,100 to 18,100 in line with our focus on our retail business. With our investments yielding positive results, we are well positioned as a strong leader in the retail and digital space,” Emuwa said. He said the bank will in 2021 focus on enhancing revenues and shareholder value by revving up customer acquisition, engagement and transactions through seamless customer journeys and an optimized service delivery platform. “As I retire following eight years of rebuilding and repositioning this storied institution, I am convinced that with the excellent management team and a clear strategy in place, Union Bank is well positioned to continue to compete and deliver value to its shareholders,” Emuwa said. Chief Financial Officer, Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc, Joe Mbulu said the bank was pleased with both its top and bottom-line performance in 2020, in the light of the impact of the pandemic and economic challenges. According to him, significant inflationary pressures and the translation of currency depreciation drove growth in cost base, however the bank maintained strong control, limiting operating expense increase to 10 per cent from N70.8 billion to N77.9 billion, well below the rate of inflation. Consequently, the bank saw marginal increase in its cost to income ratio to 75.4 per cent from 74.1 per cent. He pointed out that the bank continued to proactively manage its growing risk asset portfolio and recorded better asset quality, with non-performing loan ratio improving from 5.8 per cent to 4.0 per cent. “This achievement, combined with a solid capital adequacy at 17.5 per cent and continued top-line growth, provides the platform for strong growth going forward. We will continue to grow our loan portfolio in 2021, which we expect to be a significant driver of growth, combined with our value chain synergies across our business which will drive customer and transaction growth during the year and beyond,” Mbulu said.
