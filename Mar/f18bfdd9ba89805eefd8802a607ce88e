The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has expressed optimism in taking over from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) come 2023. Its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, stated this during an interview on Arise TV monitored by The Nation. He said: “In one zone out of six, we are having contestation of power that is leading towards disagreement which is already being reconciled by the Sen. Bukola Saraki-led reconciliation committee. “Our party is a hope of Nigerians as we speak today. The acts of terrorism, banditry, kidnapping have subsumed our nation… It shows clearly that Nigerians are thinking of who will rescue our nation “The PDP is ready and prepared to take over the mantle of leadership through the ballot box in 2023.” He noted that the feud between Former Ekiti Governor Ayo Fayose and Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde is being resolved by the Saraki-led committee. He said Saraki has met with Ogun PDP party leaders, Ekiti leaders and various interventions are being made within the party. He noted that rising level of insecurity, banditry and mass abduction of students show there is need for foreign mercenaries.
