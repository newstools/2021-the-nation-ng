Former national chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Alhaji Abubakar Baraje Monday said that the party’s defeat at the 2019 elections has been a big lesson for the erstwhile ruling party in the Kwara state. “If we learn from that lesson, 2023 will be a walkover for PDP in the state, but PDP needs to put its house in order. We don’t have to wait till it is the eleventh hour,” he said. Baraje added that all members of the party in the state including former Senate President Bukola Saraki, had been taught a greater lesson by the loss. He said this in Ilorin, Kwara state capital at his inauguration as the Chairman of the state’s PDP ‘Reconciliation and Engagement Committee.’ Other members of the committee include Senator Rafiu Ibrahim, Hon. Ishola Balogun- Fulani, Comrade Bisi Fakayode and Alhaji Dabarako Mohammed, Sheikh AbdulAzeez Uthman, Alhaji. Atanda Zoro, Mr Moses Awan, Alh. Gene Adamu, Hajia Sikiratu Anako, Hajia Ibrahim Masu Jenatu, Hajia Sarat Adebayo, Comrade Adefila, Mr S. B. Abdulraheem, Mr Sabi Musa, Comrade Muhammed Nurudeen, Mr Abdulrahman Abdullahi Kayode and Dr Ruth Abiola Adimula. Alhaji Baraje added that Kwara is a DPD state, noting that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) now in the saddle came to power by default.
