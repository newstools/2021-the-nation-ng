As this year’s World Poetry Day approaches, the Dawn Project Nigeria is planning its programme to further deepen the consciousness of more Nigerians on matters of environmental conservation through poetry and art, notwithstanding the restrictions caused by COVID-19 pandemic. It would be recalled that the United Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) sets aside the 21st of March every year as World Poetry Day and since inception it has continued to use the occasion to promote and support poets and poetry around the world. The Dawn Project initiated a poetry and art competition that targets children and adults alike. The goal was simple; everyone has to be part of the solution to the environmental problems and climate realities that are threatening the very existence of mankind. In a statement, Dawn Project Nigeria said COVID-19 restrictions will not stall this year’s programme even as it said environmental conservation will help halt spread of COVID-19. “We are working on making more of an impact to get more Nigerians to join in the fight to save our environment,” the group said.
