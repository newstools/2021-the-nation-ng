Everton’s European hopes were dealt another blow as their Goodison Park struggles continued with a hugely disappointing result against performance against Burnley. The damage was done in a sloppy opening period that saw Burnley go 2-0 up thanks to Chris Wood and Dwight McNeill. Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed the Toffees back into the game before the break, but they could find the equaliser. It means Everton missed the chance to move into fifth place and within two-points of fourth-placed Chelsea. Carlo Ancelotti’s side have repeatedly demonstrated the capacity to recover from home disappointments this season but after beating Southampton at Goodison Park a fortnight ago will be extremely disappointed to take nothing from this meeting with Burnley. Everton weren’t wanting for effort in their pursuit of an equaliser during a second 45 minutes that quickly settled into a pattern of home pressure, intermittently released by Burnley counters. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored Everton’s goal after 32 minutes, bulleting a header past Nick Pope, but, by then, Ancelotti’s team were chasing the game. Everton stay sixth, with 10 games remaining, but know they must summon their ability to strike back from disappointment and hit the ground running when returning to Premier League action in three weeks.
