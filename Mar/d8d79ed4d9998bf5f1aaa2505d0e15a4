Another unidentified young man has been killed by suspected cultists at Udu Harbour Market in Udu council area of Delta state. The Nation gathered that the incident occurred early Wednesday morning. Details surrounding the incident were not clear as of the time of filing this report. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the incident may not be unconnected to Tuesdayâ€™s killings within the Local Government Area. The Nation had reported that three persons were reportedly killed in Owhase and Ovwian communities in a suspected cult clash. Media aide to the Udu council chairman, Henry Obus, said he will get back to this reporter, as his boss is away in Abuja for a conference. However, he was yet to do so as of the time of filing this report. The Delta State Police Command could not confirm the incident.
