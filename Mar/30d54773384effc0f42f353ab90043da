A Federal High Court in Lagos has fixed June 2 for the arraignment of two Italians, Paolo Prono and Gianfranco Albertazzi, on forgery and conspiracy-related charges. Justice Mohammed Liman set the date on Wednesday, following the men’s second consecutive failure to appear before the court to take their plea. The arraignment, which was first scheduled for last February 18, could not go on following their non-appearance. Prono and Albertazzi were charged by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (OAGF) alongside their company, Borini Prono & Company and one A. Prono, who is said to be at large. The AGF alleged that the defendants forged a Nigerian businessman’s signature and his firm’s documents. A Federal High court sitting in Port Harcourt, the Rivers Sstate capital, has remanded a Dutch couple, Mr and Mrs Peiter Borremans, in a Port Harcourt correctional centre for alleged fraud. Borremans and his Nigerian wife Nkechi allegedly swindled two companies Jackkyson Multi Services Limited” and “Alot General Services Limited of the sum of $330,000. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which arraigned the couple, said they committed the offence under the pretext of purchasing marine tanker vessels for them.
