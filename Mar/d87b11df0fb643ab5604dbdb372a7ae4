The chief executive officer of Monimichelle, Ebi Egbe . has berated Harrison Jalla for saying   there  was  nothing to celebrate over Amaju  Pinnick’s membership of FIFA council. Egbe wondered why some of the nation’s football stakeholders were  hell-bent on rubbishing the country and pulling down whoever rises to the top echelon of world football from the country. He said: “Jalla is definitely not working in the interest of our dear country. When you criticize constructively we  know but we also know when one is only being jealous, vindictive and unpatriotic.” Egbe who is a FIFA licensed match agent said what every Nigerian owe Pinnick now is prayers and total support just the same way we support other Nigerians that have made it to the top in other global bodies like the United Nation, World Trade Organization, Africa Development Bank and even with the  Grammy award  winners. Pinnick Friday  was elected into the FIFA council at the CAF  General Assembly  in Rabat, Morocco where South Africa’s Dr. Patrice Motsepe emerged as new CAF president.
