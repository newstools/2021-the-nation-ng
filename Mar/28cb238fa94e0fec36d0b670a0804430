Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has fired his Commissioner for Environment, Dr Igbiks Tamuno. The governor in a terse statement by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, directed the sacked commissioner to submit government’s documents and property in his possession to the Permanent Secretary in the ministry. Though reasons behind the sacking were still sketchy, it was gathered that Tamuno was holding a press briefing at his ministry when he got wind of the development. “He was holding a media event at his ministry but suddenly he stood up and left the venue. We were wondering why he left in that that until we discovered that he had been sacked,” a source said.
