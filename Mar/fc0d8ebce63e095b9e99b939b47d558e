Customers of Titan Trust Bank Limited, have expressed excitement as the lender pays an extra N5 for every dollar received into their domiciliary accounts or as cash over the counter. Adaeze Udensi, the bank’s executive director, said the decision aligns with the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN’s ‘Naira 4 Dollar’ scheme to encourage the inflow of diaspora remittances into the country. The scheme runs from March 8 to May 8. While commending the CBN for the scheme, Udensi noted: “Titan Trust Bank is passionate about its customers and everything we do is centred around giving them more.” Titan Trust Bank was formed to take advantage of the identified gaps in the Nigerian banking sector and address the unmet needs of the retail mass market, SMEs and corporates.
