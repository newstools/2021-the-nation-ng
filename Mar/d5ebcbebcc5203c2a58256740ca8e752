Super coach Gernot Rohr  said he was aware of the near invincibility  of Squirrels of Benin Republic ahead of  the crucial Saturday’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Port Novo. The German, speaking  in a n interactive session with the media at the Eko Hotels camp of the  Super Eagles in Lagos, said the Beninese will be tough  to beat at home giving the fact that they  have enjoyed an eight-year  unbeaten run. Since losing 1-3 at home to Algeria in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, the Squirrels are  yet to be beaten at home in all competitions  but Rohr hinted  this  record would surely be tested by the Super Eagles on Saturday at Stade Charles de Gaulle in Porto Novo. “You will expect a Super Eagles team that wants to play good football at first and a team that will want to show Nigerians that they are fighting for their country and they are able to do well in Port Novo where we are playing against the team that has not lost a home in the last eight years,” Rohr  frankly said. He continued: “The Benin Republic team has not lost a match in any competition at home since 2013 when they lost 1-3 against Algeria in a World Cup qualifier. So it is a big challenge for us to go and to try to win. “But we know that with one point, we will qualify. So let us play for qualification or winning but without stress if we are not winning, if it is a draw, we will still qualify. “But if at all we lose, we still have another plan to win the match in Lagos against Lesotho and qualify,” Rohr noted.
