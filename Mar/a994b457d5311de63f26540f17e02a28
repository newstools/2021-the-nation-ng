A member of Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), popularly called the Shi’ites, was shot dead yesterday during a clash with the police in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The incident, according to an eyewitness who is also a member of the IMN, Yahaya Soje, occurred when members of the group gathered in Abuja for a peaceful protest to mark the birth of their leader, Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky. The procession, Soje said, started in front of the office of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in Maitama, where the police opened fire on the protesters. One of the protesters was hit and was said to have died instantly while several others were injured. The identity of the deceased could not be immediately established. The injured, Soje said, were taken to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. Reacting to the development last night through a statement by the FCT Police spokesman Yusuf Mariam, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), the command said: “The FCT Police Command on Monday, March 29, 2021 successfully restored calm at Maitama after professionally dispersing a violent protest by some members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), the Shi’ites. “Unfortunately, the members of the disbanded sect went on a rampage, destroying public property and attacking innocent citizens, including police officers with stones and other dangerous objects. “In view of the above, the command wishes to state that it will not condone any form of attack on its personnel, equipment or other public property. “The command implores residents to remain calm and law-abiding while reaffirming its unwavering commitment to the protection of lives and property within the FCT.”
