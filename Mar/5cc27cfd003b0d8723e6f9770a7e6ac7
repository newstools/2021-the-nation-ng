Operatives of the Lagos Police Command have arrested one Anita Harrison over the alleged mistreatment of the body of an accident victim, Nofiat Idowu. Harrison, the police said, allegedly knocked the deceased with her Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) on March 3 at Ikeja and eventually dumped her corpse along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway after she was confirmed dead at a hospital she was rushed to. Parading the suspect Monday, Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu said her action was inhuman, considering the fact that she drove past more than five police stations where she could have reported herself in a case of Road Traffic Accident. He said the suspect would be charged to court for the offences committed, adding that police investigation would reveal if there was intent to commit murder. The Nation gathered that Harrison was arrested following the ingenuity of the hospital where she rushed the victim to. It was gathered that the hospital had taken pictures of her vehicle and the body when it was brought in dead without her knowledge. Similarly, the command said it arrested seven suspects over the murder of a Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) official, Segun Obazu, at Anthony Bus Stop last week. He identified the suspects as Alaba Adepoju, 44, Ayodele Yusuf, 25, Yusuf Waris, 21, Oladele Adejobi, 32, Ridwan Ramonu, 25, Babalola Femi, 23, and Ayomide Oyeniyi, 28. “The case is under investigation at the State CID, Panti, Yaba and the suspects will soon be charged to court,” he said.
