Ekiti Governor Kayode Fayemi has mourned former Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Bode Olowoporoku, who passed on Wednesday after a brief illness. Fayemi, in a condolence message by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, described the late Minister as a brilliant economist and politician as well as a dogged fighter who contributed immensely to the creation of Ekiti State in 1996. The deceased served as Commissioner for Economic Development in the old Ondo State and Minister of Science and Technology in the Second Republic. He later represented Ekiti South Senatorial District between 2003 and 2007. He bagged his PhD in Development Economics from the University of Manchester in 1975. The Governor stressed Olowoporoku, alongside other prominent Ekiti monarchs, scholars, politicians, and community leaders spent resources, time and energy and embarked on several journeys to the nation’s capital to ensure that Ekiti State was created. Fayemi described the death of the notable politician as a huge loss not only to Ekiti State but to Nigeria as a whole, adding that the deceased made his mark as an economist and statesman. He described the late Olowoporoku as a man of many parts – a colourful politician, philanthropist, philosopher, scholar, policy formulator and a big-time farmer.
