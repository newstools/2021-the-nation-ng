The Lagos Police Commissioner (CP) Hakeem Odumosu on Monday said the command has taken steps to prevent farmer-herder clashes in neighbouring Ogun State from escalating to Lagos. He said steps have also been taken to prevent cases of kidnappings and other violent crimes, noting that the command was monitoring happenings across the country and constantly reviewing its security arrangement. Odumosu said this during an interview with reporters at POWA Hall, Ikeja, before his meeting with Area Commanders, unit heads and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs). Many communities in Yewa local council of Ogun State including Ketu, Eggua, Oja-Odan, Igan Alade, Gbokoto and Ijoun, Owode-Ketu, Ebutu Igbooro and Imeko Afon were recently deserted with victims fleeing to Benin Republic following deadly fights between farmers and herders. To prevent a spillover into Lagos communities bordering Ogun, Odumosu said the command had since engaged all stakeholders in those border villages on the need for peaceful co-existence. “We had a security summit in Ikorodu for people in all those Ogun border communities. All the ethnic groups were represented and at the end of the day, there was an agreement on the need to give peace a chance. “Also, we have put in place measures like we did during the COVID-19 lockdown. We have ensured that for those border areas, there are levels of checks. Vehicles are stopped and thoroughly inspected before they are allowed in. So, we have always been proactive in Lagos. “We know that the rainy season is around the corner and so, I want to interact with my DPOs and Commanders on the need to stay alert. We are aware of schools that are being attacked and we cannot fold our arms in Lagos because it is not happening here. “We will continue to brainstorm the issues between now and after two months we will change the strategy to move the state forward and further reduce the crime rate that Lagos is experiencing now.”
