The Plateau State Police Command Police is currently engulfed in shock and disbelief over the alleged shooting and killing of a truck driver by a police officer in the state. The unfortunate incident, which happened around 7.30pm, Thursday, at Railway Crossing, Kuru, along Mararaba Jama’ar – Riyom Road, left a motorbike belonging to a revenue officer burnt down by aggrieved motorists. A police officer from the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the corpse of the truck driver has been deposited in a mortuary in an undisclosed Hospital, while the truck with Ogun State registration number GBE 49 ZC is in police custody. “The officer, who shot and killed the driver, has been arrested and taken to the CID for detention, while investigation into the incident is ongoing. “The three officers at the Kuru Railway crossing that day were on a ‘Pin Down Operation’ but how that incident happened still remains a surprise,” the officer explained. Another source, one Shehu Ibrahim, a revenue officer, with the Plateau State Internal Revenue Service (PSIRS), who confirmed the incident, said he was beaten up by aggrieved motorists, who vented their anger on him and his colleagues.
