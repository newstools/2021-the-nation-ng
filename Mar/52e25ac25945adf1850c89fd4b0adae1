The Federal Government has faulted Transparency International (TI) recent poor rating of the fight against corruption, saying the organisation has been using incorrect indices to rate Nigeria. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, gave the verdict on Wednesday while speaking to State House Correspondents after the week’s virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The Minister was responding to a question on TI’s recent unsavoury verdict on Nigeria’s anti-corruption crusade and management of recovered assets. Mohammed said TI had failed to make use of available data on Federal Government’s various reforms and other preventive steps, all focused on making a success of the anti-corruption crusade. According to him, the Federal Government had taken a look at TI’s ratings and criticism of the administration’s anti-graft crusade and had discovered despite all moves made over the years, the international organisation’s details of its rating of Nigeria had been constant for ten years. He emphasised how important Nigeria considers TI’s opinions and ratings but indicated what had been pushed out about Nigeria’s corruption perception index in the last few years were not real reflections of what is on ground, insisting much had been done to change the influence of corruption in the country.
