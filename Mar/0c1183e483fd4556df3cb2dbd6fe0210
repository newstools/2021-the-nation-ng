Tiger Woodsâ€™ road to recovery has finally taken him home. The golf legend announced Tuesday that he is backing home in Florida, where he will continue his rehab following his terrifying car accident near Los Angeles that left him with extensive leg injuries. Woods thanked his medical team at both the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for their care. Woods had previously been hospitalized since Feb. 23, when his SUV hit a sign on a winding residential road in Rolling Hills Estates, crossed over two lanes of oncoming traffic and rolled into a gully. Woods, who showed no sign of impairment during the crash, reportedly does not have any memory of the crash. It is going to be a while before Woods can even swing a golf club, much less play competitive golf again. He sustained several significant injuries during the crash, including compound fractures of both his right tibia and fibula that required the insertion of screws, pins and a rod into his leg.
