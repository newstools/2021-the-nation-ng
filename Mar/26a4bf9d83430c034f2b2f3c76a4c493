Kelechi Iheanacho  is not giving up on  scoring another hat-trick for Leicester City after the Nigerian netted a stunning trio of goals in City’s 5-0 triumph over Sheffield United. After twice being assisted by Jamie Vardy, either side of the interval, the 24-year-old  completed his first hat-trick for the Club with a stunning hit from 25 yards out at King Power Stadium. Now on 10 goals in all competitions in 2020/21, five of which have come in the last three games, the former Manchester City striker is keen to build on his excellent form for Leicester. “Hopefully, I will get more – more goals and more hat-tricks,” he explained. “I need to concentrate now on the performances. “That’s the most important thing, improving myself in training, and improving in the things I don’t do better, so improving in all aspects, in all areas, in training, to improve game by game and hopefully they will keep coming and hopefully we’ll get to the top.” After footage emerged on social media of his team-mates’ delighted response to his hat-trick, Iheanacho also pointed to the spirit which exists within the Leicester City camp this term. “I think they are all happy for me,” he said. “Everyone is all emotional today, I saw they were happy for me. I scored a hat-trick today so they’re really happy for me. We’re like a family in there, so I’m really happy I’ve got these lovely guys as my team-mates.”
