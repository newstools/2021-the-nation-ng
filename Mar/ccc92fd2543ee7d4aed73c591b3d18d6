African Alliance Insurance has continued to fulfil obligations to customers with the payment of claims of N967 million in the first 40 days of the 2021 business year, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the 61-year-old insurer, Joyce Ojemudia has said. In a statement, Ojemudia stated the company will renew its commitment to fulfilling obligations to stakeholders. She said: “Paying claims as due is non-negotiable. Indeed, the bedrock of a sustainable insurance business is a mutually beneficial arrangement where the insured and the insurer both stick to their obligations to each other without fail. “Specifically, between the first of January and now, we have paid about N148.2 million to 155 individual life customers, N307.5 million to 141 Group Life claimants, N124.1 million to 168 Takaful claimants not forgetting some N387.3 million to our annuitants. “We won’t shirk our responsibilities; we have promised to remain with our customers for life; we will not relent on our oars as we continue to excite our policyholders.”
