The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) has said it had started paying the contractors it owed N1.5 billion. The government agency explained that though payment had begun, it would only be made to contractors who had completed their jobs and had been verified in the Zuba and Guzape sites of Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). FHA Managing Director/Chief Executive, Senator Gbenga Ashafa, announced this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. Ashafa said the management remained committed to the dictates of public accountability, which require the verification of work done before projects are paid for. The statement by the agency’s Head Public Affairs, Kenneth Chigelu, reads: “This is to notify our stakeholders and members of the public that the management of the FHA has begun the payment of contractors who have completed their jobs and have been verified, in both Zuba and Guzape sites in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. “This is in keeping with resolution reached at the meeting between the management and the representatives of the contractors on Tuesday, March 16, 2021. “It is important to note that the authority, under Ashafa remains committed to the dictates of public accountability, which require the verification of work done before projects are paid for. “Management wishes to use this medium to assure stakeholders and partners that the authority would continue to hold in high regard the existing strategic partnerships in order to deliver on its mandates to the Nigerian populace.”
