A four-man armed gang has reportedly abducted a businessman in Aba, the commercial nerve centre of Abia State. The Nation gathered that the victim identified as Mr. Kenechukwu Okeke, an Indigene of Ogbunike, Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State, but resident in Abia State was kidnapped at Umuozuo village in Osisioma LGA of the state. The gunmen were said to have trailed the victim whom they whisked away as he was waiting for the gate of his house to be opened by his family members. The kidnappers are yet to make contact with the family of the victim at the time of filing the report. Sources within the area who spoke anonymously told our correspondent that kidnapping has been on the increase in the last few months. They, however, called on security agencies in the state to ensure that they nip the rising security challenges in the LGA in the bud. The Police Command Public Relations Officer (PPRO) couldnâ€™t be reached for comments at the time of filing the report.
