Maduka Okoye is endearing himself to the heart of  Super Eagles  fans  as the country’s national team’s number one goalkeeper but the Germany-born Nigerian admitted that Nigerian foods and music are part of his integral. The 21-year-old Sparta Rotterdam goal stopper noted  the Eagles are in good form to challenge Benin Republic away in Port Novo in the AFCON 2021 qualifiers. Okoye, indeed, could  not hide his soft-spot for Nigerian food and music despite being born and bred in the Teutonic ways. “I think it is in my blood. I love Nigerian music and food and I miss them any time I leave Nigeria. And when I am about to visit I am always looking forward to it and really happy to be at home in Nigeria,” he admitted. Okoye who has been on the radar of Dutch champions Ajax  is not carried away by the number one tag in Eagles, saying: “I will keep learning the rope and hopefully I continue to improve with each game for the national team.  “I just kept moving having gotten a trust from the coach and that is why I was working hard and as soon as I got the chance,  I took the number one spot “I have what it takes of  to be number one because I am still young but I am going to learn and learn. “Hopefully, I can be the established number one for my beloved country,” he said. For the tie against the Squirrels of Benin Republic, the former Dusseldorf of Germany star believes apart from the quality of players in Eagles, the coaching crew led by Rohr have been the pillars of the team. “Of course we are expecting good performance from the team and I; and I think we are in good form coupled with the fact that we have a good coach on our side and we are not worried to win this match against Benin on Saturday,” Okoye said.
