Fear has gripped residents of Amanze and Amainyi communities in Ihitte Uboma Local Government Area of Imo State after the decomposing bodies of a young woman and a young man were discovered inside a big sac at a bush path within the axis. The communities are a border area between Ihitte Uboma and Obowo council areas of the state. The bodies of the unidentified victims were discovered by villagers going to farm during the weekend following an offensive smell that emanated from the path where they were dumped. It was gathered some of the vital organs of the victims such as their eyes, breasts and other private parts were missing and the hair of the woman shaved off. The decomposing bodies could not be easily identified as their skin layers were already peeling off. Also, their genitals and eyes were harvested making it difficult to identify the dead. The bizarre discovery has caused panic in the two communities. The alarming aspect, according to villagers, was that there were no reports of missing persons within the area. Anxious villagers believe the victicms might have been killed in the nearby Umuahia, the Abia State capital, by ritualists and their bodies brought to the area to avoid prying eyes of the public and security agents. The spokesman of the Police Command, Orlando Ikeokwu has not responded to inquiries by The Nation on the incident.
