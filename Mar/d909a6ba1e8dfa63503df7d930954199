 Former England international Chris Sutton believes Kelechi Iheanacho has earned Brendan Rodgers’ trust as Leicester City plan for life after Jamie Vardy. Iheanacho took his red-hot form to new levels on Sunday as he blasted a hat-trick in the Foxes’ 5-0 trouncing of Sheffield United. Having been back-up to Vardy for so long, Iheanacho is finally emerging from the City legend’s shadow and is proving he can be a key player under Rodgers. The former Blackburn Rovers and Norwich City striker Sutton has been hugely impressed by Iheanacho’s emergence this season. “I have to say, he was unplayable at times [against Sheffield United],” Sutton told BBC Five Live Football Daily. “And I’m not just talking about his goals, but his link-up, his understanding with Vardy and Perez. And this is probably what he needed, a run of games to really kick him into life.  “And that certainly bodes well for Brendan Rodgers and for Leicester City because he may be the one now. “Vardy is going to go – eventually he’s going to be too old, and he is irreplaceable. “But he [Iheanacho] has done himself the world of good with his performances of late, and maybe there’s something now in Brendan Rodgers’ mind where he thinks ‘I absolutely can trust him.’” Leicester City have recently lost two of their most creative players to injury in James Maddison and Harvey Barnes, but Iheanacho has stepped up to maintain the Foxes’ goal threat and top-four push. With two of his strikes against Sheff Utd set up by fellow forward Jamie Vardy, the Premier League’s record goal scorer, Alan Shearer, highlighted the relationship between Leicester’s front two as he named Iheanacho in his Team of the Week.
