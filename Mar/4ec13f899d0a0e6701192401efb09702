The House of Representatives has mandated its Committee on Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to carry out a comprehensive investigation on the deteriorating state of public infrastructure in Abuja. The Committee is to report back within two weeks for further legislative action. The resolution followed a motion by Yusuf Ayo Tajudeen on the deteriorating state of public infrastructure in Abuja. The lawmakers were concerned that despite yearly budgetary allocations to the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) for the maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrade of infrastructure, “the FCTA and relevant agencies have serially exhibited gross inefficiency, outright ineptitude and apparent non-commitment to their responsibilities.” The House noted that Abuja, which is recognized by various local and international peer review organisations as the most-modern, top quality and pace-setting events and conference hub of Africa, is now experiencing an all-time low in terms of infrastructure and environmental development. It also noted that in and around the nation’s capital, infrastructure decay in roads, un-channeled drainage systems, uncleared debris, damaged and blocked manholes, ineffective street lights and non-functional traffic lights are common features. The lawmakers were concerned that the growing infrastructural decay within the city, if left unchecked, may lead to vagaries of health, social and security challenges amongst residents and visitors who come in large numbers on a daily and regular basis.
