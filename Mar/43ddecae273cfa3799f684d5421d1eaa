Benchmark indices for the Nigerian equities market showed average decline of 1.74 per cent at the weekend, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N358 billion for the week. Investors appeared to have found new opportunities in increasing yields in the fixed-income market, especially in sovereign issues with almost zero default risk. Portfolio adjustments in recent weeks have seen equities trading mostly in the red, in spite of the onset of earnings season. Under the extant rules, quoted companies on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) are required to submit their annual results not later than 90 days after the end of the business year. Most quoted companies use the Gregorian calendar ending December 31 as their business year. Thus the deadline for the submission of the 2020 audited report and accounts is March 31, 2021. Several companies have submitted their results and dividend recommendations showing resilience and steady performance, a trend that market pundits had expected to stimulate price rally during the earnings season. However, the yields at the debt market, especially on sovereign debt issues have been rising steadily in recent months, counteracting the positive impact of the earnings season. Analysts at Cowry Asset Management said they expected the market to continue on the decline as investors stay on the side lines to target new support levels. “However, a decline in stop rate, especially for 364-day at the primary market auction, in the new week, may change trading dynamics in equities towards the end of the trading week,” Cowry Asset Management stated. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities said the sell-offs was due to profit-taking in stocks that had rallied significantly before the beginning of the earnings season, with investors opting to take their funds to fixed-income market. “With investors leaning towards the fixed income space, sentiment is expected to remain bearish in the near term. However, we believe this presents investors with attractive entry opportunities in the equities market, Afrinvest Securities stated. Analysts at Cordros Securities also expected the bearish trend to continue noting that investors were cherry-picking dividend-paying stocks and, at the same time, exhibit reluctance in leaving gains in the market. “With uncertainties about the direction of yields in the fixed income market still bugging investors’ minds, the bears are likely to retain dominance in the market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks share prices at the NSE, closed weekend at a recent low of 38,648.48 points as against its opening index of 39,331.61 points for the week. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also dropped correspondingly from the week’s opening value of N20.578 trillion to close weekend at N20.221 trillion. The decline worsened the average year-to-date return to -4.03 per cent. The momentum of activities also slowed down considerably with total turnover dropping to 1.675 billion shares worth N23.541 billion in 21,732 deals last week as against 2.092 billion shares valued at N29.744 billion traded in 24,238 deals two weeks ago. The financial services industry led the activity chart with 1.20 billion shares valued at N10.272 billion traded in 12,518 deals; thus contributing 71.64 per cent and 43.64 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The consumer goods industry followed with 110.564 million shares worth N3.577 billion in 3,234 deals.

Sectoral analysis showed that the negative overall market position was largely due to losses in the highly influential banking sector. The NSE Banking Index dropped by 5.75 per cent, neutralising gains recorded in the insurance, oil and gas and consumer goods sector. The NSE Industrial Goods Index declined marginally by 0.05 per cent. Losses in the banking and industrial goods sectors depressed the NSE 30 Index- which tracks 30 largest stocks, to close the week with negative return of -2.20 per cent. Meanwhile, the NSE Insurance Index rose by 2.84 per cent. The NSE Consumer Goods Index appreciated by 2.18 per cent while the NSE Oil and Gas Index inched up by 0.59 per cent. There were 35 gainers against 38 losers last week compared with 14 gainers and 71 losers recorded in the previous week.
