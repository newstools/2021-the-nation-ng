By Daniel Adeleye  The Company and Allied Matters Act also known as CAMA 2020 signed into law in August 2020 by president Muhammadu Buhari, has been adjudged as a robust framework for reforming identified onerous legal, regulatory and administrative bottlenecks which, for three decades, have made doing business in Nigeria substantially difficult particularly for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and impeded investments into Nigeria. Speaking at a webinar interactive meeting organised by Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC and the European Agents for Citizen-Driven Transformation Programme EU-ACT, the Director, Board Secretariat CAC, Mr Justine Nidiya stated that CAMA 2020 was a combined effort of the international community, the organised private sectors and corporate practitioners, according to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Nidiya revealed that CAMA 2020 which became substantive since January 1st, 2021 has generated a lot of interest and controversies among the public, especially among the civil society actors, was meant to help all businesses and CSOs thrive better in new ways.
