 Joy Ubeku started her career as a Nollywood actress before leaving the shores of Nigeria for Ghana where she has become one of the most sought-after models strutting the runway, and touring the world. The leggy Ubeku who just finished filming a new feature, ‘Shadows of the Night,’ has been flying the Nigerian flag high strutting the runway of international fashion shows. From Malawi to Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Liberia, Italy, Dubai, Palestine, South Africa, Russia, and Seychelles, Ubeku has registered her abilities as a leading fashion model.  Speaking on her incursion into modeling and her experience working with international designers, Ubeku said, “I have always wanted to be a model but I never gave much importance to it. So, after my first beauty pageant, I had the confidence and push to realize my dreams.” On her experience, the UNILAG graduate said, “I remembered walking for this Designer after being rejected by one, and the same week she had massive orders for that same outfit. That feeling supersedes all the racism/rejections I faced while on that journey.” The Niger-Delta-born Ubeku also noted that she hopes to launch a clothing line soon while continuing movie making.
