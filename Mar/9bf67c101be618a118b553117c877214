Ahead of the party primaries for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, stakeholders of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) are drumming support for one of the contestants, Mr Godwin Ezeemo. During a meeting of the stakeholders in Awka at the weekend, they urged the PDP delegates to ensure emergence of Ezeemo as the gubernatorial candidate of the party. The reason, they said was because Ezeemo, had invested in all sectors in the state, including agriculture and publishing. They said the aspirant was the only one with a capacity to dislodge the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) from the state government house One of the pillars of PDP in the State, Chief Christopher Udoye, adviced the delegates not to allow moneybags to hijack their governorship primary so that the will of the people would prevail. Also, Hon. Ibuchim Ezekwelu and Chief Dan Igbokwubili, said the aspirant, apart from playing the politics according to the rules, had over a thousand staff in all his industries in the state alone, aside from relating well with all.
