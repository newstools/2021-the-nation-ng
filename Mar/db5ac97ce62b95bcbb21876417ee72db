By Bassey Anthony, Uyo Militants under the umbrella body of Unyekisong Akwa Ibom have asked all multinational oil companies operating in the state to vacate with immediate effect. A statement by the leader and deputy of the group, General Dede Udofia and Major Ibanga Ekang, respectively, said the vacation notice became necessary due to unwholesome atrocities perpetrated by multinational oil companies in oil- producing communities. Unyekisong Akwa Ibom is a coalition of freedom fighters in Akwa Ibom State comprising former members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the Niger Delta Volunteer Force, Movement for the Actualisation of the Niger Delta Republic, Niger Delta People’s Salvation Force, Niger Delta Avengers, Niger Delta Liberation Force and Niger Delta Movement for Justice and Niger Delta Warriors. The statement expressed displeasure over what it described as passive response of the current administration to constant cries and yearnings of the suffering masses from these communities whose sources of livelihood, property and lives have been completely destroyed as a result of the operations of the oil firms. They alleged: “The oil companies have totally abandoned their Corporate Social Responsibility which shows that they came to Akwa Ibom State in order to worsen the condition of the already deprived people of the region instead of development. “At this juncture, UNYEKISONG wishes to inform the affected companies that since they are not prepared to work in accordance with the provisions of the Local Content Act and Corporate Social Responsibility, we therefore warn them to immediately evacuate all the innocent workers from their operational bases and rigs both onshore and offshore within our territorial waters to avoid casualties and damages.”
