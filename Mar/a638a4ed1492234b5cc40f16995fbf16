We know what you are ‘surely against’ Now tell us what you are ‘surely for’ Left one day, right another Your compass is a welter of spurious points   You blow so hot this minute The very next you are cold and curt Your word is a two-edged sword Sharp and blunt in a common sheathe   The talking drum that you sometimes are Your front and back never sound the same The world surely needs clever legs For the dance to your dizzying beat   Dawn or dusk, dusk or dawn The world hardly knows How to grasp your day Your sun never stays in one sky   Sometimes okala Sometimes okolo Most times okala-okolo Kala-kolo confusion, ache in the ears   Fork-tongued cobra Viper in the vine We know what you are ‘surely against’ Now tell us what you are ‘surely for’
