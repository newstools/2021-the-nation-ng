Commissioner for Health Prof. Akin Abayomi gave the update for March 16 yesterday on his verified Twitter account @ProfAkinAbayomi. Vaccination started on March 12 at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Yaba, with 88 other accredited centres in the 20 local government areas starting on March 15. “I encourage Lagos residents to be readily available for vaccination, just as Mr. Governor @jidesanwoolu, frontline workers and I have been vaccinated. It is our personal and collective responsibility to be vaccinated to prevent the severity of third and fourth waves of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. The commissioner added that bed occupancy in public and private COVID-19 care centres has reduced from 60 per cent to eight per cent.
