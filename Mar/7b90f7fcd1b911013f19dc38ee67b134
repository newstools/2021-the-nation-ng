The Governor made a final financial commitment for the adoption of the UK -based athlete after a meeting with the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare in Benin. Eraiyokan, a specialist in 400m and 4×400m relay is one of Nigeria’s current fastest quarter-miler and could be the anchor for Nigeria’s medal hope at the Olympics. The athlete expressed appreciation to the Minister and the Edo State Governor for the confidence reposed on him, assuring that he would not let the country down. The athlete is expected to compete for Edo State at the National Sports Festival which holds from April 2 to 14 to fine tune preparations for the Olympics. Several athletes were on the verge of being adopted last year before covid-19 pandemic led to the shutdown of businesses and sporting activities. The Adoption program is an initiative of the minister to secure funding for athletes to enable them prepare for the Olympics. Meanwhile, the minister yesterday received the COVID-19 vaccine with an assurance that it was safe and effective. He said: “I have received the vaccine in order to reassure our athletes, officials and indeed all Nigerians that it is safe, effective and we must all key unto it. Apart from aviation, entertainment and tourism, sports was the worst hit by COVID-19. “ “We had to shut down National Sports Festival few days to commencement, the Olympics was also postponed. The players, officials and fans were affected. Now that we are back on track, all the protocols put in place like wearing of mask, hand washing, use of sanitisers and social distancing must be respected. We must take all precautions so that the virus does not spread.”
