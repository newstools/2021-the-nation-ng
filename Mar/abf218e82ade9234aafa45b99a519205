The All Progressives Congress (APC) Women Leader and Executive Director, Business Development, Nigeria Export Import Bank (NEXIM), Stella Okotete, has felicitated with Nigerian women as the World marks International Womens Day (IWD). In a statement on Monday, Okotete stated that in line with the theme of the year that she has chosen to challenge violence against women and gender bias. She also called on her fellow women to stand up for each other and not see themselves as competitors, but as supporters. The statement reads in parts: ”I chose to challenge violence against woman and gender bias and I call on women to stand up for each other. We must not see ourselves as competitors, but as supporters, because every woman is your sister and you should treat her accordingly. “As we celebrate ourselves today as always, I wish that more women realise that helping another woman win, cheering her on, praying for her or sharing a resource with her does not  take away from the blessings coming to them. “Infact, the more you give, the more you recieve. Empowering women does not come from selfishness, but rather from selflessness.” Okotete organised a visit to GUI ward at Lugbe, visit to women with disabilities and to widows and a virtual meeting with topic: Women in Leadership, Challenges and Solutions among other events lined up.
