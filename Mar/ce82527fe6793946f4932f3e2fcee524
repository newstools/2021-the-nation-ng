Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde has directed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to return the cost of nomination and expression of interest forms to those who lost in the party’s primary for local government election. General discontent had trailed the primary among those who lost in the election, which held across the state last week. Makinde gave the directive to assuage ill-feelings among party faithful who had hoped to secure certain positions in the local government election slated for May. The last elected chairmen and councillors under the Oyo State chapter of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) also condemned moves to organise an election while both parties await the decision of the Supreme Court on the propriety or otherwise of their sack by Makinde on May 29, 2019. The Governor’s directive for a refund was contained in a statement by the State Secretary of the party, Alh. Wasiu Adeleke. The statement reads: “This we believe will strengthen the strong bond we share as one big happy family and we believe that our party will win all the 351 wards and the 33 local government councils we have in the state. “The process to refund the money will start by refunding all our female aspirants this week and others will follow. “We enjoin all our party members to continue to mobilize, support and do all they can to ensure that the party continues to grow stronger and better.”
