The National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Program (NTBLCP) Wednesday launched the “Check Am O!” campaign, a new integrated multimedia campaign to promote testing and treatment of Tuberculosis (TB) across Nigeria. According to a statement by Mrs Itohowo Uko, Director/Head of ACSM NTBLCP, in Abuja, the campaign will be broadcast on television, radio and social media and have volunteers working within communities to promote free testing and treatment of tuberculosis across the country. The campaign was developed under the leadership of the NTBLCP through a coalition of international and local partner organizations, with financial and technical support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the USAID Breakthrough ACTION-Nigeria project. According to the former National Coordinator of NTBLCP, Dr Adebola Lawanson, “For too long, Nigerians with TB have suffered to find the right treatment. The Check Am O campaign will let everyone know that TB testing and treatment are free and that they should tell anyone with a cough to Check Am O! Make you dey sure!” – Dr Adebola Lawanson, former National Coordinator NTBLCP.” The Acting USAID Mission Director, Katie Donohoe, added: “This campaign being launched today has the potential to be a gamechanger for the TB epidemic in Nigeria. With the support of the government, civil society, private sector and donor partners, this campaign can be catalytic in shifting health-seeking behaviors and generating unprecedented demand for and use of TB diagnostic services.”
