Four members of a family have died in a Tuesday-night blaze in Bida council area of Niger State. The fire, reportedly caused by an electric spark, burnt down a building on Monday night. Two wives of the deceased owner of the building, Alhaji Ahmadu Kabaraini, and his two grandchildren died in the inferno. A neighbour said the fire had burnt a large part of the house before anyone noticed, adding that the burglar-proof windows made it difficult to rescue those trapped in the house. Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, urged the family to see the incident as one beyond human redemption.
