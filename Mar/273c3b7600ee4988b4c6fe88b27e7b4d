Tata International Nigeria is offering a five-year warranty on its medium, heavy and extra-heavy commercial vehicles. This first-of-its-kind Pan Africa offer applies to the full range of Tata trucks, buses, as well as Daewoo trucks in all 12 markets in which Tata operates in Africa. Chief Executive Officer, Tata International Africa, Len Brand, said the five-year warranty offer reinforces the company’s commitment to enhancing the customer ownership experience. “We are extremely pleased to offer five years of assurance on our range of commercial vehicles while reiterating our commitment to the quality of our products. “Given Africa’s harsh and various terrains, this warranty goes a long way towards Tata International Africa’s pursuant of offering enhanced lifecycle benefits to its customers,” Len said. The offer applies to all Tata and Daewoo commercial vehicles registered on or after January 1, 2021, and are supported across Tata International Africa’s extensive dealership and service network including over 450 touchpoint outlets and service facilities across the continent. As an added advantage, the company said any customer wishing to sell the vehicle will enjoy a higher value and the warranty is transferable to the next owner.
