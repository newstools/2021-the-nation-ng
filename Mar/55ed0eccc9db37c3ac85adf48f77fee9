Recent drop in new cases of covid-19 in the country cannot be interpreted to mean a reduction in infection rate, a report by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has shown. Also, the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on covid-19 has again warned Nigerians against celebrating too early and interpreting the recent drop in new confirmed cases to mean a reduction in disease transmission. According to the data of NCDC covid-19 situation report , which was made available to The Nation, in the last 11 days, the epidemiological response by states with regards to testing of samples has been abysmal. Between February 22nd to March 4th, only 21,468 covid-19 tests were carried out across the 36 states of the country, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This came as the daily covid-19 report by the NCDC has been vacillating between 400 to 800 cases. This being a major divergent from the over 1,000 cases the country was recording, especially at the beginning of the second wave of the pandemic. Also, Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire, during one of the briefing of the PTF on covid-19 two weeks ago, urged Nigerians not to relax or let down their guards, but should continue to observe and adhere to the non-pharmaceutical interventions of physical distancing, regular handwashing, use of hand sanitisers, observance of respiratory hygiene, avoiding crowded places and above all, wearing appropriate face masks that also cover noses. Furthermore, the NCDC data showed that since the beginning of this year, the range of total weekly covid-19 tests conducted across states were between 50,000 to 80,000 sample tests. More specifically, between December 27th to January 3rd, 40,749 tests were carried out, with 5,733 confirmed cases. From January 4th to 10th, 70,408 tests were done, with 9,940 confirmed cases. Also, between January 11th to 17th, 67,947 tests were done with 10,300 confirmed cases. Between January 18th to 24th, 83,653 tests were carried out with 11,179 confirmed cases. Between January 25th to 31st, 83,690 tests were done, with 9,676 confirmed cases. Furthermore, between February 1st to 7th, 49,050 tests were done, with 8,506 confirmed cases. From February 8th to 21st, 52,197 tests were done, with 6,606 confirmed cases. Between February 15th to 21st, 64,520 tests were done, with 5,720 confirmed cases. It is, however, disturbing that from February 22nd to March 4th, only 21,468 tests were conducted. At the time of writing this report, the total number of tests carried out as of February 21st stood at 1,522,540, and the figure as of March 4, stood at 1,544,008. Itâ€™s believe that community transmission of the virus is grossly under-reported, as seen in the lull in the testing drive of states. Also, it was gathered by The Nation that more people are not reporting to designated testing and treatment centres, even when they experience the major signs of the infection.
