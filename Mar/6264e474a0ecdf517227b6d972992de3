An Ikeja Special Offences Court on Wednesday expressed concern over the delay in the trial of a kidnap suspect, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike (a.k.a. Evans). This followed the absence of prosecution witnesses  in the two cases involving the alleged kidnap kingpin. In one of the cases, Onwuamadike’s is being tried alongside a dismissed soldier, Victor Aduba for kidnapping and unlawful possession of firearms. They are accused of kidnapping Sylvanus Ahamonu, holding him hostage for nine weeks and collecting   $420,000 ransom from his family. During resumed proceedings on Wednesday, the prosecutor Mrs. O.A Bajulaiye-Bishi informed the court presided over by Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo that the prosecution was unable to serve the summons issued the witness because of the ill health  of the lead prosecutor, Mr. Yusuf Sule. Onwuamadike’s counsel, Victor Okpara, confirmed  the development. In the second suit, Onwuamadike is facing trial alongside Joseph Emeka, Chiemeka Arinze and Udeme Upong  for  an  attempted kidnap of Chief Vincent Obianodo, chairman of  Young Shall Grow Motors. When the matter came up,  Mrs. Bajulaiye-Bishi, informed the court that the witness,  Insp. Idowu Haruna, Investigating Police Officer (IPO) who was due to continue his testimony in the trial-within-trial was unavailable.
