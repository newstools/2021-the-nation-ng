Four suspected kidnappers terrorizing Abraka and Umutu axis of Ethiope East and Ukwauni council areas of Delta state, respectively, have been arrested by the security operatives. The suspects identified as Lucky Eduvire, 31, Freedom Uguru 33, Enita Omogware 38 and Henry Blessing Ovie 25, were arrested on Saturday, after a combined team of the Police, Department of State Service (DSS) and local vigilante operatives stormed a government reserved land in Obiaruku, a boundary community to Abraka, host to the Delta State University (DELSU). A gun exchange reportedly ensued between the operatives and the suspects before four of them were captured. Three motorcycles were recovered in the raid, while a manhunt has been launched for other suspects who escaped with bullet wounds. A statement by the acting spokesperson of the Delta State Police Command, DSP Edafe Bright, said the raid followed a protest by farmers, comprising women, of Abraka and Umutu communities over herdsmen killings and destruction of their farm produce. The statement said the forest area which was combed is believed to be a hideout for “killer herders.”
