Robert Lewandowski moved joint-second on the all-time Bundesliga scoring list as Bayern Munich won 3-1 at Werder Bremen. He is now level with Klaus Fischer on the all-time Bundesliga top scorers list with 268 goals. Midfielder, Leon Goretzka, and German winger, Serge Gnabry put the Bundesliga champion in front as they extended their lead at the top of the table to 58 points. Lewandowski’s 268th goal in the competition means only Gerd Muller with 365, has scored more goals in Germany’s top flight. Niclas Fullkrug hit a late consolation for the hosts who remain 12th. Second-placed RB Leipzig could cut Bayern’s lead at the top of the table to two points if they win their game in hand against Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday. According to Bayern legend Lothar Matthaus recently, “He has a fantastic team around him. The team is the key to breaking a record like this from Gerd Müller. “So, this is my prognosis for 2021, Robert Lewandowski will break the record from Gerd Müller and score more than 40 goals in the Bundesliga.” Poland international Lewandowski, 32, is 97 goals off that landmark but has managed his 268 from 345 games at 103 minutes per goal.
