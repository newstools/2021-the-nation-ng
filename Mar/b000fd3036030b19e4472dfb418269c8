Anthony Joshua has revealed Tyson Fury’s retirement plan as the pair gear up for a massive undisputed clash for all the top division belts. Joshua has engaged in fighting talk and branded Fury a ‘warm-up act’ ahead of their potential heavyweight clash later this year. Fury wants a two-bout saga with Joshua before a trilogy battle with; not Deontay Wilder – but Derek Chisora. These startling claims come from Joshua as he dissected his latest victory with Savage Dan.  “He (Fury) can bring whatever he wants. It doesn’t matter to me,” Joshua told JD Sports. “The press conference antics, the fight antics, the hands behind the back, I love that stuff that’s all part of it you know that’s his job, but my job is to close the show. “He’s a warm-up act and there to do all that stuff. Ultimately, my job is to close the show. That’s all that matters. “For him, he said that after he fights me, then maybe a fight with Chisora (again), and he’s ready to go off into the sunset.
