It said the government had promised to off-set the debt worth of N13,570,175 being the value of products of one of its members, Siluch Oil & Gas Ltd supplied to it, issuing it a 14-working days notice to fulfil its own part of the agreement or face shutdown by marketers in the state. The ultimatum was contained in a two page pre-action notice to Governor Willie Obiano and signed by Mr Chinedu Anyaso and Mr Oliver Ekwueme, Chairman and Secretary respectively of IPMAN Enugu Depot Anyaso said copies had been submitted to Police, Director of State Services, NSCDC and other security agencies in the state, stressing that the notice took effect from March and would elapse on April 8. The letter read in part, “IPMAN frowned at the delay of the state government to pay one of its members, Siluch Oil and Gas, the sum of N13.5 million for Automotive Gas Oil he supplied to it through the Transport Company of Anambra since 2017. “We express our displeasure over the refusal to provide the necessary document for a parcel of land we allocated to them for Petroleum Tankers Park in the state as contained in the MoU they entered in August last year. “In the light of the aforementioned, we considered it pertinent to humbly draw your attention on the need to expedite action within the stipulated period for the interest of justice on our member mentioned above. “We have resolved to use our necessary measures that borders on withdrawal of our services to your state in order to sensitise your government to do the needful within the time.”
