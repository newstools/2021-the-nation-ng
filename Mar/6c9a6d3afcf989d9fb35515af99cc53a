The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has felicitated with the Governor of Enugu State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, on his 57th birthday. Gbajabiamila said Ugwuanyi, who was a member of the House of Representatives until 2015, has been a friend worthy of being celebrated. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, on Saturday the Speaker said despite Ugwuanyi’s membership of a different political party, the Enugu State governor plays politics without bitterness, which is a virtue of a good politician. “The Speaker recalled with nostalgia Ugwuanyi’s contributions to the development of the Legislature when he served as a member. He congratulated the Enugu State Governor for marking his 57th birthday in good health and wished him more years under God’s protection and guidance,” the statement read.
