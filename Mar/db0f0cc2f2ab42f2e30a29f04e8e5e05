Jonathan Joshua Unekuojo, aka Nathanjae, has taken the Nigerian music industry by surprise with a two-song EP, ‘Two’s Day.’ The EP, which was released in February 2021 has become a household name, is currently enjoying airplay on radio and TV stations across Nigeria. According to Nathanjae, a Computer Science/Electronics graduate of the Lead City University, ‘Two’s Day’ is synonymous with two songs in the album, which dwells on the relationship between man and woman, boys and girls. He said the songs preach good life and love as it relates to societal coexistence, urging them to embrace peace and love in their daily activities. In “Two’s Day,” produced by Fedo, Nathanjae shows his diversity by creating a unique sound with a fusion of Afrobeat, Hip Hop, Ethnic pop, Reggae. He revealed that ‘Two’s Day’ has a follow-up video for one of the singles in the EP, ‘Stew Gang’ (ft Eeskay), and many more activities planned to entertain his fans and critics. Hear him: “I started my music career in the church at Jubilee Bible Church, because I’ve been a church boy, and I performed on the stage for the first time when I was in SS3. It is a moment I cannot forget because the performance was electrifying as my audience were all over my yearning for more. Ever since it has been no looking back and everywhere has been cool. That is why in one of the songs ín the EP, I entitled it ‘Stew Gang, meaning everywhere is cool for jollification.” The 24-year-old singer hails from Kogi State and has several songs to his name. Nathanjae has performed on the same bill with several prominent artists including M.I. Abaga, Davido, Mayourkun, DJ Spinall, Dremo, Oxlade, and Zlatan.
