Gunmen have abducted two students and a teacher at the National Institute for Construction Technology, Uromi, Edo State. The three were taken away in a raid on Wednesday night. The abducted teacher was identified simply as Miss Uzo, of the Environmental Studies Department of the institution. It was learnt Thursday in Benin that the kidnappers invaded the institute amid gunshots. Parents and guardians stormed the institute yesterday to inquire after their children and wards. The students were writing their second semester examinations when the gunmen invaded the school. A former Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Friday Itulah called “on the police and other security agencies to beef up security in Esan land and other parts of Edo State.” Police spokesman Bello Kontongs confirmed the incident, saying that police were on the trail of the kidnappers.
