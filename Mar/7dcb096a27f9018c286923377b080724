Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has called on the government of Kaduna State to swing into action and do everything within its power to rescue the eight members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), kidnapped in Kaduna Friday evening. This was as the Senator who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly, Shehu Sani lamented that bandits have turned Kaduna State into a hub of kidnapping. It will be recalled that eight members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) were been kidnapped by bandits Friday evening while on transit along the Kachia -Kafanchan Road in the southern part of the state. The Senator in his reaction via his Twitter handles said, “The report of the Kidnapping of RCCG members along Kachia road in Kaduna is yet another tragedy. “Bandits have turned our state into their hub; before one kidnap is resolved, another one is unfolding. Humans have become prey. On entry you meet their snare, on exit you meet their ambush,” Senator Sani said. Meanwhile, the Kaduna State Chapter of the apex Christian body in the country, (CAN), said, “we are appealing government, we are appealing to security agencies to do everything within their power to rescue the victims.” The CAN Chairman, Rev. Joseph Hayab who made the appeal in an interview with The Nation however said the Church is praying for quick release of the kidnapped persons.
