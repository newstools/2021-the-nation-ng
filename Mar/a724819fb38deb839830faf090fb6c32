The Presidency on Saturday dispelled fears that President Muhammadu Buhari might have suffered a side effect from the jab of COVID-19 vaccine he received earlier in the day. A statement issued by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said President Buhari had not experienced any discomfort as a result of the jab as was being rumoured in some quarters. The statement said the President had been going about his normal business since he took the vaccine. It, however, assured that there would be no need for any cover-up if there was any development, hoping that the fact the President had not reacted negatively would assure citizens of the country that the vaccine is safe and dissolve the fears breeding hesitancy. Shehu said: â€œIn response to press enquiries, I like to assure all citizens and to dispel fears and misconceptions about the safety of the vaccine administered on President Muhammadu Buhari and the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, earlier this morning.
