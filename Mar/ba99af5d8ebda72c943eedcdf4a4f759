Real Madrid have been informed that Erling Haaland wants to play for them, say reports in Spain, with the Norwegian striker eager to become the club’s ‘main man’ next season. The 20-year-old striker, who is currently valued at €110 million, has attracted the interest of top European clubs in recent months, although his hefty price tag will mean only a select few will be able to attain his services. In fact, Haaland’s agent Mino Raiola has recent claimed that only ten clubs will be able to afford the generational talent as a €100 million release clause comes into effect in 2022. Despite the price tag, however, Haaland and his bright future will certainly bring suitors and somebody who look more and more likely to make a move for the talented forward are Real Madrid.
