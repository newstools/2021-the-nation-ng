Singer and celebrity disc jockey DJ Cuppy has been accepted into Oxford University, London for a master’s degree programme. In an Instagram post on Friday, the 28-year-old shared a video call she had with her parents breaking the news to them. The singer told them she was going to Oxford for her master’s and has been assigned to the Lady Margaret Hall. She also told her mum Nana Otedola she was hoping her father would pay the tuition but her billionaire father Femi Otedola jokingly replied that he had paid her school fees well enough and he was sure she could handle this one. “HUGE NEWS and I had to tell my parents first! I’ve been accepted into OXFORD UNIVERSITY for a Masters!!! This degree is dedicated to @Nana_Otedola & @FemiOtedola #CuppyOnAMission,” she wrote. Cuppy attended Grange School, Ikeja. She then relocated to London for her GCSEs and A-Levels. She graduated from King’s College, London in July 2014 with a degree in business and economics. She also earned a master’s degree in music business from New York University in 2015. Cuppy started her music career in 2014, first as a DJ and then as a singer.
