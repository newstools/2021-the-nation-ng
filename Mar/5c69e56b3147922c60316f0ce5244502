Israel Adesanya’s coach, Eugene Bareman, has refused to make any excuses for the 31-year-old after his bid to become a two-weight champion was brought to an abrupt end at UFC 259. Having stepped up to light-heavyweight, Adesanya suffered the first defeat of his professional career on Saturday night when he lost to Jan Blachowicz in Las Vegas. Bareman said  Adesanya is ‘humble’ about the defeat and insists the changes in preparation due to travel and COVID-19 safety protocol were not to blame for his loss. Bareman also downplayed the weight difference between Adesanya and Blachowicz and claims the two will face each other again. Speaking about Adesanya’s defeat, Bareman told Submission Radio: “No excuses. “I think the training camp went well, and the lead-up to the fight in fight week was brilliant. “Nah, I don’t. There are no excuses here. This is the thing, man, when you lose, it doesn’t happen in this sport nowadays, but sometimes you just lose and you just have to take it. “And we are as a team internalising it, and we’re being humble about it and taking it like a loss, like you should do. “It doesn’t happen enough in this sport. People kind of refuse to accept a loss, but we’re accepting it we’re looking to take what we can out of it.”
