A firm, Pine Empress Limited, has launched ‘The Visionary Employee Program’, a bespoke training solution for employees, carefully curated with consideration for the unique needs of career professionals, government parastatals, MSMEs and SMEs, customer service executives and multinational organizations. Speaking at the launch of programme in Lagos, CEO of Pine Empress Ltd, Adesewa Greg-Ighodaro, said the initiative is a signature framework for employers willing to invest in their workforce and employees who are ready to take personal responsibility for their growth and development of the organisation “As the world is advancing, employees who are the human capital of any business must also upskill for them to remain relevant and efficient at work or else, they will become redundant,” she said. According to her: “The visionary employee takes the bull by the horn and invests resources into becoming the employee every employer wants on their team. “The era of employers neglecting to train their employees efficiently has fizzled out. The employer who wants to launch big ideas and grow the vision of the business exponentially must invest in ensuring their employees are coached to become exemplar, forward-thinking visionaries that can run with their vision and produce sterling results. “An untrained and uncoached employee is a disaster waiting to happen for the employee personally, and the employer by extension. This is our big why for launching this Program.”
