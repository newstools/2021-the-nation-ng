Two brothers, Isaac Sunday and Isaac Lucky, as well as their accomplice, Ovie Nana Friday, have been sentenced to death by hanging for stealing. They were said to have committed the offence in December 2013 by robbing many residents of Bolorunduro in Ondo state. The convicts were said to have used dangerous weapons to steal mobile phones, motorcycle, cash and other valuables. They were first arraigned on a five-count charge to include conspiracy and armed robberies. The charges were later amended to six. The Prosecution led by Chief Legal Officer in the Ondo state Ministry of Justice, Olusegun Akeredolu, called four witnesses and tendered confessional statements of the accused which were admitted after trial within trial. The defendants represented by Mr Samson Iluyemi testified for themselves but tendered no exhibit. Trial Judge, Justice Yemi Fasanmi, said the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubts. He sentenced the two brothers and their accomplice to death by hanging.
