Former presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has condemned the attack on Benue Governor Samuel Ortom, saying it was a ploy to cause mayhem and confusion in the state. Olawepo-Hashim said in a statement in Abuja the attack was an indication that criminal elements have infiltrated the region, posing a threat to law-abiding citizens no matter their status in life. While appealing to Nigerians to tone down their rhetoric and be advocates of peace and harmony, the businessman said such an attack on Nigerians was unacceptable. He urged the government to institute a full-scale investigation with a view to bringing the culprits to book. According to him: “Just recently, elder brother to Senator Gabriel Suswan,a former governor of the state was killed. ‘’Such high profile killing and the recent attempt on the life Governor Ortom was an indication that some people are not happy with the peaceful order in the state. “The police must spare no resources to apprehend and bring to justice those who masterminded, planned and executed this assassination attempt.” He added: “This assassination attempt further brings to mind the urgency for our call for states police. “No Chief executive or citizens of any state in our Republic should ever again be left to the mercy of callous increasingly audacious non-state actors.” He noted that an attack on Ortom, who holds the symbol of authority of the state, could be likened to a declaration of war on Nigeria and must not be handled with kids’ glove.
