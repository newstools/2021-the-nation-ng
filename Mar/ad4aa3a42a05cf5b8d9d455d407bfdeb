Oba of Lagos Rilwan Akiolu on Wednesday said that those who invaded his palace last October during the #EndSARS protest stole $2 million and N17 million. Youths vandalised the monarch’s Iga Idungaran, Lagos Island palace, and went away with some properties including the Staff of Office. Akiolu at the commissioning of the Glover Hall Memorial in Lagos said those who attacked his palace were ignorant of the implication of their action. He called on the Federal Government to assist Lagos to recover from the destruction it suffered during the crisis. “I will support anything that will move Lagos forward. I have appealed to the Federal Government to assist Lagos with what we have suffered. The incident that happened here from October 20th to 23rd is so saddening. The destruction we suffered in Lagos is enormous. “Many buildings were burnt, including vehicles used to generate income. I can now say publicly that they stole from my palace $2 million and N17 million,” he said.
