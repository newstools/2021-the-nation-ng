Nigeria-born New Zealand Ultimate Fighting Club (UFC) champion, Israel Adesanya, has apologised to his fans after recording his first defeat as an Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter. Despite a valiant effort over five rounds, Adesanya’s attempt to become a two-division champion was thwarted by light heavyweight champion Jan Blachowicz in the main event at UFC 259 on Saturday night He offered no excuses and noted that although he entered the bout 20-0 as an MMA fighter, he has experienced defeat before. “I have lost before,” Adesanya said after the fight. “I have lost in kickboxing. I have lost in boxing. I lost in life and I have lost in love. You don’t win all the time. I am still here. My team is still here. They still love me. My family loves me.” “Losses are part of life … this is the dip in my story. This is the failure if you will. Then I will rise up again like the phoenix that I am.” “Everyone who supports me, all my people, I appreciate you. I am sorry,” he said to close out the press conference. “I like to make my fans be proud when they say what I am going to do, what I have already said being champ-champ or double champ, whatever. I am sorry I let you down.”
