 Director-General of the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), Prof. Abubakar Sulaiman, has called on Nigerians to imbibe the culture of civility and debate as a panacea to violent tendencies. Professor Sulaiman gave the advice during a chat with reporters at the semi-finals of the 6th edition of the legislative quiz competition for secondary schools in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.

He said the annual legislative quiz competition organised by the Institute is geared towards instilling the culture of debate in the younger generation. Sulaiman said: “Our prospect is that democracy has come to stay because considering the responses of the students to most of the questions being asked; I feel much fulfilled. “The expectation is to get younger democrats that will imbibe the culture of civility, dialogue, debate and discourse rather than the culture of violence.  “We resort to anarchy and violence by failing to imbibe the culture of debate, dialogue and discourse. “So, when you have that culture of give-and-take, you will have less friction, anarchy and violence in the society.” The Principal, Model Secondary School, Maitama Abuja, one of the venues for the zonal quiz competition, Mrs Elizabeth Emagun, said the students, through the quiz competition which is centred on the legislative arm of government will know how to live at peace with other members of society. Master Fortune Onyekachi from Government Secondary School, Tundun-Wada and Janet Bwayifa from Government Secondary School, Pyakasa,  said the competition has deepened their knowledge about the legislature and their rights and responsibilities in society. respectively.   “We now know what Senators and members of House of Representatives do in the National Assembly,” Onyekachi told reporters.
