Nigeria have qualified for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) scheduled for Cameroon ahead of their Match Day 5 fixture. This happened after Sierra Leone played a goalless draw with Lesotho on Saturday. Lesotho hosted Sierra Leone in the earlier fixture at the Setsoto Stadium in Maseru, drawing 0-0. This meant table-toppers Nigeria with eight points have secured their 2021 AFCON ticket, while the Benin Republic with seven points can also ensure qualification. But this will be if they get a draw against visiting Nigeria. Sierra Leone with four points occupied the third spot on the log. They will be counting on the Super Eagles to do them the favour of beating the Squirrels in Port Novo. Nigeriaâ€™s victory over the Benin Republic will give the Leone Stars a slim hope of qualification heading into their penultimate round fixture. Bottom-placed Lesotho with three points are out of the race and will be playing for pride against the Super Eagles at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos on Tuesday. GROUP L MP W D L Pts 1.
