Lewd singer and rapper, Naira Marley has reaffirmed his decision to release a new album in 2021. In December 2020, Naira Marley announced that he will be releasing his album between March and April 2021. In confirmation of his commitment towards releasing the body of work, Naira Marley gave a proposed name for the album as well as a hint on the exact time of release. “I am definitely (releasing an album). It’s called GTTB (God timings the best) and would be dropping after Ramadan,” the singer cum rapper said. The reaffirmation came days after Naira Marley released a fresh single ahead of the highly anticipated album. The current single, ‘Coming,’ has been making waves as well as igniting another round of controversy around the singer and his way of life. In a series of controversial tweets, Naira Marley wrote, “Just because I dropped ‘coming’ y’all think I’m a pornstar.” He went further to implore his fans not to censor his new single despite the explicit and lewd contents. “If u sensor my new song, u will just be listening to only instrumental. I don’t even know how I feel right now, they’re using my new song #Coming to sell sex toys.” The 29-year-old father is born Azeez Fashola and has been in the news for various reasons ranging from the explicit contents in his songs, his cult-like followership, his brush with the law over alleged fraud activities, and fracas with some of his colleagues. However, the singer and rapper are known to have always desisted from his lewd contents during the month of Ramadan.
