Martin Odegaard set Arsenal on their way to a commanding first-leg victory over Olympiakos in their Europa League last-16 tie. The Norwegian opened the scoring with a powerful 20-yard drive, with Gabriel restoring their lead after a defensive error allowed Youssef El Arabi to equalise for the hosts. An otherwise excellent evening for the Gunners was rounded off by Mohamed Elneny’s superb long-range strike late on. With three valuable away goals, Mikel Arteta’s side are well placed to avoid a repeat of their dramatic exit to the Greek champions last term.However, the Spaniard will not be happy with a number of defensive lapses. Lax play from both David Luiz and Odegaard went without punishment but they were not as fortunate when goalkeeper Bernd Leno played substitute Dani Ceballos into trouble, and their tormentor from last term El Arabi stroked in the equaliser. Until then they more then merited their lead with Odegaard atoning for an early miss with a strike that bamboozled home goalkeeper Jose Sa. And in a dominant early display Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was also denied a goal with Sa brilliantly diverting his header on to the crossbar.
