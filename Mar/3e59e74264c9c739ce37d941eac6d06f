Yobe Governor Mai Mala Buni on Thursday performed the commissioning ceremony of the newly completed 13 floor Twin Tower Ultra modern headquarters building of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in Port Harcourt. Buni, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari, commissioned the project in company of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Godswill Akpabio and Imo Governor Hope Uzodinma. The NDDC headquarters has been operating from a rented building since the commission started operating. The building, which started in 1996 witnessed slow pace of work until 2019 when President Muhammadu Buhari committed to its completion. In line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s commitment to prudent management of resources, the completion of the office building, Godswill Akpabio said, will create an efficiency of N300 million paid yearly as rent for NNDC’s old office. The new NDDC office is equipped with facilities including hospital, banking hall, conference hall and restaurant.
