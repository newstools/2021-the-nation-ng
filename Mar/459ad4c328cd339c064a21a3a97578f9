A Federal High Court in Lagos has dismissed the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP)’s suit seeking to disqualify Senator Adetokunbo Abiru of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from continuing to represent Lagos East Senatorial District. Justice Chuka Obiozor, in a five-hour judgment, upheld the argument canvassed by Abiru’s lawyer, Mr Kemi Pinheiro, SAN, that the PDP’s case was statute barred.
