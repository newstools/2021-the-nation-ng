Posters and billboards announcing the presidential ambition of Kogi Governor Yahaya Bello have flooded Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa states. The posters and billboards in Yenagoa, capital of Bayelsa State, are sponsored by the Niger Delta GYB Support Group. They adorn major roads in the three states. An activist, Comrade Temple Seriake, said it is high time the youths took over the affairs of the nation. Urging Bello to run for President, he said: “As youth, we have to take our destinies in our own hands. We cannot keep quiet and expect this nation to serve our needs. We have to make this nation work for us. “I used to be in the PDP. But, we have seen that the party that can give us a youthful President is the All Progressives Congress (APC). At a meeting in Port Harcourt, we all agreed to register with APC and make our voices loud for our fathers to supervise us while we lead this country into greatness. “Governor Yahaya Bello understands our language and we understand his. We are of the same generation. He understands the dynamics of modern global leadership and the need to reposition Nigeria. “2023 will be the year of the youth and it is our hope to have GYB in the Villa and youth in the National Assembly and Houses of State Assembly. We will not fail Nigeria”. Comrade Seriake urged the youths to register and dominate the APC in order to have a “loud voice” within the party. He added: “To achieve our goal, we call on all the youth to come out massively and register IN APC. Politically, we can’t wrestle power by standing on a weak platform. Let us take over the APC. “When we told Yahaya Bello to come and be President, he told us to go and populate the APC. He is a passionate APC leader. He is the man to lead Nigeria forward.” Groups loyal to other potential aspirants are also meeting to assess the threat posed by Bello.
