A former Clan Chairman of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Prince Odum has berated the Leader of Kengema Unity Forum, Sobomabo Jackrich (a.k.a Egberipapa) for allegedly making an uncomplimentary remarks against Governor Nyesom Wike. Jackrich had while declaring his intention to run for the 2023 Governorship election in the state, criticised  Wike’s government and his developmental projects , demanding transparency in the building of Trans-Kalabari road. Odum said Jackrich lacks moral justification to demand transparency or accountability from the state  government or on  any of the developmental projects, describing that as height of hypocrisy, and urged the ex-militant leader to stop the deception. Odum said: “It is the height of hypocrisy and deception for  Jackrich to make such  demand or even criticise Governor Wike on  governance. Odum advised Jackrich  to stop discrediting the good works of Governor  Wike, who he said had  performed creditably beyond the expectations of many especially his critics and naysayers”. Odum called on  Wike to remain focused in his efforts at transforming the landscape of the state, and not allow distraction.
