Three young men were reportedly killed by suspected cultists on Tuesday morning in Owhase and Ovwian communities, Udu council area of Delta state. Residents reportedly woke up to see the lifeless body of one of the deceased simply identified as Otobo close to New York Junction, along Udu Road. A photo of late Otobo obtained by THE NATION showed he was stabbed multiple times on the face, one of his arms and belly. A tricycle operator, who spoke in confidence, said: “I saw him lying dead this morning along the road. He looked fresh. It is really sad how his life was wasted because of cultism”. While details on the two others killed in Ovwian community are sketchy, unconfirmed reports say the three killings may be connected. As at the time of filing this report, the deceased Otobo had been evacuated from the scene.
