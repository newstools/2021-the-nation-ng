Days after her daughter, Gumsu Abacha, got quietly married to the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, former First Lady, Maryam Abacha, had another reason to celebrate and thank God earlier in the week. Despite losing her husband, former military Head of State, General Sani Abacha, many years ago, she has remained strong for her children. It is, however, a season of celebration for the household. Last weekend, she gave her daughter’s hand in marriage in a ceremony held at Mohammed Abacha’s residence in Abuja. On Thursday too, she celebrated her new age – 73 years. Although Gumsu was previously married to Cameroonian billionaire, Bayero Fadil Mohamadou, they have since separated. She is now the fourth wife of Governor Buni, who is also married to his predecessor’s daughter, Ummi Adama Gaidam. Blessed with ten children – three daughters and seven sons – Maryam Abacha was the First Lady of Nigeria between 1993 and 1998 when her beloved husband died.
