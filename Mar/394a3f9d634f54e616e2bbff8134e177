Four students of Idito Secondary School in Lagelu Local Government Area of Oyo state were reportedly killed on Monday in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital. The Nation learnt that the students were going to school on a motorcycle when the truck crushed them along Iwo-road, Ibadan expressway. The state police public relations officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, who confirmed the incident to The Nation in Ibadan on Monday, said the Divisional Police Officer in the area had sent the signal to the state command headquarters, Eleyele, Ibadan. Fadeyi said, “It is true. The DPO told me that the incident happened when the driver of the truck was trying to avoid killing some sheep and rammed into the students on the Okada. Police have moved to the area to ensure life and prosperity were not vandalised by the angry students.”  Our Correspondent reports that the students of the school moved to the nearby park and vandalised vehicles in the area. Eyewitness told The Nation that parents of the students have stormed the schools to pick their children, but it is unclear whether the four children belong to same parents.
