Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Friday for the first time disclosed that he once tested positive for the dreaded Coronavirus but was relieved 72 hours later when subsequent tests came out negative. Obasanjo who turned 84 today (March 5), said he was a bit concerned such that he had to call his daughter, Dr. Iyabo Obasanjo – Bello, that he was not having any symptom but COVID – 19 test from sample extracted from him reads positive. The elder statesman who disclosed this in Abeokuta while making his remarks at a colloquium put in place to celebrate his 84th birthday within Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, said Iyabo’s verdict was that the result might be faulty and required further tests. According to him, subsequent tests 72 hours later, all certified him negative to the coronavirus. Obasanjo therefore, advised people not to be afraid to come close to felicitate with him on his birthday because of the dread of COVID – 19 infection, saying he has tested negative three times.
