Manchester United in the ongoing Women’s Super League have walloped West Ham with two goals. The Man Utd club side which has never played at the men’s team’s home since their reformation in 2018 are playing at Old Trafford for the very first time. West Ham are first to the corner but Man Utd won their first-ever goal at Old Trafford at the 49th minute after the ball loops up and forward Lauren James nods it in at the back post. Christen Press delivered the second goal at the 54th minute following fantastic assistance from Jackie Groenen who plays a beautiful blind leading to the take-out of two West Ham defenders. The Man Utd forward did not waste the assist as he hammered the ball beyond West Ham keeper Courtney Brosnan.
