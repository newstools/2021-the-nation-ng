The leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) will on Wednesday receive the report of an investigation into the circumstances that led to the party’s loss of the 2019 presidential election to the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari. Stakeholders have attributed the inability of the PDP to define its plan of action for the 2023 election to the delay in the submission of the said report assigned to a committee. The delay in the submission of the report is also said to be delaying the party’s decision on the zoning of its 2023 presidential ticket. The committee, chaired by the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, was saddled with the responsibility of identifying factors that led to the party’s loss of the presidential election, against expectations of party leaders and members. The outcome of the 2019 presidential election had thrown the PDP leadership off balance as various independent opinion polls conducted before the poll had tipped the PDP and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar as the likely winner. The presentation ceremony, which is billed to hold at 12 noon at the PDP national secretariat, is expected to be attended by members of the National Working Committee (NWC), the Board of Trustees (BoT), PDP Governors, the National Assembly caucus and other stakeholders.
