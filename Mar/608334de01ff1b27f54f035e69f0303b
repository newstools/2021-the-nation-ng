A Professor of Mathematics at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-ife, Samuel Segun Okoya says mathematics could be used to end farmers-herdsmen crisis plaguing Nigeria. Okoya said this while delivering a lead paper entitled: ‘Helping students understand mathematics for a better world’ at the International Day of Mathematics celebration organised by the Department of Physical Sciences, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. He explained how accurate data and statistics from indigenous activities could be used to track meat consumption, cattle rearing traffic identification and migration. He said doing so would minimise security challenges in the ECOWAS region. On open grazing and farmers-herders crises, the don said the scenario could be modelled mathematically to put an end to the lingering crises. Okoya said Nigeria must demonstrate commitment to take records of influx of herdsmen to specific states by registering each livestock and assigning them with a programmed wrist band/Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) record navigation while using Geographic Information System (GIS).  “This will help to locate all cattles and their breeders anytime. Weather forecasts will enhance the grazing planning and prevent events of tragic flooding.” He also canvassed registration of farmers with their landmass in specific states. “This will open a lot of job opportunities in modeling and computations. It will monitor physical movement of herdsmen by appropriate authorities and minimise frictions. This can be done using the branch of mathematics called Cybernetics” Okoya explained how mathematical tools can be used to forecast events that will happen in the future. “How Technology can aid to collect, store and analyse data on Mathematics and Scientific prediction of everyday events such as accurate weather forecasts.”
