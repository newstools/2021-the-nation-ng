Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has claimed the septuagenarian arrested by operatives of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) last Sunday is not the “wanted Wakili”. In a series of tweets, Fani-Kayode said the arrested old man is not the prime suspect. According to him: “One Isikilu Wakili, a foreign terrorist who operates in the Ibarapa area, is the most notorious, dangerous and bloodthirsty terrorist in the South-West today. “He killed even more people yesterday. He is even worse than Abu and the old man that is in police custody in Ibadan. “The Isikilu Wakili that is still at large is the leading mafia don and he is a brutal and cold-blooded rapist and killer. He has brought torment and carnage to the people of the South-West.” He said only the collaboration of security forces with local vigilante, especially popular Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho will lead arrest of the wanted Wakili. “I call on my friend and brother, Sunday Igboho to support & and assist the Nigeria Police Force and intelligence agencies to find him, fish him out and bring him to justice. “This must be done within the law and it must be done with power and precision. Now is the time to free the people of Ibarapa and the SW of his wickedness and barbarity. “Now is the time to do what ought to have been done long ago. I trust our security forces to do the right thing. “The old man that they have in custody is not the real Mcoy. Isikilu is the real Mcoy and he is still out there killing our people. “Only our security forces with the total support and commitment of Sunday Igboho, the local community and the gallant and fearless sons and daughters of Oduduwa can save the day. And save the day they must,” he said.
