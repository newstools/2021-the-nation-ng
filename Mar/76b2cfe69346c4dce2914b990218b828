Africa’s leading telecoms group, Liquid Telecom and Eutelsat Communication have partnered to deepen broadband internet provision in the country via satellite. To achieve this, Liquid Telecom has renewed and expanded its Ku band capacity agreements on Eutelsat Communications’ (Euronext Paris: ETL) Eutelsat 7B satellite. Under this multi-year, multi transponder agreement, Liquid Telecom will further leverage the coverage of sub-Saharan Africa of the 7° East orbital position to extend its VSAT services. This will provide customers with fast and reliable internet access, even in the most remote corners of the region. Commenting on the agreement, Chief Commercial Officer of Eutelsat, Philippe Oliva,  said: “We are delighted to have the opportunity to take the partnership between Liquid Telecom and Eutelsat to the next level. By working together to further strengthen our ties, we can ensure that the combination of Eutelsat’s satellite coverages of sub-Saharan Africa and Liquid Telecom’s unrivaled expertise in the VSAT market can deliver the highest possible service levels to Liquid’s customers throughout the continent”. Also speaking, the CEO of Liquid Telecom Satellite Services, Scott Mumford,  said: “We are delighted to renew and expand our agreements with Eutelsat, ensuring we can continue to rely on its support and coverage to deliver high-speed, reliable connectivity to existing and future customers, no matter where they are located.”
