 A bandit said to have over 100 fighters under him has been killed in Kaduna, the state government said yesterday, adding that members of gang were also gunned down. The bandits’ commander Rufai Maikaji and his men were neutralised by bombers, Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said yesterday. Aruwan said the hoodlums  were killed on the fringes of Malul Forest in Igabi council area of the state. “The prompt response by the air platforms ended the reign of terror maintained by Rufai Maikaji and his bloodsucking accomplices. From further checks, Rufai Maikaji and his group were confirmed to be responsible for the killing, kidnapping and cattle rustling in many communities in Giwa, Igabi and Chikun LGAs,” Aruwan said.
