Global Spectrum Energy Services (GSES) Plc has been awarded a ‘Bbb‘ rating by Agusto & Co, a leading rating agency in the country. GSES is one of the leading indigenous offshore support vessel companies operating in the marine security and logistics subsector of the oil and gas servicing industry in Nigeria. According to Agusto, the rating assigned to GSES was upheld by the company’s low leverage or zero debt exposure as the business is largely funded with equity, adequate working capital, and experienced and stable management team as well as growing client portfolio of international oil companies. “Agusto & Co expects the overall financial condition of GSES to remain stable in the medium to long term due to the additional contract signed subsequent to year end. Based on the aforementioned, Agusto & Co hereby attaches a stable outlook to the rating of Global Spectrum Energy Services Plc,” the rating report stated. The rating agency noted that assigning a stable status to the company further pinned the favourable prospects for the company’s growth and profitability to factors that include the expected rebound in the consumption of crude oil as the global economy recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, favourable local content policy, and its entry into the merchant shipping security escort services. The report noted that the merchant shipping escort service is a growing line of business that the company is currently giving new focus as it expands and diversifies its operations.
