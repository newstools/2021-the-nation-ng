  Victor  Osimhen’s agent Roberto Calenda is confident the Nigeria international  would repay the faith  on him by Napoli’s coach Gennaro Gattuso. “I’ve heard a lot of things lately, the guy (Osimhen) has been out for a long time. Everything and more happened to him but he never left, he was always present in Naples and tried to do the best for Napoli. Now we hope that he will have a better fate and that he can continue to train and play continuously,” Calenda said. He added: “He (Osimhen) wants to help Napoli and is his main goal. He has in the ropes the fact of aiming high, playing the Champions League and being the protagonist I think is the ambition of every player and he has many. He is a generous guy and has the opportunity to show off. Let’s hope everything goes well.”  Ahead of this weekend’s Serie A tie against Milan, he said: “He (osimhen) has been out for a long time and the team hasn’t been training together in a very long time. It takes time to group and connect. The work has to be done together. Victor was out 94 days in a row and then returned to Bergamo. I am the first to wish that he can do well but we always give time to time, these are important things.” Meanwhile former Napoli star Francesco Colonnese believes Osimhen has added depth to Napoli’s attack. “With Osimhen in the field, Napoli finally attacked the depth as they had done in the past and had shown at the beginning and when he does so he is a devastating player. Gattuso’s Napoli played well, scored many goals and conceded no goals. There are times when you can be aesthetically beautiful but at the same time you cannot expose yourself to enormous risks. With yesterday’s victory, Inter put a sort of stamp, they booked the Scudetto. It is the strongest team this year because when you win with Juve, with Milan, with Atalanta and the direct clashes it means that you are the strongest,” Colonnese said.
