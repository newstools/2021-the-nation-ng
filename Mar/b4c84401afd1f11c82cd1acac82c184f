Nigerian female fashion entrepreneurs now have an opportunity to enhance their skills, improve their competitiveness and earn more through the skill-up programme in garment production. The skill improvement programme is being offered by the African Fashion Development and Empowerment Centre (AFDEC), a not-for-profit organization supported by the European Union and German Development Cooperation (GIZ) through the Nigerian Competitiveness Project. The training programme which kicked off in Lagos on Monday in commemoration of International Women Day will last for a period for two months. According to the organisers, the training is free for eligible women-owned enterprises who have been involved in fashion and garment production for a minimum of two years period and have a registered business incorporation status with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC).
