Nigerian Music Stars Wizkid and Burna Boy emerged winners at the 2021 Grammy Awards. While Burna Boy’s ‘Twice As Tall’, his last year’s project, fetched him the ‘Best Global Music Album’ Category, Wizkid won his first-ever Grammy award for his role in ‘Brown Skin Girl’, a 2019 song by Beyonce. ‘Brown Skin Girl’ was nominated for the category alongside ‘Life Is Good’, a song by Future featuring Drake, ‘Lockdown’ by Anderson Park, ‘Adore You’ by Harry Styles and ‘Goliath’ by Woodkid.
