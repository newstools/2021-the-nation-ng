The Federal Government has asked Organised Labour not to embark on strike because of the minimum wage bill in the National Assembly. The Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige made this appeal Tuesday at the meeting of the National Labour Advisory Council (NLAC) in Owerri, Imo State. The event was virtually declared open by the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo on behalf of President Muhammdu Buhari. Ngige said much as he supports Organised Labour 100 percent on the bill, they should not embark on strike because of it. The billion, which has passed second reading in the House of Representatives, was sponsored by Garba Datti Muhammad representing Sabon Gari federal constituency in Kaduna State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress(APC). The Minister said Labour needed not to thank him for his position on the bill, as he was re-echoing what the Federal Government stood for by adopting conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on the minimum wage. Ngige also assured of the governmentâ€™s commitment to stemming the current negative effects of the global financial and economic crisis on employment by strengthening the machinery of tripartism and social dialogue.
