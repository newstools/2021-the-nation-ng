 The National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) has engaged Akewa Colmar Terminal Limited (ACTL) to move containers from Lagos Ports to Onitsha River Port via Burutu Port in Delta State. The deal is aimed at not only decongesting the Lagos Ports, but also to ensure that the Onitsha River Port becomes functional. In a statement, the General Manager, Corporate Affairs,  NIWA, Jibril Darda’u, explained that the idea of hauling containers via Burutu Ports to Onitsha River port is to  avoid the two bridges between Gbarekolo and Bumandi. This is because they are too tiny and shallow for sea-moving badges and vessels to ply; hence the consideration of ACTL to activate the route from Lagos Ports to Burutu Port, then to Onitsha River Port as final destination. The Managing Director of NIWA, Dr. George Moghalu, said NIWA is targeting about 1,000 containers to be hauled per trip from Lagos Ports to Onitsha River Port within four days. He added that NIWA is engaging Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) and other stakeholders to facilitate the commencement of the cargo haulage. The Chairman, ACTL, Chief Kenneth Donye, expressed the readiness of his company to partner  NIWA in carrying out this noble and historic transshipment from Lagos Ports via Burutu Port to Onitsha River Port as final destination.
