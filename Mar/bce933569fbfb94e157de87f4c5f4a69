It said this was the outcome of its preliminary investigation. The Nation had reported unspecified travellers were abducted on Osogbo/Ibokun road near Ajebandele village in Obokun Council Area. Osun Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode, stated this while featuring on a radio programme monitored by The Nation in Osogbo capital of Osun. He assured his men were still combing the forest as three to four travellers are still missing after the attack in the area. According to him: “With the information with us now between three to four victims are still with the abductors. “I was personally there but I am impressed with the way the members of the community came out to support us, we have so many police officers in the bush, we have vigilantes, hunters and Amotekun and were all there in the bus not minding the long distance in the bush, the rough and many turnings I am impressed. “We interviewed people around the scene of crime, they said those criminals speak languages that could not be traceable to neither Hausa, Igbo or Yoruba but unknown language and we are suspecting Fulfulde language but we don’t know until they are arrested. We are resolute that they will be arrested.” He added from investigation at the scene of the crime, the dead victim sustained injury from AK-47 rifle bullet.
