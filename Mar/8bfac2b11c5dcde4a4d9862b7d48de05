 Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule has explained that the security agencies deployed to the state by President Muhammadu Buhari have chased leaders of Boko Haram out of Nasarawa State. He advised the people not to panic that Boko Haram has moved from Borno State to Nasarawa State. Governor Sule stated this during an interactive session with reporters at the Government House, Lafia. According to him, what happened was that, around 2016, a group of Darusalam that was sent out of Niger State didn’t find any other place to settle down than to settle in Nasarawa State.  “They came to Hutu in Toto Local Government Area, in a village where Bassa used to be, since Bassa is no longer there. “They settled there and began sympathising with Boko Haram and they entered some kind of agreement and started paying allegiance to Boko Haram. “Mr President came in strongly and supported the state and we had a joint operation of the Police, the Military, the Airforce, and the Navy that were able to dislodge them. “Majority of their leaders have left Nasarawa State completely and returned to other states in the country,” he said.
