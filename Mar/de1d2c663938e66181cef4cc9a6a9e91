By AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna Kaduna State Government has confirmed the killing of one ‘Rufai Maikaji,’ a deadly bandit who commanded over a hundred fighters in the state. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said ‘Rufai Maikaji’ and dozens of his fighters were neutralised during air interdictions around the fringes of Malul Forest in Igabi LGA of Kaduna Central Senatorial District. The aerial missions in which ‘Rufai Maikaji’ and his gang were neutralised were conducted in late February when he and the bandits under his command, on sighting ground troops, escaped from Anaba village of Igabi LGA where they killed some citizens, burnt houses and kidnapped some locals. According to Aruwan: “The prompt response by the air platforms ended the reign of terror maintained by ‘Rufai Maikaji’ and his bloodsucking accomplices. “From further checks, ‘Rufai Maikaji’ and his group were confirmed to be responsible for the killing, kidnapping and cattle rustling in many communities in Giwa, Igabi and Chikun LGAs, especially in the following locations: Iyatawa, Garke, Kumfa, Bakali, Karau-karau and Galadimawa, Anaba, Kerawa, Hashimawa, Sabon Birni, Buruku general area and parts of Chikun LGA axis of Kaduna-Birnin Gwari Road. “Rufai Maikaji is said to have begun his ignoble career as an errand boy to some deadly bandits in and around Sabon Birni general area of Igabi LGA. From this position, he grew to become a household name in banditry. “The Kaduna State Government, military, police, DSS and all agencies have assured residents of the communities that suffered the brutality of ‘Rufai Maikaji’, that aggressive pursuit of other accomplices who escaped the onslaught is in full swing, and they will be caught sooner rather than later.”
