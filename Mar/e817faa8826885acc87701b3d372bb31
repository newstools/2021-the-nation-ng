NATIONAL President of Yoruba Welfare Group (YWG) Abdulhakeem Alawuje has urged Southwest governors to declare a state of emergency on food production. Southerners, he said, must return gradually to the farm. He said: “We are calling on our governors, traditional rulers, National Assembly members, ministers to collaborate with us in this mission to attain food sufficiency in Southwest. “In the North, millions of young famers are becoming multi-millionaires; we must empower our people through farming.”  This, he said, would make the Southwest self-sustaining on food production. Alawuje said YWG had mandated its committee Chairman on Employment and Economic Development, Sheikh Abdulfatah Thanni, to find a solution to the challenge Alawuje urged Southwest farmers to venture into animal husbandry, such as cattle, rabbit, goats, snail and fishing, as this would generate employment and reduce criminality in the region.
