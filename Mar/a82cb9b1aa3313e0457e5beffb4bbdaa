There were sighs of relief on Friday at headquarter of Ado Local government in Igirigiri area of Ado-Ekiti, the state capital following the interventions of relevant stakeholders including Governor Kayode Fayemi. The workers had shunned duty posts on the directive of Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees in the state as political thugs invaded the council when some councilors were suspected to be perfecting impeachment plot against the council boss, Mrs. Omotunde Fajuyi. At a joint meeting held at the Secretariat on Friday, which indicated the end of the crisis, the council boss, dismissed the rumour that the councilors wanted to impeach her over alleged embezzlement of funds. Fajuyi said, though the seeming crisis had been laid to rest, but she was still prepared to appear before the legislature to clear herself of any allegation. She added; “It was true that I was invited by the councilors through a letter and I had wanted to meet with them when the incident happended. “They raised the issue of appropriation, which didn’t emanate from my office. I am not a sole administrator and couldn’t be the only one that would do the whole hog of appropriation process in the council. “I believe in openness and I am ready to appear before the councilors, and I will still appear. While should I run away. Except you have accomplices, no chief executive can steal all alone.Though, I am the last approval authority, but I still have checks and balances , so those allegations were spurious.”
