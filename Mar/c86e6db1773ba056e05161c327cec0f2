Popular OAP, Daddy Freeze, has said younger women will not endure suffering like their older counterparts. The controversial radio pointed out the previous male generation had a free will to enjoy their marriage to the detriment of their wives who endured a lot for the sake of their children and public opinions. Daddy Freeze, in an Instagram post, wrote: “Men in previous generations enjoyed their marriages while women endured them. The millennials are not going to endure the nonsense the last generation endured, if you don’t treat a woman well they will leave you. Know this and know peace. “Many women stayed in dead, torturous marriages to men who would abuse them physically, emotionally, and sexually, while cheating on them repeatedly, for the sake of the children or public perception and validation. “Try this today and your partner would leave you quicker than you knew what hit you. Not because your partner doesn’t respect the sanctity of marriage but because your partner won’t take your shit, Simple! “If you are searching for someone to take your shit then marriage is not for you. Fix yourself or get the boot, it’s actually quite simple and straightforward”.
