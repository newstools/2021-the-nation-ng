No fewer than three people have been confirmed dead while three others were hospitalised as cholera broke out in the Oke-Gada area in Ede North Local Government Area of Osun State on Monday. The Nation gathered that the sudden death of beggars around the area caused confusion as some residents are suspecting food poisoning. A resident said, “about 12 beggars have been hospitalised after some of them died. It seems they are poisoned because we have never experienced such an issue in our community before”. Another resident, named Dare, said, “I got to know about the issue on Monday evening, I learnt that some beggars took food from an unknown person and after that, some are dead while others were hospitalised.” When The Nation contacted the spokesperson of Nigeria Police, Osun State Command, Mrs. Yemisi Opalola, she disputed the claim of food poisoning. She said, “The Divisional Police Officer of Ede visited the Seriki of Hausa in the community over the incident because they did not report the matter to the police. The Seriki informed him that it was a Cholera outbreak and not food poisoning. “Three people are dead while three others are in the hospital. We are still investigating the matter.”
