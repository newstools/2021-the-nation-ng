The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) Worldwide has condemned the assassination attempt on its National Treasurer, Comrade Timilaemi Ebifoubo, and the subsequent murder of his uncle, Mr Omolojo Etolo. In a statement on Tuesday by its national spokesman, Comrade Ebilade Ekerefe, the attack happened recently at Ebifoubo’s community in Amabulou, Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. Ekerefe frowned at the unfortunate incident and therefore called on the Nigeria Police and other relevant security agencies to swing into action by arresting and prosecuting the culprits, claiming that the council had names of three suspects connected to the attack. He noted that available information at their disposal indicated that the suspects were unperturbed by their actions and were allegedly still holding the entire community hostage. He claimed that the development had degenerated into looting and destruction of properties, regretting that the people of Amabulou were currently living in perpetual fear. Ekerefe noted: “There is now a complete breakdown of law and order in the community which should not be tolerated considering the rich cultural and traditional importance of the community that predates modern history in Ijaw land. “The IYC observes that if steps are not taken urgently to forestall normalcy in the community by the relevant authorities, the situation is capable of spiraling out of control. “IYC also calls on the Bayelsa State government to intervene and bring normalcy back to the once peaceful community. “The arrowheads accused of carrying out this heinous crime have forcefully taken over Amabulou community and the people are living in fear and trepidation. The culprits must be brought to book urgently to avoid breakdown of law and order.”
