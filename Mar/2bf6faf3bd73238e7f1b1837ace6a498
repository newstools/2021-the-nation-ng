President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to deploy the funds looted by ex-Governor James Ibori, but returned to Nigeria by the British Government, to the completion of many abandoned Federal Government projects in Delta State. A group of Delta State indigenes, under the aegis of Urhobo Progressive Union (UPU), argued that the Federal Government’s plan to apply the recovered funds to the completion of projects outside the state would amount to double jeopardy for the Delta people. UPU’s position is contained in a letter for appeal, sent to Buhari and copied the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice. They named some federal projects that require urgent attention and revival within Delta State to include the Sea Ports, Steel Complex, Gas plant and Petroleum Refinery.
