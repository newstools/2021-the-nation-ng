A GoFundMe fundraiser set up by supporters of Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, has generated heated controversy. The Nation had reported a blogger, Maureen Badejo, few weeks ago, set up a Gofundme page to raise £100,000 (N51.8m) to buy buses in support of Sunday Igboho’s project of ridding the South-West of killer herdsmen. Igboho, during a virtual town hall meeting, had said he needs buses to “transport people” for his south-west tour. “I need buses to transport people. The three vans we use were bought by me. We lost three buses that were hired on our way to Oyo,” he said. In the now-viral video posted by Kayode Ogundamisi, a political commentator on twitter, showed there was a squabble over money between a lady and Yomi Koiki, Sunday Igboho’s spokesman. The lady alleged N2.5 million was given to Igboho but he did not acknowledge receipt even after he admitted collecting another N6.5 million from a Yoruba group in the US. ‘’Yoruba liberation should not be a money-making venture,’’ Badejo said in the video. She alleged Koiki failed to acknowledge N2.5m donated for “feeding” for over 2 weeks, after he allegedly described the funds as “no big deal.” “It is an insult to say N2.5 million feeding money is not a big deal,” Badejo said. This led to the labelling of Badejo, who raised the fund as a ‘fraudster’ which informed her petition to the fundraising platform. Badejo reportedly gofundme to return the £46,933 raised for Igboho to donors. Sunday Igboho’s spokesman, Koiki, could not be immediately reached for comments. Efforts to reach him proved abortive.
