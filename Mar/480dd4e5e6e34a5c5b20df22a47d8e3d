   Super Eagles defender Leon Balogun has promised that the team would minimize mistakes against Benin Republic in  Saturday’s  2021 AFCON qualifier  at Stade Charles de Gaulle in Porto Novo. Hunted by the ill-fated match against Sierra Leone in Benin City last November when the Super  Eagles gave up a four-goal lead for the visitors cruised to a dramatic 4-4 draw, the Rangers Glasgow  star =said that the Eagles are motivated to win away from home this time. “I don’t think we will reinvent football against Benin Republic because this is a new match and it is about minimizing mistakes we  made against the Sierra Leone,” he explained. “I know a lot of people will disagree on popular opinion but the Sierra Leone game wasn’t that bad because you can’t just score four goals and dominate a game like that. “It was just that something happened on that day and things went side-ways. There were mistakes made collectively and we are trying to eradicate this by learning from them in advancing our game. “It doesn’t help anyone to keep going back to the Sierra Leone game.  “There is a match on Saturday and we want to  focus on our strength on that . We will minimize mistakes and focus on our strength. “We will put Benin into trouble by asking them questions throughout the game frequently that they come short to answer. We are going to go all out and hopefully this will look different from what happened against Sierra Leone,” Balogun said. In readiness for the two AFCON ties against Benin and Lesotho, the former Brighton of England defender added: “We are working towards six point because we want the best for the team and for each other; so that is the objective and that is what we try to do. “We are 100 percent motivated in terms of preparation and it is left for our coaches to prepare us for next games by making sure everybody is up to speed on how we want to approach the game and make sure we win it.”
