The Oluwo of Iwo Oba AbdulRasheed Akanbi has accused some unnamed leaders of “sponsoring crisis in Yoruba land because of 2023 presidential election.’’ The agenda, he said, is to prevent the southwest from producing the best presidential candidate in 2023. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Alli Ibraheem, the monarch however said: “Some Yoruba leaders who are beating the drum of war and sponsoring crisis in Nigeria for selfish political reason will not end well.” He added: “All the hues and cries on security challenges in the Southwest region were about the 2023 presidential election. “Those who are singing discordant tune are doing so because of personal aggrandizement. “We know some Yoruba leaders who are calling for war for political reason. It is all about the 2023 presidency. Because they feel someone wants to become President and they don’t want him. “It is because they know that the next president of this country will be Yoruba and they don’t want that to happen. “The person they are accusing has not even come out to say that he wants to be President so why all hatred?” The monarch warned those leaders fanning ember of discord to desist in the interest of national unity. He said: “Some bad elders are sponsoring crisis in Yoruba land because of political reason and self-aggrandisement. I will not allow war to come to Yoruba land or Nigeria. Stop beating the drum of war or you will not end well. “You see people have to be very careful because we will never support anyone that wants to disrupt the peace of the land. “Anyone who wants to destroy the Southwest and particular, Lagos state will not end well.”
