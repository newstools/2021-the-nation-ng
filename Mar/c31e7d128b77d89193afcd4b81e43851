Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde has declared he doesn’t give a hoot about losing re-election in 2023. Makinde, who failed in his governorship bids in 2007, 2011 and 2015, said: “If the people of Oyo State ask me to leave the office as governor today, I won’t hesitate to leave the office because I go to office daily with my bag.” He spoke at the pan-Yoruba Congress at Mapo Hall, Ibadan declaring he has no godfather. According to him: “Let me tell you here today. I don’t have a political father. It was God who made me governor and not human being. I fear only God and not any human. No matter how powerful a man is, I cannot fear him. “I contested election in 2007, 2011 and 2015 but failed and when it is time for God to make me a governor, he made me. “If the people of the state decided that they don’t want me again, I will only take my bag and leave because I don’t have a pin in the office.”
