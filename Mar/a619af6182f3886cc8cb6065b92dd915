The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Anambra State has commenced a special operation against rickety vehicles on major roads in the state. The Sector Commander, Mr. Andrew Kumapayi, who disclosed this on Tuesday in a press briefing, said the exercise followed a directive from Abuja headquarters instructing the Command to ensure rickety vehicles were cleared off the roads. He described such vehicles as nuisance on the roads, insisting on their removal or repairs to avoid falling victim of being impounded. “Such vehicles that are not roadworthy constitute nuisance on the roads, and many a times cause fatal crashes involving lives. The command will not hesitate to impound such vehicles if seen on the roads,” he said. Kumapayi further assured that tricycle operators would undergo continuous trainings to ensure they operated effectively and efficiently, warning that the law against tricycle operators plying the highways was still in place. He commended the state government for its efforts towards the training package for the tricycle operators.
