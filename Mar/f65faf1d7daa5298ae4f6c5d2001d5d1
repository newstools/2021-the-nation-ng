Feelers reaching Sentry from Enugu, Enugu State capital, suggest commissioners in the cabinet of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi are anxiously waiting for the outcome of a planned massive cabinet shake-up. According to sources within the administration, the governor had, on a number of occasions, given indications that he planned to reconstitute his cabinet soon. It was gathered that owing to some recent developments within the government and the party in the state, some commissioners are uncomfortable with the planned shake-up as they fear they may not make it back. Thus, not a few are now waiting on Ugwuanyi to know what would become of them after the planned re-jig of the administration. Sources say some commissioners and cabinet members with political links to former governor Sylvanus Chime are most terrified by the news of a looming cabinet shake-up. This may not be unconnected with some developments between the two camps of late. “They fear they may be dropped on account of their political affiliations with the former governor. I don’t know how founded this fear is but some recent development have been fueling such anxiety within the ruling party in Enugu state,” a source claimed.
