A teenager has been taken into police custody in Ondo State on suspicion of stealing money from victims’ bank accounts using stolen SIM cards. The suspect, Omisakin Samson, was arrested after he allegedly withdrew N44,000 from a victim’s bank account using a stolen SIM card. Samson said he received 18 SIM cards from armed robbers but could only withdraw money from some of the cards. The names of the robbers were given as Isaac Monday and Ajilogba Wande. They were paraded at the Ondo Police headquarters in Akure. Samson claimed he studied Mass Communication at the Ibadan Polytechnic but couldn’t further his education because of poor funding. He said he took to internet fraud to make ends meet. His words, “My mother has stroke and my father is no longer taking care of me. I started with Yahoo and I did it regularly. I studied computer operation and engineering where I learnt about hacking. I used applications to run victims sim cards. I used the SIM to withdraw the cash through POS or used it to buy cards. “I collected 18 SIMs from them but many of them were not useful while some were useful. The one that brought me here was the one I collected N44,000 from. I took N4000 cash and used the rest to buy goods. In this case I used somebody’s account and it was tracked to us. “When I see my victims now, I will beg them and tell them I will not do it again. I feel sorry when spending my victims’ money.”
