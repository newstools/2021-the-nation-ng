Nigeria international Kelechi Iheanacho has described his partnership with Jamie Vardy as great even as both strikers are set to lead Leicester attack against Sheffield United. Iheanacho has been a vital figure for Leicester over recent weeks, scoring an equaliser at both Burnley and Brighton & Hove Albion, as City collected four points from successive fixtures on the road. In both outings, the Nigeria international has started alongside Jamie Vardy, the Club’s all-time top Premier League goalscorer, and Iheanacho admits it is a partnership which he enjoys participating in. “I love to play with Jamie,” the 24-year-old said. “He creates a space for me to come in to pick the ball up, to make strides behind him, so I really like playing with Jamie. He gives me so many options on the pitch. We can score goals together, so I enjoy playing alongside him.” When City took on the Blades at Bramall Lane earlier this season, a last-gasp effort from Vardy was required to seal a 2-1 victory in Yorkshire, and Iheanacho anticipates a similarly difficult, if slightly different, challenge this time around. “The last time we played them it was quite tough,” he explained. “We came back and won the game in the last minute. This one is going to be a different game as well. They’re trying to get off the bottom of the table, so it’s going to be a tough game and a different game. We need to be ready to fight to get the points that we need.” While Leicester went two games without a victory – against Arsenal and Burnley – last weekend’s success at Brighton represented City’s 16th top-flight win this season and Iheanacho is keen for more.
