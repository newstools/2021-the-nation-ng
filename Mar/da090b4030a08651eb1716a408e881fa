Cristiano Ronaldo answered his critics and blew Cagliari away, scoring a Juventus hat-trick in the first 32 minutes. For the first time, Juve started Federico Chiesa, Dejan Kulusevski, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alvaro Morata together. It took under 10 minutes to break the deadlock. CR7 was booked moments later for dangerous play, as he went in high to meet a Chiesa cross, clattering Alessio Cragno in the face, leaving him with a cut to the chin. Morataâ€™s finish was too weak and straight at Cragno, then the Spaniard rolled across for Ronaldo, who was caught by the goalkeeper for a penalty. Ronaldo converted it himself with sheer power, despite Cragno getting something on it.
