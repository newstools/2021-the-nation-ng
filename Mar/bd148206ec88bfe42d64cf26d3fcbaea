Former Deputy Speaker of Ondo State House of Assembly, Iroju Ogundeji, has denied reports that he and eight other lawmakers went to Owo, the hometown of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, to beg to be forgiven. He said there was no reason for them to beg the governor when they have not offended him. The nine lawmakers pitched tent with former Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, and ensured the impeachment plot against him failed. They were suspended from legislative activities, but the court reinstated them. An earlier report said the nine lawmakers were at Owo to beg Governor Akeredolu. But Ogundeji said they were invited to the meeting at the instance of the governor through the Assembly leadership. Ogundeji said it was their constitutional right to support the former deputy governor. He said: “We have no reason to beg the governor. The meeting at Owo was initiated by the governor though the leadership of the House requesting us to meet with the governor. “The meeting was not meant to beg the governor. We didn’t offend him. We have not done anything to warrant us to beg him. It was our constitutional right to support the former deputy governor.” But Chairman, House Committee on Information and Orientation, Olugbenga Omole, said the Owo meeting was at the instance of the aggrieved nine members and was attended by all the 26 elected lawmakers.
