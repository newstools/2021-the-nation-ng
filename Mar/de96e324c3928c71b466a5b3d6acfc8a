 The Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu has directed the Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of Police, Zone 2, Onikan, Lagos to take over the case between the Forum of Mobile Advert Practitioners and AGLGON/NULGE Task Force. ALGON is the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria, while NULGE is the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees. The mobile advert practitioners and the local governments have been at loggerheads over who has the right to collect vehicular dues on behalf of local governments in the country. The police chief ordered the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Force Criminal Investigation Department, FCID, Abuja to hands off the matter. The directive followed a petition written by the leadership of the Forum of Mobile Advert Practitioners led by Otunba Mike Osimen Eboziegbe against the ALGON/NULGE Task Force over alleged illegal collection of vehicular dues by the latter. Adamu’s directive was contained in a letter dated January 18, 2021.. The DIG and FCID, Abuja wrongly took over the case following a counter-petition by the ALGON/NULGE task force. The IGP has said that petition was a “deceitful and fraudulent attempt to move a matter being investigated under the express directive of the Inspector General of Police…In order to avoid duplication of Investigation and abuse of police process, the DIG, FCID, Abuja should stand down investigation while the AIG, Zone 2, Onikan, Lagos, should harmonise the petitions from contending parties, conclude investigation and furnish detailed Investigation report.” The Forum of Mobile Advert Practitioners of Nigeria accused the ALGON/NULGE Task Force of usurping its duties and harrassing its members, even impounding vehicles and motorcycles and extorting the vehicle owners.
