 The  row between the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) over  stamp duties collection deepened yesterday  as FIRS issued a statement, claiming that it “remains the only federal agency permitted by law to collect Stamp Duties on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria’’. It said: “The FIRS, therefore, urged taxpayers, tax practitioners and the public to ignore this unfortunate attempt to cause confusion by twisting the Minister’s speech”. Efforts to get the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami’s reaction was futile as his Technical Assistant of Information, Dr Femi Adeluyi, did not pick his calls. Over the weekend, it was reported that NIPOST had taken over the administration of stamp duties.  Reacting to this claim, the FIRS called the report fake news and an attempt to create confusion around the administration of stamp duties. According to the FIRS, “NIPOST would henceforth produce the adhesive stamps required by FIRS to denote Stamp Duties. This position is in line with Section 2 of the Stamp Duties Act (as amended by Section 46 of the Finance Act 2020)”. The tax agency said the Minister for Communications and Digital Economy Dr. Isa Pantami was “quoted out of context” in suggesting that NIPOST was now in charge of administering stamp duties in the country.
