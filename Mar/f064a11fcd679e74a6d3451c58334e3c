As part of efforts to ensure Nigerians are aware of the deadly Tuberculosis (TB) disease, especially the fact it is curable and treatment and test is free, the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP) of the Federal Ministry of Health, held a medical outreach programme in Lugbe community of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The outreach was to commemorate 2021 World Tuberculosis Day, with the theme: ‘The clock is ticking’, and slogan – ‘That cough fit be Tuberculosis not COVID, check am oh.’ Chairman of 2021 Tuberculosis Day Committee, Dr Ayodele Awe, said: “We are here to increase awareness on TB. No one needs to die from TB. We are here to tell everyone about the signs and symptoms of TB. Any cough for two weeks is suspected to be TB. “We have provided the equipment to check anyone that is coughing. The test is free of charge. You do not need to go to the hospital to check, we have brought the doctors to you.” The Head of Advocacy, Communication and Social Mobilisation of NTBLCP, Mrs Itohowo Uko, added: “We have been able to sensitise the community on the simple signs of tuberculosis and the need for them to go for a test. “But with what we have done today, and the responses received, we believe that more people will do the right thing whenever they have a cough or know someone that has a cough that has lasted two weeks or more.”
