 Nollywood actress, Mercy Johnson-Okojie recently heaped praises on mothers across the world in commemoration of the 2021 Mother’s Day celebration. “Motherhood is the most important and selfless commitment a woman can make. I am very pleased to see how Indomie is acknowledging and celebrating these incredible mothers today,” she said. The star actress made this known during a visit to Living Fountain Orphanage, Victoria Island alongside members of the Indomie Fan Club. In her remarks, Johnson-Okojie applauded the role mothers play in keeping the home together peacefully. The mother of three also lauded the Indomie brand for recognising the role of mothers and putting together an event to celebrate mothers. To celebrate the 2021 Mother’s Day, the Indomie brand had extended love to the less Privileged kids across the country. Speaking at the event, the National Coordinator of Indomie Fan Club, Faith Joshua said the essence of the visit was for the mothers to extend parental love beyond their biological children to the less privileged ones. “Mother’s Day celebration for us at Indomie was a little different than usual this year. As so many prepared to spend the day with their loved ones by sending a letter, card, or gift items, we thought about celebrating this day with children whose circumstances have denied the privilege of enjoying the warmth and care of biological parents.  The avenue allowed us to show these precious kids how much they are loved and how much they are important by giving them a priceless experience while also celebrating mothers across the country,” she said.
