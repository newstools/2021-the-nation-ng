Benin Republic Coach Michel Dussuyer is optimistic of grinding a win over Nigeria after unveiling his 23-man squad that for Saturday’s Group L AFCON 2021 qualifier in Port Novo. Notable absentees are defender Olivier Verdon who was prevented by his Bulgarian club Ludogorets as well as Melbourne Victory striker Rudy Gesterde while club-less Stéphane Sessegnon has been given a new role in the team as a special guest. “Stéphane Sessegnon is selected with the Benin national team as a special guest. He is not on the list of 23. He is called for his leadership. He will participate in training sessions. I will discuss with him about his feelings,” Dussuyer said. The list is made up of three goalkeepers, eight defenders, six midfielders and six strikers. Ahead of the tie against the Eagles, the coach said: “On Saturday our ambition is to win. It will not be an easy task. We have hopes. Will Stéphane Sessegnon play? I don’t know but I am sure that his presence in the group is important,” declared Dussuyer. Meanwhile, the Beninese government has promised to charter a special outward and return flight for its internationals playing in the French championship. The French authorities at the weekend relaxed their isolation measures for non-European players called up for selection during the next international break. With this development, players in question will be exempted from the quarantine on their return to France, subject to benefiting from daily PCR tests and compliance with a sanitary bubble during their stay in selection. It was this that prompted the Benin Republic government to announce that it will charter a special outward and return flight for its internationals.
