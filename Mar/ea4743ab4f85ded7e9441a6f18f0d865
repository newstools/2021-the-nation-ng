The Imo State commissioner of police, Nasiru Mohammed, has said that the command lost one officer in the late Saturday attack on one of its divisional headquarters at Umuelemai in Isiala Mbano local government area of the state. The CP, who warned perpetrators to stop the wanton burning of police facilities in the state, vowed to fish out the hoodlums responsible for the attack. Speaking through the command spokesman, Orlando Ikeokwu, Mohammed narrated in a statement that on 20/03/21, at about 18.30 hours, hoodlums whose number could not be ascertained, attacked the Divisional Police Headquarters, Isiala Mbano, shooting sporadically. He said that operatives of the division successfully repelled them, adding that after the encounter, it was discovered that the hoodlums destroyed some doors and windows. The police boss, however, said that no arm was taken away. He regretted that one inspector, who was on duty at the time of the attack, was fatally wounded and that the officer gave up the ghost hours later while receiving treatment.
