The “E Choke” and “Tule” coiner, 30BG boss, David Adedeji Adeleke popularly known as DAVIDO or OBO is sailing in the high clouds of his career right now. It is no longer news that he featured in the classic movie of all times, Coming to America 2. This act has even further gone ahead to validate his relevance in the entertainment industry not just in Nigeria but in the diaspora. Most Africans, especially Nigerians have been compelled to watch the movie just to see the performance of DAVIDO. The OBO king was seen in a short video, which he posted on his Instagram page watching himself perform one of his top songs “Assurance” in the movie. The joy and fulfillment were all so evident in his demeanor especially when he had to scream “E Choke” and implored everyone to go out and see the movie. He also added that they should tag him when they see him in the movie. Just this morning, an excited and grateful Nigerian on Twitter with handle @OjaySanya tweeted how he left England because there was no money. A mentor decided to set up a go-fundme account for his university and philanthropist OBO dropped funds to support his fundraiser. He resumed his studies in Afe Babalola University (ABUAD) and finally has just graduated with a first-class. For this singular act, the entire Twitter has gone agog with praises of the 30BG king. Davido has gone ahead to tweet a congratulatory message, saying “Crazy!! Happy for you”. Along with several pictures including that of the young man and himself.” In another tweet, the E Choke coiner was seen saying, “No lie…if you be me, you go dey normal??”
