The voices of Nigerian youth on how they can shape their own future will be heard around the world as
The Institute for Governance and Economic Transformation (IGET), a public policy think tank headed by former presidential candidate Professor Kingsley Moghalu, will host the first Elevating youth voices summit. The summit with the theme: The creative industry, social media and governance holds on April 10, 2021 by 2 pm. It will examine how cultural “influencers” can move beyond social bubbles and utilise their voices and influence to bring about improved governance in the country at large, the organisers said. It will also discuss the increasingly important role of social media in Nigerian national life, and its potential to shape governance and public policy in positive ways. Speakers expected at the summit include musician and entertainment entrepreneur Jude (“M.I.”) Abaga; actress, former beauty queen and good governance activist Regina Askia Williams; on-air personality Sandra Ezekwesili; actress Kate Henshaw; actor Benjamin Joseph and newspaper columnist Gimba Kakanda. Others are the youth social entrepreneur Hamzat (“Hamzy Code”) Lawal; notable #EndSARS personalities Modupe Odele, Rinu Oduola and DJ Switch; the technology lawyer Timi Olagunju and actress Rahama Sadau. Andrew Mwavua, a United States entrepreneur and Matilda Duncan, an on-air personality, will serve as the summit’s moderators. “We all worry about what the future holds for Nigeria’s youth in the face of rising poverty, insecurity and unemployment but it is now time for responsible action,” Moghalu, the former as a Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN). He added: “We plan to have a deep-dive conversation between young people to explore how the gap between the celebrity influence and the difficult realities of life in our country can be bridged”.
