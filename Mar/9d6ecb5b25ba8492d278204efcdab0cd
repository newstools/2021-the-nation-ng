One year after the pipeline explosion in Abule Ado area of Lagos, the Lagos State government has handed-over four hectares of land to the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos for the construction of Bethlehem Girls College that was affected by the incident. The explosion occurred on March 15, 2020. Presenting the land documents to the representatives of the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Commissioner for Special Duties and lnter-Governmental Relations, Mr Tayo Bamgbose-Martins said the decision was in fulfilment of the promise of Governor Babajide Sanwoolu. He explained that the handover took long time because government needed to ensure that the location of the land will be convenient for students and staff of the school.  He admitted that several buildings were affected by the incident, but noted that the damage done to the Bethlehem Girl’s College at Abule Ado, was devastating. While highlighting some immediate interventions by the governor, he said family of each of the 23 deceased persons was presented with a cheque of N2.5 million and paid medical bills of those admitted. “Aside that, 102 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were accommodated at the LASEMA Relief Camp, Agbowa for six months. On exit from the camp, each family and individual was given cash stipends to ease their integration into the society.”
