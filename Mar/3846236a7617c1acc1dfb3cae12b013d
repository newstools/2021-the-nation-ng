Victor Osimhen’s scoring  return against Bologna has received commendations from the Italian press following  Napoli’s 3-1 win on Sunday. The Nigerian who replaced Dries Mertens in the 53rd  minutes netted the second goal in the 65th minutes in Napoli’s 3-1 home win over Bologna has been out due to head trauma he suffered during a Serie A tie against Atalanta in February. Corriere della Sera scored Osimhen  6.5 while describing his goal as splendid. “He closes the game by returning to the goal, his goal, with a restart, sprint and winning shot”,” wrote La Gazzetta dello Sport. The paper added: “First, he creates a serious headache for Danilo and Soumaoro, then he makes fun of them and scores the 2-0, finally he misses the 3-0 goal.” Also, La Gazzetta dello praised Osimhen after his goal against Bologna. “It took Victor Osimhen thirteen minutes to recover Napoli. He did it in his own way, with a burning shot, vainly countered by Danilo, and with a sharp shot, which he did not leave. Skorupski escaped. And he could have even finished with a brace. Osimhen with his speed was devastating; he proved that in spaces he can become lethal. With him, Gattuso has found the depth that is the basis of his game,” the paper wrote. Meanwhile, a foremost Italian journalist Sandro Piccinini told ‘Sky Calcio Club’ that Osimhen added value to Coach Gennaro Gattuso’s team. He said: “Today we saw what Osimhen can give to Napoli. Having a player like that stretches your opponent’s defense, which gives you such a physical reference that Napoli didn’t have. “Precisely for this reason the blue club has invested so much money on the Nigerian striker; it is not that Osimhen was chosen by chance.”
