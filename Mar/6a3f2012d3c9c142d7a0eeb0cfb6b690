Troops of Operation Thunder Strike have reported two armed bandits were neutralised at “Five-Thirty” village in Chikun local government area. This followed the attempted kidnap of four women from the village by the armed bandits. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, made this known in a statement Tuesday evening. Aruwan said the troops responded to a distress call and mobilised swiftly to the area to engage the bandits. Following a gunfight, the bandits abandoned the captives who were then able to escape. “After the skirmish, the corpses of two bandits were recovered, with the others having escaped with possible gunshot wounds. “One soldier sustained a bullet injury to the face during the exchange and is recuperating in hospital. “Governor Nasir El-Rufai received the report with thanks. He commended the troops for the successful interception of the bandits and the rescue of the kidnapped women. He wished the injured soldier a quick recovery,” he stated.
