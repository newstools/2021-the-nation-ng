The  Africa Cup of Nations  QUALIFIES enters its home stretch with  the Super Eagles targeting getting six points from their remaining two matches against  Benin and Lesotho. The team’s first game will  be played at Porto Novo tomorrow where the Super Eagles face the Squirrels  before heading back to  Lagos to welcome the Crocodiles of  Lesotho on the final match day next Tuesday. It is no doubt an “Operation 3-3” as they go for a perfect finish of getting three points from the two matches. Meanwhile, “33 Export Lager” the official beer of the Super Eagles has urged the team to go for a perfect finish of getting all the available six points spread across the two remaining matches. Undoubtedly, that possible feat would give the team a huge psychological boost ahead of the final tournament scheduled for next year in Cameroon.  At the moment, the Super Eagles sit atop Group L with eight points and a successful execution of ‘Operation 33’ will not only assure them of top position and qualification, but will vastly improve their global ranking which offer additional advantage. The Brand Manager, “33” Export Lager Beer Rex Anieke, said the brand as a lead partner of both the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and its lead brand, the Super Eagles, has decided to back Nigeria all the way into the final tournament. “33” Export Lager, the quality beer brand, the official beer of the Super Eagles and known for nurturing friendships among Nigerians is encouraging the national team to pick the maximum three points away against the Squirrels of Benin this weekend and another three points at home few days later in Lagos to resonate with the identity of the “33” Export lager beer,” he remarked. Nigeria won bronze at the last edition of the tournament in Egypt in 2019 after a lone goal win over Carthage Eagles of Tunisia in the third-placed match in Cairo. Nigeria, three time-winners last won the premier continental tournament in 2013 in South Africa.
