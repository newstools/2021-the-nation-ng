Super Eagles manager Gernot Rohr made one late change to the starting lineup for his side’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match against the Republic of Benin at the Stade Charles de Gaulle in Porto-Novo. Everton winger Alex Iwobi was supposed to start in a number 10 role against the Squirrels, but was axed from the game altogether after returning a positive coronavirus test, just before the players and officials headed to the stadium. The Hale End Academy product participated in the team’s final workout in Porto-Novo on Friday evening and was also spotted during the team walk this morning. Galatasaray winger Henry Onyekuru had to come into the starting lineup as a replacement for Iwobi.
