 Kidnappers of the eight members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in Kaduna State have established contact with the leadership of the church, demanding a N50 million ransom for them to free the captives. The eight members of the Church were abducted on the Kachia-Kafanchan highway Friday evening while travelling in the church’s bus. The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday told the Kaduna State government to swing into action immediately and secure their release.  Public Relations Officer in the Kaduna Province of the Church, Mr. Alao Joseph told The Nation last night that the abductors had called the Church’s Regional Pastor to table their demand. Their location is not yet known. Joseph confirmed that the kidnap took place at about 7pm on Friday. The police command in Kaduna said yesterday it had launched   a search for the victims. This was as the Senator who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly, Shehu Sani, lamented that bandits have turned Kaduna State into a hub of kidnapping.
