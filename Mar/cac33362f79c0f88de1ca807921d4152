Juventus are reportedly prepared to accept as little as £25m for Cristiano Ronaldo with the Italian giants bracing themselves for life without the superstar following their latest Champions League exit. Ronaldo, 36, joined the all-conquering Italians from Real Madrid in 2018, with Old Lady chiefs hopeful that the Portuguese could help them to clinch an elusive Champions League title. However, Juve’s performances in European football’s premier competition have dramatically slumped since Ronaldo’s arrival, with the Italians failing to advance past the quarter finals in each of the last three seasons. And reports in Italy suggest that the reigning Serie A champions are tempted to cut Ronaldo loose this summer, with Paris Saint-Germain interested in landing the four-time Ballon d’Or winner.  According to Corriere dello Sport via Football Italia, Juventus will accept an offer as low as £25m to part ways with the 36-year-old, with any less than that sum resulting in a capital loss for the club. Ronaldo’s current contract with the club expires in June 2022, with the club not looking at extending that deal at present. Meanwhile, reports in Spain says that Jorge Mendes, agent of Ronaldo, has held talks with Real Madrid over a sensational return. Ronaldo helped guide Zinedine Zidane’s side to four Champions League titles in five seasons, smashing goal records along the way. Juventus CEO Fabio Patratici said this week: ‘Fortunately, there is still a year on Ronaldo’s contract, so we have time to talk to him. That’s not a priority right now.’
