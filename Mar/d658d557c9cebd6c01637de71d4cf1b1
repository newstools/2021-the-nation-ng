Ogun State Government has said the ongoing construction of a flyover across the Sagamu-Ore-Benin Expressway, linking Ijebu-Ode/Epe Road, by the current administration, will be completed by the third quarter of the year. It said when the flyover is completed; it will ease vehicular movements and reduce accidents for commuters travelling from the eastern part of Nigeria to Lagos and those transiting to Sagamu and Ijebu-Ode. Governor Dapo Abiodun made this known during inspection of road projects in Ijebu-Ode. He said the Ijebu-Ode/Epe Road would be completed in May. The road, according to the governor, would decongest Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, enhance the industrialisation of the state and also increase the commercial value of the axis.
