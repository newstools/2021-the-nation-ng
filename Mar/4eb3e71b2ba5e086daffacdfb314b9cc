A worldwide Christian organisation, Imani Bridges, has offered over 6,000 Badagry residents free medication and vocational training during its six days evangelical project tagged: “The Badagry Great Visitation”. The Executive Director, Missions Aid International, Dr. Emmanuel Nwachukwu, said the transformational programme was to change the face of Badagry residents. ”God gave a vision to Imani Bridges to do a transformational programme in Badagry. We saw that things were not moving well, government presence was lost and most residents are not in church. God said we should do a project that will bring transformation back to the town. So we have been coming to Badagry since 2016. ”We have been coming yearly to do vocational training, free medicare and community service. ”This year we have given quality and quantity in term of medicare, vocational training and we have worked on youths and the children. “Over 6,000 indigenes have benefited from our transformational projects. We have given free glasses to people with eye problems and medication of sickness,’ he said.
