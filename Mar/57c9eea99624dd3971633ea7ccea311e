The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has deplored Saturday’s attack on Benue Governor Samuel Ortom. The Governor was said to have been attacked at Tyo-Mu along Makurdi-Gboko road in Makurdi Local Government Area of the state. The NGF empathised with Ortom but demanded that no effort should be spared to apprehend those behind the attack. The Governors’ position is contained in a statement on Sunday by the NGF’s secretariat signed by its chairman and Ekiti Governor Kayode Fayemi. The statement reads: “The news of the broad daylight attempt to cut short the life of the Governor of Benue State, Dr Samuel Ortom, is shocking and a rude awakening. “All hands must be on deck to uncover the identities of those involved in this heinous crime. “The NGF wishes to state categorically that the attempt to make Benue State ungovernable is unacceptable and will fail woefully. “Only recently the brother of one of the former governors of the state was mowed down in cold blood. “This dishonourable and shameful act of resorting to violence, for whatever reason, to eliminate citizens of Benue State by brutal means must not continue.”
