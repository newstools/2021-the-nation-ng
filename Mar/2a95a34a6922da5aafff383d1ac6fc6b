Rangers star Leon Balogun insists that winning the title doesn’t mean Steven Gerrard’s side will be sitting back and putting their feet up, and aims to bring more silverware to Ibrox. Days after the club’s first title triumph in a decade was confirmed, the Nigerian international and his club-mates return to European action against Slavia Prague in the Europa League. Balogun wants to go further than last season when the Gers lost out at this stage to Bayer Leverkusen and thinks the title win can provide a springboard for even more success. “It would be wrong if we just thought, ‘OK, now we’ve won the league, let’s sit back and relax,’” Balogun told the Scottish Sun. “That would be shameful and also disrespectful to the badge. This club stands for success and we’ve been able to dust that badge off a little bit with this title victory.  “Obviously the league has always been the main target, but there are still cups to play for. “Last season the team managed to reach this same stage of the Europa League, so now the next challenge is to advance one step further. “I’m pretty sure, going by how the staffs are speaking and the team is set up, everybody will see this as the beginning of a good run. It’s about saying, ‘Let’s see about bringing as much glory to the club as we can’.” Balogun also admitted that he sees him being at Ibrox next season to help Steven Gerrard’s side defend their title – as well as having a crack at making the Champions’ League group stage. With Balogun only signing a one-year deal when he initially joined the Light Blues and is “pretty confident” there will be news imminently, adding: “I am pretty confident there will be something to talk about soon. I see no reason why I won’t be here.”
