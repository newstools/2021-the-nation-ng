Robert Lewandowski was on the scoresheet again as Bayern Munich cruised into the quarter-finals of the Champions League with a win over Lazio. The striker coolly slotted home a first-half penalty after Leon Goretzka was pushed by Francesco Acerbi. Substitute Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting made it 2-0 in the second half with a chipped finish from close range. Lazio got one back through Marco Parolo late on, but Bayern sailed through with a 6-2 aggregate win. Lewandowski, who was replaced by Choupo-Moting with over 20 minutes remaining, had earlier hit the post with an excellent long-range effort in another threatening performance. His goal – a 13th from the spot in the Champions League – meant Lewandowski has been directly involved in more goals in the competition than any other player – with 20 goals and five assists – since the start of last season. He looked disappointed to be taken off but Choupo-Moting extended Bayern’s lead when he was played through on goal by David Alaba just 121 seconds after coming on. Lazio, who fell to a 4-1 defeat in the first leg in Rome, were much better in the second half – Parolo heading in an inch-perfect free-kick delivery for the goal, before Joaquin Correa was inches away from equalising when he slid in at the near post.
