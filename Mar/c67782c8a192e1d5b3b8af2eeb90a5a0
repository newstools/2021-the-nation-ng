Governor Dapo Abiodun on Monday took delivery of 50,000 vaccine doses out of the 100,000 donated to the state by the Federal Government. Abiodun received the vaccines brought in by the team led by Commissioner of Health, Dr Tomi Coker. The governor said Ogun is the first state to receive the vaccines. He said the remaining 50,000 doses were expected Monday night. He said he and his deputy, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele would take the lead in taking the jabs. “We will commence the vaccinations in line with the scheduled guidelines laid down by NPHCDA. They have identified particular state hospitals, general hospitals, primary health care centres across the state that would be used for this vaccination. “I’m sure you are aware that there is a portal that already exist and there is a link that allows you to register or preregister and identify your local government so it can be close to the available centre as possible. “We will be prioritising our front line health workers, our elders and we go down the line as stipulated by NPHCDA. “Definitely, we are beginning to see the end of this pandemic that has disrupted our lives like we have never anticipated in the last 13 months.”
