Yoruba rights activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has said the time has come for the actualisation of the much-desired Yoruba Nation. He said that there is no basis for ‘one Nigeria’ as insecurity spreads to the southwest region, adding that the only solution is for the Yoruba nation to stand on its own. Igboho in the now-viral video where he was addressing a press conference as obtained by The Nation, reiterated his stance against killer herdsmen in the southwest. “Starting from now, we don’t want herdsmen in our land to disturb our farms again. If we meet any killer herdsmen, we are going to face and destroy them. “If any police attack us for that, we are ready for them. We don’t want Nigeria again, but Yoruba nation. There is no essence for one Nigeria when major resources in the country are in the hands of the northerners.” “Enough is enough, no going back… we are not scared of anybody, these killer herders are taking over our land and they are killing us,” he added.
