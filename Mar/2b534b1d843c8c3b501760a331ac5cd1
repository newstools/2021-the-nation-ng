It was gathered that the gunmen gained entry into the quarters at about 8.15 pm and started shooting sporadically. A source said that three persons were kidnapped, including a woman and her husband. The husband and the other staff were later managed to escape while the gunmen went away with the woman. The source said there was a prompt response from the security agents who went on the trail of the gunmen.
