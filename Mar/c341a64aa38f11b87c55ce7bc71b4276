Nigeria international striker Victor Osimhen has blamed opposing defenders for incurring a late yellow in Napoli 2-0 away win over Roma in the Serie A on Sunday. The 21-year-old forward replaced Dries Mertens, who had scored a brace to give Napoli an important win in the battle for Champions League next season. But Osimhen was shown a yellow card for pushing Roma defender Gianluca Mancini in stoppages and he said: “He went in hard on me twice.” “He went in hard on me twice, I felt it and he was denying that he didn’t do it,” Osimhen said. “That got me so angry.” Meanwhile, Osimhen has confirmed he will take part in the AFCON qualifier games against Lesotho and Benin Republic.
