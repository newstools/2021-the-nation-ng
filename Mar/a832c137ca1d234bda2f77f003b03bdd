 In Ilorin, Kwara State faith-based Al-Hikmah Univer sity is partnering security agents to ensure security of lives and property on its campuses. Its Vice Chancellor Prof Noah Yusuf said this in Ilorin, the state capital, on this year matriculation of the school. Yusuf added that the institution had a high lead on its students enrolment for the first time in the last eight years. He warned the new intakes to eschew anti-social behaviour like drug abuse, cultism, theft and others, adding that the university has zero tolerance to social vices. “Anyone caught engaging in any misconduct will either be rusticated or dismissed and handed over to law enforcement agencies for prosecution,” he added. He said: “For the first time in the past eight years, we had a leap in the students’ enrolment this year. This leap is not connected with COVID-19 pandemic or ASUU strike, it is rather based on the grace of almighty God. “This year, we have matriculated 1005 students. I should also add that admission is still on. The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) gave us a caveat that admission for private universities closes May 2021 and we are still in March. ‘’We set a target of 2000 students enrolment, but we thank God that with over 50 percent, it is okay. We are on course. “The breakdown is as follows: Faculty of Agriculture 90; Faculty of Education is 122, Faculty of Health Sciences 212; Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences 181; Faculty of Law 64; Management Sciences 82 and Natural and Applied Sciences 244.”
