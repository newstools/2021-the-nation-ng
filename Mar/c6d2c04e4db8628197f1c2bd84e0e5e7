 The Debt Management Office (DMO) has raised N362.57 billion in less than three years for the rehabilitation and construction of major economic roads across the country. The money was raised through the issuance of Sovereign Sukuk. A statement from the DMO noted that “by issuing Sovereign Sukuk, the product range available to investors in the domestic financial market has increased, while, several retail investors have been attracted to the financial markets”. Giving the success recorded in past Sovereign Sukuk issuance, the DMO yesterday listed its third Sovereign Sukuk “N162.557 billion seven-year 11.200 per cent AL Ijarah Soveriegn Sukuk Due2027” on The Nigerian Stock Exchange and the FMDQ Securities Exchange. “The Sukuk which at the time of issuance was massively subscribed to the tune of N669.124 billion or 446 per cent, was issued to finance 44 economic road projects across the six -geopolitical zones”.  With the listing, investors who are already holding the SUKUK can trade them while new investors now have an opportunity to buy the SUKUK in  the secondary market. The DMO started the issuance of Sovereign Sukuk in September 2017 as one of the measures towards attaining its strategic objective of bridging the infrastructure gap in Nigeria to promote job creation and economic growth. Following the successful issuance of the N100 billion debut Sukuk in 2017, the DMO issued another N100 billion Sukuk in 2018. The proceeds of the two Sukuks were deployed to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of road projects across Nigeria. The DMO has assured that it will continue to provide “funding for the government, as approved from time to time, to finance the development of infrastructure whilst also deepening the domestic financial markets and mobilising savings”.
