 Property worth millions of naira was gutted by fire after a petrol tanker fell and burst into flames in Ekwuoma town, Ika North East council area of Delta State. It was learnt yesterday that the truck driver was trying to avoid a vehicle when he lost control and the vehicle overturned, spilling its contents and burst into flames. The fire spread rapidly to a residential building close-by and razed it.  A man identified as Saliu Muhammed who was fast asleep was rescued unhurt from a building in the vicinity. An eyewitness identified simply as Mrs Ndudi said, “I was coming from the opposite direction and met my neighbour’s children by the roadside. I asked them to wait, so they were playing with me. The tanker was coming from Asaba to Agbor. What we heard was a loud sound. As it fell, dust covered everywhere. “The next thing we saw was fire.” No one died in the incident.
