Nigeria’s  Quadri Aruna has been pitched against India’s Sathiyan Gnanasekaran in the main draw of the World Table Tennis (WTT) Middle East Hub taking place in Doha, Qatar. Aruna is the only African left in the $200,000 prize-money tournament  after his compatriot Olajide Omotayo  as well as Egypt’s Omar Assar and Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw exited  in the preliminary round of the men’s singles. Aruna who is among the 24 top players seeded for the tournament, will tomorrow square up against the 28-year-old Indian star ranked 37th in the world. “I am surely going to give my best against the best; in table tennis, nothing is sure but with determination and hardwork as well as some luck, one can be sure of progressing in each stage of the tournament,” Aruna said. The WTT Contender Series, features two event tiers – WTT Star Contender and WTT Contender – that are set to deliver world-class competition. Aruna and other top players will battle it out for ITTF Table Tennis World Ranking points, as up-and-coming stars of the sport look to rise up the ladder. The WTT Star Contender events will take place over six days and WTT Contender events will deliver four days of action, with each event featuring men’s and women’s singles, men’s and women’s doubles and mixed doubles competitions.
