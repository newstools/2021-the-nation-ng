Vice Chancellor,  University of Calabar (UNICAL), Prof. Florence Obi has intensified efforts to reposition the institution’s entrepreneurial education to ensure  students become enterprise-driven. Speaking during an entrepreneurship workshop to address challenges faced by youths and create employment opportunities, the VC stressed the importance of entrepreneurial studies. She noted that there had been a paradigm shift from an analogue path to a digital system in the institution, adding that the university’s syllabus has changed to a modern and more practical one. She also said the university’s entrepreneurship centre was remodelled to ensure graduates who passed through the centre would have added advantage in the labour market. She said: “We are remodelling our entrepreneurship development centre, such that any student who graduates from the university would not just pass through the  centre, but would actually gain skills. “Also, students will be recommended to the entrepreneurship centre for skill acquisition to enable them become marketable.” Obi also said the curriculum was already structured, noting  that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) had been signed with the centre  to train the varsity’s students and ensure advancement in the labour market.
