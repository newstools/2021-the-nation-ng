 Sergio Aguero will leave Manchester City at the end of the season, the club have confirmed. The 32-year-old’s contract at the Etihad Stadium will expire in the summer when he will leave on a free transfer. Aguero, City’s record goal scorer with 257 goals in 384 games following his arrival from Atletico Madrid in 2011, has been linked with moves to Juventus and Barcelona. “Sergio’s contribution to Manchester City over the last 10 years cannot be overstated,” said chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak. “His legend will be indelibly etched into the memories of everyone who loves the Club and maybe even in those who simply love football. “This is not yet the moment for farewell words and speeches. There is still much to achieve in the remainder of the time we have with Sergio, and we look forward to his contributions to the challenges which lay ahead.”  Aguero has been blighted with injury problems for more than a year and has been limited to just eight Premier League appearances this season, scoring once. He has started just two games since October. The club have confirmed that the striker will have a statue at the Etihad Stadium alongside former team-mates Vincent Kompany and David Silva. “It gives me great pleasure to announce that we will be commissioning an artist to create a statue of Sergio to live at the Etihad Stadium alongside the ones under construction for Vincent [Kompany] and David [Silva],” added Al Mubarak. “And we look forward to the opportunity to bid Sergio a fitting farewell at the end of the season.”
