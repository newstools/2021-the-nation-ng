Not less than 100 persons escaped death by the whiskers as an improvised explosive device yesterday exploded at Umuola community Hall in Aba North Local Government of Abia State, during the bye-election for House of Representatives for Aba North and South Federal Constituency. The incident, which occurred at about 12 noon, sent both the ad-hoc staff, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and early voters to scamper for safety. Though no life was lost, the improvised device, which was reportedly tied in a white polythene bag, was said to have damaged the ballot box containing ballot papers, INEC cubicle among other things. Some of the survivors, including Mr. Eze Isiguzo, Mrs. Blessing Owen and Mrs. Oluchi Nwagwu, told our correspondent that their escape was divine. According to Mr. Isiguzo, “I was just standing here when a man standing next to me raised the alarm as smoke was coming out from a nylon bag on top of this soak. Before we could know what was happening, we heard a loud sound that sent everyone scampering for safety. “The police, INEC staff and others all ran away because no one was expecting that kind of a thing to happen. “As we speak, I can’t hear very well. But the good news is that nobody was injured.” Nwagwu and Owen, who corroborated Isiguzo’s account, said the incident scared people away from coming to vote. The two female survivors disclosed that some heads of various security agencies in the state had visited the place after the incident and assured the electorate of their safety. An official of one of the security agencies in the state confirmed the incident and assured that the situation has been put under control, while assuring voters and residents of their safety.
