The Department of State Services (DSS) has invited leaders of the Amalgamated Union of Foodstuff and Cattle Dealers of Nigeria for blocking the supply of foodstuff and cattle from the North to the South. The blockade, which has entered its fourth day, was in protest against the alleged killing of their members in the South. The General Secretary, AUFCDN, Ahmed Alaramma, said this at a press conference in Abuja on Monday. Alaramma said president of the union, Mohammed Tahir, was with the DSS as at press time. He also said military personnel were intimidating members and task force of the union. He said: “The situation report we are receiving in Zaria Kaduna state, Jabba Niger state, Tala in Taraba state and lokoja in Kogi state is that there are being intimidated by the Nigerian army, they are intimidating our task force “Our dismay is that we wrote to all the security agencies about our strike but unfortunately the Nigerian army are harassing and maltreating us badly. “Our members are being frustrated nationwide by the Nigerian army simply because we embarked on a strike despite our contribution to peace, progress, unity and economic growth of the country. “We reject what the army has done to our task force in all the places mentioned. We want to assure our members that our strike action is ongoing we will not give up until the success of our union is achieved.” He advised the Federal Government to avert looming chaos by stopping the intimidation of their members. The union called on the Federal Government to pay them billions in compensation. They are demanding the payment of N475 billion as compensation for lives of members and property lost during the #EndSARS protest and Shasha market crisis.
