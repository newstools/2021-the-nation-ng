The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) and tertiary institutions across the country have agreed to close admissions for the 2020/2021 academic session on June 15, 2021. This was the consensus at the weekend’s virtual meeting attended by heads of tertiary institutions, JAMB’s Head of Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, announced this in a statement yesterday in Abuja. The statement said the board’s Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, leveraged on the meeting to know the progress tertiary institutions had made on the 2020/21 admissions. It added that the goal of the interactive meeting was to forestall an endless admission regime generated by series of disruptions, especially as caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the statement, the meeting would enable the board to put necessary machinery in place for the 2021/2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME/DE) registration. “After a robust and insightful deliberation, members collectively agreed that all public universities are expected to finish their admissions on or before May 15, 2021, while the private universities and all IEIs, polytechnics and colleges of education (COEs) would complete theirs at the agreed date of June 15, 2021. “Prof. Oloyede reiterated that the chosen deadlines remained sacrosanct and binding on all institutions as the board would not tolerate any breaches of the collective decision reached at the meeting,” the statement said.
