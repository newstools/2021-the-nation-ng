The mouthpiece of Northern Nigeria, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), has lauded the Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle over the bold step taken to remove Emir of Maru, Abubakar Chika and the District Head of Kanoma, Lawal Ahmed for allegedly giving support to bandits. Recall that about a week ago the ACF issued a press release calling on the Zamfara State Governor to name the people collaborating with kidnappers and bandits in his state. The Governor had claimed that he knew those collaborators and that Nigerians will be shocked to know them and ACF in the statement signed by the National Chairman, Chief Audu Ogbe called on the Governor to give the names and let heaven fall. However, in a statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr Emmanuel Yawe and made available to journalists in Kaduna said, “We are happy to note that the government of Zamfara has acted appropriately. “A soldier and his girlfriend have been arrested in Zamfara for supplying arms and military uniforms to bandits. The deputy chief of staff to the Zamfara state governor who represented him at a press conference said the arrest followed information supplied by community-based intelligence. “The governor has also approved the removal of Emir of Maeu, Abubakar China and the district head of Kanoma, Lawal Ahmed for allegedly giving support for bandits responsible for hundreds of deaths. “The Emir and the district head have been on suspension since June last year and were under investigation which found them guilty of the complaints from their subjects that they were collaborating with bandits and kidnappers. “We of the ACF congratulate the Zamfara State government led by Bello Matawalle for these bold steps. We urge him to go ahead with the good work he is doing. The Almighty Allah who does not sleep will protect him. Nothing will happen to him.”
