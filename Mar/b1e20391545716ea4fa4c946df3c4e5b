A constable has been taken into custody in Abia State for allegedly removing rifles from a riot police armoury in Umuahia, the state capital. The Nation reported last week that some persons broke into MOPOL 28 Unit armoury and made away with five AK-47 rifles. Police are now investigating whether or not the thief is one of their own. The constable in custody is believed to be one of the armoury workers but may have connived with other insiders in the removal of the weapons. The suspect was arrested on Monday following investigations. Investigations revealed that the suspect recently bought three tricycles for commercial purposes. Police spokesman Geoffrey Ogbonna did not answer calls to his cellphone nor did he respond to text messages.
