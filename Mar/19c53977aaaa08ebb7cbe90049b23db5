Aston Villa’s European hopes suffered another setback as they were held to a goalless draw by Wolves in their West Midlands derby. The hosts, who suffered a surprise loss to Sheffield United in midweek, dominated the early stages with Ollie Watkins and Ezri Konsa both hitting the crossbar. But with the influential Jack Grealish again missing as he recovers from injury, Villa faded after the break as Wolves sparked into life. Having failed to create a chance of note during the first period, Nuno Espirito Santo’s visitors somehow contrived to miss several gilt-edged chances to snatch all three points. Romain Saiss blazed an effort over the bar from practically on the goal-line after Conor Coady had headed against a post, while another close-range effort from Coady drew a superb save from Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to ensure the spoils were shared. The result leaves Villa ninth in the table on 40 points while Wolves remain 12th, five points further back.
