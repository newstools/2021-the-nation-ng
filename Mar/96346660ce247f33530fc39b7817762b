 The plan to get more Nigerians into the financial services net  via the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) inauguration of the Financial System Strategy 2020 (FSS 2020) has elapsed. But the gains made though the project stays with the financial system. A lot of progress was made on many fronts during the project which ended last year-end. For instance, the CBN efforts at bringing more Nigerians into the banking fold through its financial inclusion strategies have recorded significant progress, with 64 per cent financial inclusion achievement, but lower than 80 per cent target. A survey in Nigeria in 2008 by a development finance organisation, the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access, revealed that about 53 per cent of adults were excluded from financial services. The global pursuit of financial inclusion as a vehicle for economic development had a positive effect in Nigeria as the exclusion rate reduced from 53 per cent in 2008 to 46.3 per cent in 2010. Encouraged by the positive development, the CBN, in collaboration with stakeholders, launched the National Financial Inclusion Strategy  on October 23, 2012 to further reduce the exclusion rate to 20 per cent by 2020. Specifically, adult Nigerians with access to payment services is to increase from 21.6 per cent in 2010 to 70 per cent in 2020, while those with access to savings should increase from 24 per cent to 60 per cent; and Credit from two per cent to 40 per cent, Insurance from one per cent to 40 per cent and Pensions from five per cent to 40 per cent, within the same period. The channels for delivering the above financial services were equally targeted to improve, with deposit money bank branches targeted to increase from 6.8 units per 100,000 adults in 2010 to 7.6 units per 100,000 adults in 2020, Microfinance bank branches to increase from 2.9 units to 5.5 units; Automated Teller Machines from 11.8 units to 203.6 units, Point of Sale (PoS) from 13.3 units to 850 units, Mobile agents from 0 to 62 units, all per 100,000 adults between 2010 and 2020.  The targets were based on bench marking exercise carried out with peer countries, while also taking into consideration critical growth factors in the Nigerian environment. In a major step to achieve these targets, the FSS 2020 was kickstarted  in 2006 by the CBN, in collaboration with other key financial sector regulators to fast track and enhance the growth and development of Nigeria’s financial system as an integral part of the national vision 2020. The strategic vision of FSS 2020 is “to be the safest and most diversified financial system among emerging markets supporting the real economy by the year 2020’’. According to the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, the regulator would not pretend that it is not going to be a daunting challenge to  to achieve 80 percent financial inclusion by 2020, which is one of the scheme’s targets, but a major milestone has been achieved. Emefiele stressed the need for increased collaboration among government agencies and other institutions involved in the FSS 2020. For instance, Nigeria’s Payment System has improved. There is a Central Bank of Nigeria Immediate Transfer Service (CBSITS) and an interbank platform for effecting payment transactions, Electronic Cheque Clearing (ECC) system allowing for a same day cheques-clearing process, Nigeria Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) as an alternative means for interbank funds transfer, among others, including the Real time gross settlement system.
