LAGOS State Materials Testing Laboratory (LSMTL) has said it will create a database for block and clay manufacturers. General Manager Olufunsho Elulade said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had declared zero tolerance to building collapse, hence the need to capture everyone involved in manufacturing and production of construction materials. He spoke during a visit by Nigerian Institute of Builders (NIOB) to the agencyâ€™s Ojodu office.  According to him, the synergy between NIOB and LSMTL was crucial to forestall collapse of buildings. He urged builders to partner the agency to eradicate substandard materials. Elulade said identified buildings with defects would be shut down. NIOB incoming National President Lucky Isiname congratulated Elulade on his appointment and expressed their desire to partner the agency.
