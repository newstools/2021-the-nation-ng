Amoo said: “The match against Bayern Munich academy should not be a yardstick to measure our level because our level in terms of  where we are going is much higher and the game was for us to see our own errors so we can make the necessary corrections. “We have been trying to sort out things, making corrections and trying to strengthen the team and I wished we had opportunity to play the  U-17 of another country before our departure,” he noted.
