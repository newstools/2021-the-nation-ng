Teachers recruited by the Ondo State government under the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) have started collecting their appointment letters. The successful teachers were given their appointment letters after the conduct of an online examination. Chief Press Secretary to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, Olabode Richard Olatunde, who confirmed the distribution of the appointment letters said the online examination was to ensure that the best brains were selected among the applicants. Olatunde said the 1000 newly recruited teachers started collecting their appointment letter since last Friday. He said the teachers were employed to fill vacant positions in all public schools across the state. It was learnt that recruitment of teachers into public schools in Ondo State was last done 13 years ago during the administration of Adefarati.
