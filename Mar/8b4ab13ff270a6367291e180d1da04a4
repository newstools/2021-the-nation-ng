A joint bid from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland to host the 2030 World Cup has received support from the UK Government, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it is the “right time” to “bring football home”. A feasibility study is under way and will continue before the formal bidding process begins next year. Johnson also said that Britain is ready to host extra matches in this year’s European Championships. In an interview with The Sun, Johnson said: “We are very, very keen to bring football home in 2030. I do think it’s the right place. “It’s the home of football, it’s the right time. It will be an absolutely wonderful thing for the country.” The English Football Association said on Twitter that it welcomed “the Government’s pledge of £2.8million towards a potential bid” for the 2030 World Cup. A joint statement released by the FA and the football associations of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland on Monday evening read: “The football associations and Government partners of the UK and Ireland are delighted that the UK Government has committed to support a prospective five-association bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. “We will continue to undertake feasibility work to assess the viability of a bid before FIFA formally open the process in 2022. “Staging a FIFA World Cup would provide an incredible opportunity to deliver tangible benefits for our nations. “If a decision is made to bid for the event, we look forward to presenting our hosting proposals to FIFA and the wider global football community.”
