At AC Milan’s Milanello training base, they are starting to believe they have finally found the heir to Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Nesta — and the man in question’s most successful season to date was in the Championship with Derby. Fikayo Tomori has made a huge impact during his first two months in Italy. The 23-year-old moved on loan from Chelsea in January until the end of the season, with an option to buy. Milan are already very keen to explore that clause and Tomori can further his cause with a strong performance against Manchester United in the Europa League. “Fikayo is a player with interesting qualities,” said Maldini, perhaps the greatest player in Milan’s history and now their technical director. “He is quick, hard-working and was someone we were following closely with January in mind. The deal contains an option to sign him from Chelsea. I’m lucky to work in a club where if a player knows we want them, it makes an impact. “We might not have won anything at European level for 14 years, but Milan is still a historic club.”
