Media Entrepreneur and Executive Producer of the movie ‘Street Kid’, Dickson Edward has spoken on the reason he collaborated with Samuel ‘Bigsam’ Olatunji on his forthcoming film, Mimi. Edward revealed that he joined forces with Bigsam on the Mimi project because Bigsam’s first movie, Dear Affy was fantastic. Speaking on the project, Dickson Edward posited that “The main reason why I joined forces with Samuel Olatunji was that his previous movies Dear Affy and Seven and a Half Dates were a success. You don’t get such individuals every day, one thing I know is that it’s not an easy feat making a movie in Nigeria, let alone making one that would do well at the cinema. Samuel Olatunji made that happen with his previous movies so that explains why I decided to work with him on his new project titled Mimi.” The movie Mimi features Ali Baba, Iretiola Doyle, Ufuoma Mcdermott, Toyin Abraham, Deyemi Okanlawon, Bimbo Akintola, Hafiz Oyetoro, Bianca Ugowanne, Sanyeri, Lateef Adedimeji, Jide Kosoko, Kie Kie, Lizzy Jay, Semilore Adewumi, and a host of other amazing stars. The movie tells the story of a daughter of a billionaire, Mimi who despises poverty and poor people so much, found out her extremely rich parents weren’t her biological parent, and her real parent ‘sold’ her off at a young age to raise some funds to train her siblings, however in a bid to make her more responsible, her rich parents made her spend two weeks holiday with her biological parent who lives in abject poverty.
