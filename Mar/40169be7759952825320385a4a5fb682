Chairman, BUA Group, Abdul Samad Rabiu, has donated N200million to Sokoto State University for the construction of an ICT Faculty Building. According to Rabiu, the state is host to three of BUA Cement’s factories and over the years, it had played a huge role in the growth and success of the company. Therefore, it is also of critical importance that BUA supports the development of talent in future-proof industries for the state such as ICT, research and education. This donation was announced during the university’s 2021 convocation in Sokoto where Rabiu alongside two others, The Emir of Dutse, Alhaji  Nuhu Muhammad Sanusi and the late Alhaji Umaru Ali Shinkafi were conferred with Honorary doctorate degrees for their contributions in various fields. The state Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, thanked Rabiu for the cash and  philanthropy. He also commended BUA’s contributions towards the socio-economic development of the state and urged others to emulate him. He added that the state would continue to create an enabling environment for businesses like BUA to thrive and enjoined other corporates to come and invest in the state. According to him, BUA had built an endearing partnership with the people and government of the state from creating employment opportunities to creating social impact projects, and this donation was very much in line with that.
