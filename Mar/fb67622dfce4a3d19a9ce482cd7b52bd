Two students and a teacher simply identified as Miss Uzo of the Environmental Studies Department of the National Institute for Construction Technology, Uromi in Esan Northeast Local Government Area of Edo have been abducted. The Nation learnt the kidnappers invaded the institute’s main campus along Amedokhian Road, Uromi, amid sporadic gunshots, which caused confusion. The ugly development heightened tension in the area with parents and guardians storming the institute to ascertain the whereabouts of their children and wards. The invasion took place at a time the students were writing their second semester examinations. The kidnapped students also took part in the exam on Wednesday. A former Edo Speaker, Friday Itulah, told The Nation: “The institute is known for excellence. I wonder what made the kidnappers to storm the institution. “I wish to call on the police and other security agencies to beef up security in Esan land and other parts of Edo State.” Itulah, who later represented Esan Northeast/Southeast constituency in the House of Representatives, also urged Edo people to always be vigilant. Edo Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Bello Kontongs, a Superintendent of Police (SP) confirmed the incident. He disclosed that police were on the trail of the kidnappers, vowing to get them with the victims to be released unhurt and unconditionally.
