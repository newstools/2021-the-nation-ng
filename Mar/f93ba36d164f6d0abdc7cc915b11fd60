 Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo will be expected to flag off the Science and Technology expo holding in Abuja on Monday. The expo is expected to bring together Nigerian scientists, innovators and researchers, to showcase new innovations that have occurred in the past year. Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu said this yesterday in Abuja, while touring the Eagle square, which is the venue of the exhibition. Onu who said that the Vice President will be expected to represent President Muhammadu Buhari added that the expo is not a trade fair ground where goods and services are sold but a place to showcase ideas and innovations. He added, “The essence of this expo is to find ways to commercialize innovations into products and services that the country needs and in turn provide jobs and end poverty.  “We are expected to see so many people who took innovations, developed by research institutions in the country to start up small and medium scale enterprises in the past years. Mr President wants to make sure that all those who want to work, have the best chance of doing so and this can be done through, science, technology and innovation. It is good to note that the expo is not a trade fair ground where goods are bought and sold but a place to showcase ideas to investors willing to develop such innovations.” Event planner of the expo, Mike Okokon stated that all is set to ensure that the expo is held with full adherence to all COVID-19 protocols and LED screens will be set up at strategic parts of the ground to ensure that people follow the events taking place from any part of the ground without having to converge at a place.
