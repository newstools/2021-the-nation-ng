As long as earth rotates on its axis accidents will happen. The good news is some accidents are avoidable if we know how to handle some driving challenges. How do you save yourself from an impending accident if you are unaware the vehicle in front of you has a failing brake or you are the one with a failed brake? If your brake suddenly fails, try not to panic and do the following: 1. Put on your hazard lights or sound your horn to warn other drivers. 2. A bottle or can could be obstructing your brake pedal. Use your other leg to browse through. Never take your eyes off the road while doing so. 3. Downshift to a low range labelled as one in case of automatic transmission and low gear in manual transmission. 4. Pump the brake pedal fast and hard to build brake pressure. You will know in 3-4 pumps if brakes would work. 5. Gradually apply the parking brake but be ready to release it if the car begins to skid. 6. Find an escape route, a safe exit from the highway. If you must, steer into the brushes, gravel or something soft. 7. Never target vehicles in opposite directions because accidents like these are mostly fatal. Target small trees that will help bring your vehicle to a halt with minimal effect. 8. Follow the instructions on the video below
