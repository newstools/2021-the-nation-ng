National Assembly workers on Thursday gave their management a two week ultimatum to meet their request for payment of 22 months salary arrears and other allowances or face industrial action. The workers, under the aegis of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), made this known in a letter to the Clerk to the National Assembly dated March 18, 2021. The workers threatened to shut down legislative activities in the National Assembly if their demands are not met after the ultimatum, which expires on 31st March, 2021. The letter was signed by Comrade Sunday Sabiyi, (PASAN chairman National Assembly Chapter) and Comrade Ojemeri Oisameye PASAN Chairman, National Assembly Service Commission (NASC) chapter. According to the letter, other demands include rent subsidy, hazard allowance, gratuity for retiring staff and all pending promotion arrears, among others. The workers lamented despite the intervention of the chairman of the NASC, the management had failed to convene a meeting with the union to resolve the issues in question.
