Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has blamed the worsening insecurity in the country on the attitude of the Federal Government. Wike alleged that the federal government was in the habit of politicising security matters saying unless there was change of approach security would not improve in the country. Speaking in a television programme, Wike said if the federal government had taken decisive action to tackle kidnapping when the Rivers Government appealed for assistance, the menace would not have spread to all parts of the country. He said: “I have consistently told the government of today, in as much as you politicize the issue of security you cannot get it right. Until we take the issue of security serious, not by coming on television to say we killed 200 bandits, which nobody saw.” The governor recalled that when Rivers State was faced with security crisis, most of the APC governors in the north claimed he was playing politics. On the utilisation of the 13 per cent derivation fund, the governor said no former South-South governor; particularly those that served between 2007 and 2015 could equal his achievements.
