The Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) on Wednesday said it was not in contempt of a Federal High Court order in its suits with Rite Foods Limited over the continued production and sale of its Predator Energy drink. In two suits, one of which comes up today in Lagos, both firms are locked in a battle over alleged similarities or not between the bottles and logos of their energy drinks. But in a statement on Wednesday, NBC noted “recent media coverage” relating to the matter and vowed to “vigorously contest the case”. It said: “Given that the case is now going through the due legal process, we are limited in what we can say publicly. “However, in the interest of clarity and accuracy, both NBC and Predator Energy would like to make two things 100 per cent clear: firstly, we are well within our rights to continue to sell the Predator products and secondly, neither NBC nor its Managing Director, is in breach of any court order. “Naturally, we will contest the case vigorously and after due consideration of the merits of the case, we are confident that the Court will confirm our rights based mainly on the facts that the bottles and logos are not confusingly similar and Predator Energy’s established use of the Predator brand and logo in many other markets around the world.”
