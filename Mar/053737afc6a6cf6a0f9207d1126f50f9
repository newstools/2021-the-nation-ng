One of the leaders of the Ijaw ethnic nationality, Wednesday, described a statement credited to Alhaji Asari Dokubo calling on the Niger-Delta region to join Biafra in their struggle for independence as misnomer and a political miscalculation to plunge the Niger-Delta region into a serious problem. The Ijaw leader and GMD/CEO of Babsfield Corporate Ventures and Tamfel Global Resources, Chief Julius Babogha who spoke to newsmen in Warri said there was no way Niger Delta will join Biafra to opt-out of Nigeria, adding that the region will rather stay independent than to align with Biafra. Speaking further, Babogha said, “It will be better for the region to stay on its own than to join Biafra. If you are a student of history you will understand what happened in the early 60s how the region suffered at the hands of Biafra soldiers when they took over Niger-Delta as part of the Biafra Republic. “We will be more better-being part of Nigeria nation than to align with Biafra, mostly at this contemporary time, so, l want to say that the call by Asari Dokubo on Niger-Delta to join Biafra is nothing but a suicide mission that will plunge the entire Niger-Delta states into serious political conflicts. “Asari Dokubo would have given the statement a real thought before coming out to the public because if you have seen reactions from all stakeholders across the Niger-Delta region, mostly from the Ijaw national leader, Chief Edwin Kiagbodo Clark and others, it will tell him the statement is not acceptable to all. “I want to equally advised Alhaji Asari Dokubo and his followers to go back to history and see if the path they are trying to follow is worth it, they should retrace their steps and think of how to make Nigeria a stronger nation for us all and not to divide it.”
