They spoke at the presentation of 2020 security reports to Governor Nasir El-Rufai in Kaduna. Maigwari said: “It is terrible when you see 200 to 300 bandits with weapons surrounding a village and killings people and collecting their money. Our people paid hundreds of millions of naira as ransom.” Bamali commended security forces but said:  “We still have challenges in Zaria, Giwa because after 6pm some areas become no go area. There are other dangerous places.” Traditional ruler of Zangon-Kataf, Agwatyap, Chief Dominic Yahaya, said despite occasional banditry and kidnappings in his domain, the peace committee he set up was not discouraged to ensure peace in the area. Agwa tyap, Dominic Yahaya said: “However, when perpetrators are arrested and taken to the police, we don’t know what happened afterwards. “We will continue to tread the path of peace. We will continue to work very hard to ensure that there is no reprisal”.
