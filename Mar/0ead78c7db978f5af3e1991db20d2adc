The Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Association Institutions (NASU) in schools and colleges, Akwa Ibom State branch, has protested the alleged discriminatory policy of the Federal Government to only extend the retirement age of teachers. It demanded that the Federal Government should extend the retirement age of the non-teaching workers, as they remained key component in the education sector. The Minister of Education, Malam Adamu, at the 2020 World Teachers Day Celebration at the Eagle Square, Abuja, announced incentives for teachers in public basic and secondary schools, which include extension of the retirement age of teachers to 65 years and the years of service to 40 years from the current 35 years, as well as special salary scale and enhanced allowances. The protesters marched on the state secretariat, carrying placards with inscriptions such as “What is good for the teachers is good for the non-teaching workers”, “We are as qualified as teachers, don’t deny us what belongs to us”, “Discriminatory tendencies will destroy school system”, “NASU rejects discriminatory policy”, among others. Addressing the protesters in Uyo yesterday, the state Chairman of NASU, Mr. Aniefiok Simon, said the presence of the non-teaching workers in the school environment was critical, wondering why the government should exclude them in the benefits accruing to their counterparts. He said the qualifications of their counterparts were the same with those of non-teaching workers, stressing that there was no justification to favour the teaching staff, while ignoring them. Receiving the protesters, the Board Chairman, State Basic Universal Board (SUBEB), Mr. Paul Ekpo, hailed the protesters for exercising their right peacefully. Ekpo, represented by the Board Director, Mrs. Mary Eka-ette, said SUBEB would look into their demands and its decision would be made known to them.
