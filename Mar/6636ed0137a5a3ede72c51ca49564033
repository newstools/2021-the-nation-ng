Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) Thursday advanced reasons why it will not allow the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to negotiate on its behalf in trade disputes. ASUU Chairman at the University of Ilorin (UITH) branch, Prof. Moyosore Ajao said this in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, at the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the Nigeria Union of Allied Health Professionals (NUAHP). The theme of the lecture is: Results-Oriented Unionism in a Democratic Setting. Ajao said ASUU had no apology for union leaders who wined and dined with the government. “We have peculiarities of our profession that the NLC might not fully understand. You cannot negotiate if you don’t know the peculiarities and the challenges of such an association. “We are not happy with leadership of the NLC in some of the ways and manner they have coordinated the affairs of the union. “So, ASUU, on its own, has its leadership, but we’re an affiliate of the NLC. We have never withdrawn our affiliate. We have our own leadership that deals with our own responsibilities. “Every time we meet with the government for negotiation, NLC is always represented. But they can only come in for watching brief. I cannot come and negotiate your marriage and children with you when I am not part of the marriage. But I can come as a moderator to ensure things are done normally.”
