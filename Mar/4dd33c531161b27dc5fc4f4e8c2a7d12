Monguno: On the banditry, we didn’t say we wouldn’t discuss… some respected leaders have recommended some options towards resolution But how come you couldn’t address insecurity in the country? Not that we couldn’t address the insecurity. The President had done his best in providing adequate resources and a huge amount of money but the (arms) equipment were NOT Bought and have NOT ARRIVED… Now the president has brought in new people (Service Chiefs) maybe the new people will bring in new strategies. I am not necessarily saying the immediate past service chiefs stole the money… But the money somehow went through some channels which I don’t know and many others do not know too as of NOW. Has the government investigated what happened to the (arms) money? I strongly believe the President will investigate…. As I am talking to you right now some governors under the forum have started complaining about the release of Billions for arms purchase. I must assure that strongly that the president would not take the light on issues of that magnitude that would affect the welfare of the citizens. From all indications, does it mean they have stolen money meant for arms (An ci kudin Makamai, the same phrase use to attack previous government especially referred to Dasukigate) I can’t say so now since there is no any proper investigation as of now. The only thing I can say is that the money is (Sun Salwanta) missing. The equipment weapons are yet to be seen and the new service chiefs said sincerely that they haven’t seen the equipment which they (former service chiefs) claimed they bought. Probably some of them may be coming from America, England from everywhere. BUT AT IS IT NOW on the ground, I didn’t see them and they (Service Chiefs) didn’t see them too.
