Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode has expressed displeasure over what he described as the “distasteful, tactless and provocative” nun outfit of fashion stylist and entrepreneur, Toyin Lawani. The controversial fashion stylist who shared pictures of her nun attire to the movie premiere of “The Prophetess”has been receiving bashing for the outfit. Nigerians have described her outfit as totally outrageous and belittling especially since it was meant to be a representation of the attire worn by the sacred sisters(nun) of the Catholic faith. Fani-Kayode, who joined the growing list of outraged Nigerians, tweeted “Disrespectful, tasteless, tactless, shameless, bestial, blasphemous, heretical, evil, disgusting, provocative, outrageous, anti-Christ and totally and completely unacceptable. “This is not art: it is GHETTO RUBBISH!”
