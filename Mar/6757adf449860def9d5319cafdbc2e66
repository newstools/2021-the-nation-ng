The Presidency has lamented alleged exploitation of the security crisis of the country by opposition elements to ‘blackmail’ the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, saying the government would not be distracted. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, speaking on the Channels Television daily show, Sunrise Daily on Friday, suggested that opposition elements were using insecurity to sabotage government. He assured all Nigerians the administration would remain focused on its task, adding the Buhari administration would not allow itself to be pulled down. Speaking with regards to many of the sectional agitations that had further tensed security, Shehu noted while it’s acceptable to express dissent, such expression should be done with caution. According to him: “I want to assure Nigerians that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is addressing multiple challenges that are facing the country especially in dealing with security and yet we are still making progress in agriculture, economy, anti-corruption. “It is sad for the country that opposition is exploiting some of these things. It is quite unfortunate and I want to assure that the president remains focused in preserving the security and unity of this country. “We accept that dissent is allowed, this is a democracy and people have a right to tell truth to government but we must be careful in doing that. “Nobody can bring down the government because this is a government elected democratically. “Government in a democracy comes through periodic elections and if we have a government in office as we have, sponsored by political parties to win the elections, it is telling you that that confidence of the public is still there. “People with strong ambitions, wait till four years, in fact, in our case, two more years to go to election and President Buhari will not be a candidate in that election.”
