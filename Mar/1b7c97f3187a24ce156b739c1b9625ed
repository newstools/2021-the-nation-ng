The Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has pledged a level-playing field and uninterrupted operations of all organs of the party ahead of its December national convention. The BoT Chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin, made the pledge on Thursday in Abuja while addressing reporters on the board’s resolutions at its emergency meeting on Wednesday. Jibrin, who was represented by the board’s Secretary, Senator Adolphus Wabara, explained that the board members reviewed and discussed the situation in the party nationwide. He said the emergency meeting was particularly necessary due to the political and economic tension in the country. The chairman said the meeting was meant to ensure stability of all the party’s organs and to put members on the alert and in sharp focus as the PDP prepares to retake power in 2023. “The board is fully committed not to allow any mischievous trends or strain to clog the working among between all members, particularly at the top management level of the party,” Jibrin said. The BoT chairman said the party was determined to do all that was necessary to ensure that it fulfilled the overwhelming desire of the vast majority of the people of Nigeria that the PDP regained power in 2023. According to him, the board is unequivocally committed to ensuring that normalcy and peace prevail in all the organs of the party to ensure the development and implementation of its well-structured plans. “The BoT will also ensure that very harmonious relationship exists between the organs of the party and in this regard a detailed meeting between the BoT and the NWC is being planned to be held soon,” he said. Jibrin lauded the successful conduct of the party’s three zonal congresses and expressed confidence in the current work of the party’s Reconciliation and Strategy Committee, led by former Senate President Bukola Saraki.
