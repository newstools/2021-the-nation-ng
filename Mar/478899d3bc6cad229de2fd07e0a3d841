Residents of Jakande Estate, Mile 2, Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area, Lagos, have appealed to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to save them from alleged moves by the Lagos Building Investment Corporation (LBIC) to illegally erect additional blocks of flats within the estate. In a statement jointly signed by the chairman and the secretary, Fasiu Olawale Tijani and Samuel Ajeyori respectively, the residents alleged that the LBIC in collaboration with some truck owners had already engaged a private firm to construct the garage and additional blocks of flat from the Durbar road end of the estate up to the intersection at Apapa/Oshodi/Badagry expressway. ”We know that Governor Sanwo-Olu will not be part of this illegality. Although, we have submitted our petition to his office, we are yet to get his response. We urge him not to allow anyone dent his image and the good works his government is doing in the state.”  “We want the governor to know that the area where the proposed new buildings and truck park are to be sited has wide sewage/underground stormwater canal which carries the residents’ waste to Maza-maza canal buried in it. “Other reasons for opposing the move include the fact that the axis the LBIC want to erect the buildings and the truck park is currently the location where drinking water pipe that serves the entire housing estate passed through and that building a truck park within the estate would make the residents’ lives miserable as its closeness will affect the buildings and entrances into the estate.” They equally argued that such construction would flout the 4.5-meter drainage setback stipulated by the enabling law as well as distort the master plan by Lateef Jakande, in 1981 when the estate was designed and allocated.
