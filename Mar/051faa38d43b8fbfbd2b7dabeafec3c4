The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has received about 219, 800 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines. Acting Secretary, FCTA Health and Human Services Secretariat, Dr. Mohammed Kawu disclosed this to our correspondent while speaking on the state of preparedness. Kawu further disclosed that several vaccinators have been trained, adding that the administration is just preparing to flag-off the vaccination process. His words: “The vaccine allocated to FCT is 219, 800. The vaccines are in our cold store and we do not have any issue with our level of preparedness. “We have trained our vaccinators. We are just preparing for the flag-off to start vaccination soon.” It would be recalled that the Federal Government has designated 65 centers for residents within the FCT to receive COVID-19 vaccines.

Bello, while speaking at the National Launch of COVID-19, in Abuja said that FCT had the capacity to store and distributes the vaccines, while all hands were on deck to ensure that the vaccines were well kept. He said that 65 designated centres have been prepared across the six area councils of the FCT for the first phase of the implementation. According to Bello, there are 25 vaccination centres in the Municipal council, 10 in Bwari, 10 in Gwagwalada, eight in Kuje, seven in Kwali and the remaining five in Abaji area council.
