 Following the death of Tanzania President John Pombe Magufuli, former Tanzania National Team coach Emmanuel Amuneke and his then goalkeeper trainer Emeka Amadi have sent their messages of condolences. Magufuli died  Wednesday after succumbing to heart conditions in a Dar es Salaam hospital. Amuneke was appointed head coach of the Taifa Stars in August 2018 and led the team to their first Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualification since 1980. He resigned from his position after losing all three games at the tournament held in Egypt in 2019.  “Africa has lost a great leader,” Amuneke said in a chat with NationSports “I was privileged to have met him during my time as the coach of the Tanzanian National Team. He was a great leader, May his soul rest in perfect peace and my condolences to all Tanzanians”.  Emeka Amadi, a former Flying Eagles goalkeeper trainer, also spoke glowingly about the late president, praising the 61 year-old for his fight against corruption and inequality in the nation of almost 60 million people.  “He was a good, strict president who stood for equality and fought corruption,” Amadi said. “Honest, open minded and the people respected him a lot. He brought sanity in Tanzania.”. Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan is due to take his place as the country’s head of state and will become Tanzania’s first female president.
