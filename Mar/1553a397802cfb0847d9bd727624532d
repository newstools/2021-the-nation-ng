A former National Secretary General of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas (NUPENG), Chief Frank Ovie Kokori, has said the Federal Government is at liberty to decide how it will spend the recovered £4.2 million loot linked to former Delta State Governor James Ibori. Kokori said the Federal Government’s discretion became necessary as all recovered looted funds given back to state governments over the years were either re-looted or not used for the purpose they were meant for. Addressing reporters at the weekend at his home in Ovu, Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State, the former frontline labour leader said the Federal Government could use the recovered loot for projects in Delta State as the state lacks infrastructural development. He stressed that if such funds must be released to Delta State, it should not be given directly to the state government but to be tied to projects that should be supervised directly by the Federal Government. Kokori, who accused the Delta State government of corruption, said: “It is true the Federal Government does the negotiation for all the looted funds all over the world, and if such funds should go back to the state where they were looted, they should be tied to projects in the state.”
