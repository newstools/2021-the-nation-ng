Leicester City’s  Nigeria  international  striker  Kelechi Iheanacho continued his rich vein of form as he netted his first ever  English Premier League goal  after  the Foxes hit Sheffield United for five  yesterday at the Power King Stadium. Latching  on the  yesterday’s  widely celebrated Mother’s Day , a more than happy  Iheanacho  who lost his own mother in 2013 , said he was on Cloud Nine  as he poured encomiums on ‘all mothers.’ “I don’t know how to express this, I’ve been waiting for this day to come. I’m grateful to God, my teammates and my manager for helping me grow, “ the  24-year-old told SkySports. “I wish everyone a happy Mother’s Day. I dedicate this match ball to all the mothers in the world.” The  former FIFA U-17 World Cup winner  scored the first of his three goals  when he tucked away a pass by Jamie Vardy in the 39th minute and got the second  in the 69th minute  with an assist  yet again by Vardy before completing his treble in the 78th minute. He said about playing with Vardy: “Playing with him(Vardy) is a joy, he makes so much space for me. I’m really happy, I’m delighted. Even when he’s not scoring he’s helping the team to win. “It was the first win at home for a while and it’s a clean sheet as well so we’re all really happy. “The gaffer made it clear when he came in that we need to keep going. We’re getting very near to the top, hopefully we [can] finish near there.” Meanwhile,  Leicester City’s manager Brendan Rodgers  showered praises on  the overall performance of his wards even as he commended Iheanacho for a good job well done. “Kelechi Iheanacho is a great guy and when he has been asked to come in he has performed,” noted the Scot.“ Absolutely delighted for him to have got a hat-trick in the Premier League. It’s a great achievement and all were very good team goals.”
