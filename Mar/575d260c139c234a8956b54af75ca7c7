Chairman of Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, on Tuesday said the party plans to rule Nigeria for another 32 years. He spoke while inaugurating Governor Badru Abubakar 65-man Strategy and Contact Committee of the party in Abuja. Buni said the party was set to go beyond 8th term of office. According to him: “Our vision is to provide a wheel that will drive the party to go beyond 6th, 7th and even 8th term of office to effectively implement the party manifesto, improve the lives of Nigerians and, to remain Nigeria’s leading political party. “This committee is therefore very key to our process of transition towards successful congresses and national convention and, to establish a very solid, reputable and reliable future for the party”.
