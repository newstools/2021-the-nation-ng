There is a cold war between fans of the DMW 30 BG boss, Davido and Grammy award-winning Wizkid on Twitter after the former made known his intention of having his popular coinage “E Choke” copyrighted. The coinage “E don spoil” trended on Twitter on Wednesday after videos of Wizkid and Bella Shrmuda surfaced online in what appeared to be a studio session. However, a few hours later, OBO tweeted: “Gotta have ‘e choke’ copyrighted, It’s getting outta hand.” Twitter has gone agog as there have been several innuendos and outright shading of Davido by Wizkid’s fans saying he feels threatened already since their infant coinage trended the entire day. On the other hand, Davido’s fans and a fraction of Wizkid’s fans are in full support of his intention. @emjayz wrote: “On top ordinary “E don spoil.” @horlamheday wrote: “E don spoil bro.” @Daddy_Nomso: “Copyright am because E Don Spoil.” @ay__lawrence wrote: “I am a wizkid fan but E CHOKE is bigger than anything wizkid released since 2018 honest wizkid fan.” @bright__r wrote: “Exactly OBO….Before Wizkid and his minions steal it from us.” @muhammadjamiu wrote: “E don spoil and e choke no be mate.” @bervelynnnnnn wrote: “Do it king.
