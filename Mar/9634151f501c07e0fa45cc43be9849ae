Yobe Governor Mai Mala Buni has taken his first jab of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Buni took the vaccine from his personal physician Dr. Mohammed Umar in the presence of Health Commissioner, Dr. Mohammed Gana. His deputy, Idi Barde Guban, who is chairman of the COVID-19 Task Force Committee; the SSG Baba Malam Wali; his Chief of Staff, Abdullahi Gashua; his Director General Media and all other members of the State Executive Council also took the vaccine in a ceremony at the Government House in Damaturu.  Though front-line workers in the state have started taking the vaccine about two weeks ago with more than 4,000 of them already vaccinated, Buni’s vaccination marked official flag off of the exercise since the arrival of the vaccine in the state on March 10. Buni enjoined everyone to take the vaccine and continue to maintain all COVID-19 protocols. He said: “I have just received my COVID- 19 vaccine with member of the State executive and my personal aides. “I encourage everyone to receive the vaccine. I also want to tell everyone not to forget the COVID- 19 protocols. We should continue to listen to advice from experts concerning the virus.”
