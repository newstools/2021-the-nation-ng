Victor Osimhen’s return  to action will reportedly be  determined by  Napoli’s  medical team  just as the Nigeria international  is being touted to feature against Bologna this weekend. The  player’s agent ,William D’Avila, said the  striker was  eager to repay the confidence of Napoli with a quick return to action after  suffering from  head trauma injury  in a Serie A tie away to Atalanta. “He (Osimhen) has been training in a group for three days and he is ready to play, he is very well. He is impatient to return to play and can play from the first minute against Sassuolo(today) but everything will depend on what the Napoli medical and health staff say,” D’Avila told Kiss Kiss Napoli. He continued: “He is happy with the recognition as the best player in Nigeria, but he wants to do well with Napoli, improve day after day. He wants to play the Champions League with Napoli, that’s his goal,” “He has had a bit of bad luck so far between the injury in the national team and the positivity at COVID. Clearly they weren’t particularly lucky times for him, but this time Victor has already put him behind him. “ I have spoken to him and I can assure you that he is now focused from here until the end of the season to help the team achieve their maximum. He’s in shape, he’s back in shape again in this coronavirus period after he came out of the virus. He managed to regain the perfect state of form and you will see that a couple of goals will be enough for him to get back on top,” he added. In the same vein, Italian news outlet,  Corriere del Mezzogiorno confirmed that Osimhen has been training separately and there are indications that he may feature against Bologna after checks from Napoli medical team.
