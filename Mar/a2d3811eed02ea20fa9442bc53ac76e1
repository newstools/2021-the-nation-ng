Thomas Tuchel said Chelsea need to be “more clinical” after being held by Leeds in a high-tempo goalless encounter. The Blues stretched their unbeaten run under the German to 12 games as Chelsea manager, but wasted several good chances including two for £71m forward Kai Havertz, who started in attack. Despite lacking fans to add edge to the clubs’ long-standing rivalry, both sides were unlucky not to score as they both hit the woodwork and tested their opposition keepers. Leeds almost went behind when Luke Ayling’s clearance hit team-mate Diego Llorente and looped over keeper Illan Meslier to hit the bar before Edouard Mendy tipped Tyler Roberts’ chip onto the same part of his goal.
