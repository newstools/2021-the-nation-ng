The House of Representatives has promised to recover all dividends, assets and funds belonging to the Federal government in privatised and commercialised enterprises in the country. Chairman of the House Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation, Makama Misau, spoke on Monday when the ad hoc committee set up to investigate and recover funds, assets and dividends of Federal Government in some privatised enterprises held its inaugural meeting. Misau said: “I want to assure the Speaker and members of the public that we shall work with the House Standing Rules, uphold the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in doing our job. “As Chairman of the Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation, I know, as a matter of fact, that the legal framework for privatisation and commercialisation of public enterprises is the 1999 Public Enterprises Act. “The Act established the NCP, which is chaired by the Vice-President, that makes all Privatisation and Commercialisation decisions, while the BPE, the secretariat, is responsible for implementing NCP decisions.” Misau sought the support of all stakeholders, especially former workers of privatised public enterprises, labour unions, among others. He added: “We shall x-ray the transactions processed to find any missing funds, assets, dividends of Federal Government that are not accounted for or missing and recover all on behalf of Nigerians and the Federal Government.” The chairman urged stakeholders in the assignment to work with the committee for the success of the task. He said: “I am made to understand that most of these wrongdoings were committed either through human or deliberate attempts. Therefore, the committee is going to work with caution, respect and do everything humanly possible during the exercise.”
