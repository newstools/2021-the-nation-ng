A 2019 BBNaija housemate, Natacha Akide popularly known as Tacha, has joined the league of Nigerian celebrities with at least 1 million followers on Twitter. The development follows her tweet on Wednesday afternoon, which suggested the eagerness to attain the feat. She had tweeted: “Should we tell em!!?? @jack our 1M is taking too long #TachaOurVaccine.” Four hours later, Tacha tweeted to confirm her new status on the micro-blogging platform. The announcement has led to the hashtag #Tacha1M trending at number five on Twitter. Trending alongside the hashtag are ‘TACHA FACE OF TWITTER’ and ‘TACHALLION DAY’. Following Tacha’s disqualification from the BBNaija house over the disagreement with Mercy Eke, she has become a force to reckon with on the social media space. She often than not trends on Twitter over lingering crisis with Mercy or as a result of fans who are trying to draw a comparison between the duo when it comes to achievement.
