The House of Representatives Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday grilled the management of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) Lagos, over the unauthorised spending of N1,435,772,169.00 in 2018. They were also asked to explain how items of store amounting to â‚¦925,984,845.19, said to have been purchased by staff of the Agency or supplied by various contractors through contracts, could not be traced to the stores ledger. The Agency was also queried for raising 45 payment vouchers amounting to N 109,637,912.10, without relevant supporting documents such as letter of award, delivery note, and details of the cost attached in contravention of provisions of extant laws and regulations. The queries were brought against the Agency by the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation. Deputy General Manager, Finance of the Agency, Chima Nwaobilor, who led the NAMA team, mentioned the Accountant General in the spending of the N1.4 billion. He explained that the items in the second query could not be found in the store by the team of the Auditor General because they were in their outstations.
