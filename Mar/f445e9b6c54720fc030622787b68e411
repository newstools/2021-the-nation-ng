Tottenham somehow strived to chuck away a 2-0 first-leg lead to crash out of the Europa League in the round of 16 after falling to a lame 3-0 defeat after extra time to Dinamo Zagreb. With what looked a solid lead from the first leg, Jose Mourinho named a strong side for what he hoped would result in routine progress. Zagreb’s preparations for the game were thrown into disarray when their coach was jailed for fraud. However, Mislav Orsic’s two second half goals took the tie to extra time with the hosts’ good value for the result. But the best was yet to come when, in the second half of extra-time, Orsic hit a winner of stunning quality. Picking the ball up 40 yards from goal, he ran at the Spurs defence and fired a great strike into the corner of Lloris’ net. The goal sparked crazy scenes at the Stadion Maksimir as Orsic wrote his name into Dinamo folklore. However, Arsenal confirmed their place in the Europa League quarter-finals despite losing the second leg of their Round of 16 tie with Olympiacos 1-0. Arsenal headed into the game with a 3-1 advantage from the first leg. The Greek side did get the better of the Gunners on the night, but not by a big enough margin. Arsenal progressed with a 3-2 aggregate win.
