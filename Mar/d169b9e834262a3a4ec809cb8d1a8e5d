 Popular Ibadan-based Islamic cleric Alhaji Taofeek Akewugbagold yesterday withdrew the suit he filed against the suspected abductors of his twins. The cleric made the withdrawal at the Oyo State High Court, Ringroad Ibadan. The clericâ€™s twins aged two years and four months were kidnapped at gunpoint at their residence in the Ojoo area of Ibadan on April 17, 2020. The suspects allegedly collected N4 million from the cleric before releasing the twins. Two of the kidnappers were employees of the cleric. At the resumed hearing of the suit yesterday, Akewugbagold told the court that he had forgiven the suspects and wanted the suit struck out.
