A former Jigawa Governor Sule Lamido has said Nigeria has been more divided under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the last five years. Speaking at the inauguration of Rumuji, Ibaa, Obelle Isokpo road in Emouha Local Government Area of Rivers on Monday, Lamido said APC has ‘disintegrated’ and has ‘no vision.’ “In the last five years of APC in government, Nigeria has become more divided. “There is more hate and disunity between North and South, East and West, Muslim and Christians even and ever and ever, there are bigger and micro problem “From top to bottom, it is all confusion and crisis. APC has disintegrated. There is no single job, not in the north or south. “It is our common humanity that should be uniting us,” Lamido added. Reacting to the statement, an APC chieftain, Senator Magnus Abe who spoke on Politics Today Channels Television programme monitored by The Nation, faulted the claims of Lamido. Abe said the Buhari’s administration has given freedom of speech in which the former Jigawa State governor is free to express himself. He however said that despite the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 challenges, the APC government has managed the country well and meet ‘monthly obligations’. He noted that corruption was the order of the day with the previous government, stressing that the division within the country is supported by reckless utterance of leaders across the country. He said: “He (Lamido) is not taking cognisance of the fact that this government has been able to do in so many ways what the previous government has not done.”
