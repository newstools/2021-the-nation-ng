 Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has told NationSport exclusively that the inclusion of club-less captain Ahmed Musa in the 24-man team listed for this month’s 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho was only strategic, adding the former Al Nasr striker will not be involved in the two crucial matches. Musa has been without a club since he left the Saudi Arabia side last October and his inclusion in the 24-mam list has generated huge debates across all divides moments after the list was released by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) yesterday. But speaking exclusively with NationSport, the former Bordeaux coach gave the rationale behind his long trusted captain.  “I told you before we have 23 players plus captain Musa,” Rohr explained. “That means we have 23 players who are going to play whereas Musa as part of our solidarity as a family is included so that he can train with us because we need to help him. “He is our captain and he has been missing competition and he will have the opportunity of having some serious 10 days training with the team. He will also help us too,” he added. Rohr said he was not ready to defend the choice of his players as per the vexed issue of not inviting RKC Genk forward, Paul Onuachu who has scored some 26 goals in the on-going 2020/21 Belgian Jupiler League season. “I’m not ready to defend this list but I need to see other players too; and we have called up Sadiq Umar from Spain,” he noted.
