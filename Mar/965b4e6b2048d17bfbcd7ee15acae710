Bandits have abducted 50 persons, including 27 passengers, in three commercial vehicles in various parts of Niger state on Tuesday evening. The Nation gathered the bandits blocked the highway at Kundu town, a few kilometers from Zungeru town along the Tegina-Minna Road in Niger state to carry out the operation. The three commercial vehicles were said to have nine passengers on board, all of whom were reportedly abducted with the drivers. The abductees were whisked away while the vehicles were left by the road sides. The Nation also gathered another group of bandits kidnapped an unspecified number of villagers at Gidigori town in Rafi Local Government Area. They were said to have burnt five cars and carted away valuables during the raid. A senior government official said nothing has been heard from the bandits to enable authorities know the identities of those kidnapped. In another incident, one person was killed while several others were kidnapped when bandits raided Manta town in the Shiroro local government on Monday evening. The bandits ransacked houses in the village. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun didnâ€™t respond to calls and texts by The Nation to confirm the incidents.
