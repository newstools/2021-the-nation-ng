Katsina state Governor Aminu Masari on Thursday said the attacks by bandits across schools is to draw attention of the government. Masari said bandits operating in the north are not the same as Boko Haram insurgents, but they share certain elements. He stated this during an interview on channels TV monitored by The Nation. The governor said it would be a serious problem if bandits degenerate into Boko Haram. Masari expressed fears that the bandits may resort to high profile kidnapping in cities and towns, adding that the government must “work hard” to prevent such an occurrence. He said: “The current banditry and kidnapping that is going on now are not the style of Boko Haram but some elements of Boko Haram that have been in the forest for a very long time. “There are some elements but the current banditry that is going on now is not Boko Haram yet, but if something is not done, we may end up having a much more serious problem.”
