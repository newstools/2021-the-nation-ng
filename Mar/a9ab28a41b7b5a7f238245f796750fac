Suspected cultists have set ablaze a divisional police station in Essien Udim council area of Akwa Ibom State barely a week after a police inspector was killed in the same area. The Nation gathered that many hoodlums attacked the station early yesterday and burnt it down. Vehicles and motorcycles at the facility were also set ablaze but no life was lost. Council chair Anthony Luke condemned the attack, describing it as an act of cowardice. “The council will not be intimidated in the war against criminalities in the area,” he said, dismissing insinuations that the attack was politically-motivated. Luke assured council residents that the attackers would be caught and brought to book. Police spokesman Odiko Macdon confirmed the arson attack, saying investigation had begun. Police authorities in Ebonyi State are also investigating the arson attack early yesterday on the  Iboko Divisional Police Station in Izzi council area of the state. The attackers were said to have set the building ablaze with firebombs. Police Commissioner Aliyu Garba confirmed the incident, adding that there were no casualties. “Yes they attacked the station around 1 am but there were no casualties. They threw an improvised firebomb at the station and it ignited but it only affected a small part of the building” In January three policeman were killed in an attack on Onueke Police Station in Ezza South local government area. In February, a divisional police headquarters in Isu, Onicha local government area was also burnt by hoodlums who also torched four patrol vans. The gunmen also carted away some arms and munitions at the station. Four police stations have so far been attacked in the Southeast this year.
