 Mike Tyson reckoned  Anthony Joshua won’t lay a glove on Tyson Fury in their undisputed heavyweight title fight. The biggest fight in the history of British boxing is set to take place in the summer, with a rematch tentatively slated for November or December. And former undisputed heavyweight king Tyson reckons AJ faces an almighty task to land his devastating right hand flush on the fleet-footed The Gypsy King. He told The MacLife: “You know I love f***ing Joshua. But Tyson is too elusive, he’s not gonna hit him.” Iron Mike believes Joshua’s lack of speed, not Fury’s footwork, will ultimately be his undoing against the WBC titleholder. He added: “Listen, we’re keeping it honest, right? I like Joshua. I like Joshua a lot, right? “Maybe he punches harder than.. what’s the other black guy? Wilder. He doesn’t punch faster than Wilder.  “If he doesn’t punch faster than Wilder, he’s not gonna f**ing touch this guy. That’s just what I see. “He punches hard, but he doesn’t punch fast. If Tyson Fury can get away from Wilder’s fast punches, Joshua might be in trouble.” Tyson’s prediction for the fight comes just a few days after his former coach Teddy Atlas predicted Joshua to have a ‘blackout’ in the long-awaited Battle of Britain. During a recent episode of The Fight with Teddy Atlas podcast, the 64-year-old said: “I think Fury could stop him. “I like AJ, he’s a good fighter, he’s got good talent, he’s had a great comeback. I like all that. “I’m not gonna say he has a China chin, I’m not gonna say that. But, I’m gonna say Fury has a better chin.”
