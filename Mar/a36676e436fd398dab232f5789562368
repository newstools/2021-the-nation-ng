The Nigerian Children Cultural Heritage (NCCH) will honour National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, with a stage play titled Jagaban on his 69th birthday. The all-children cast stage play is aimed at showcasing the legacies, philosophies and acts of Tinubu, who clocks 69 on Monday. It holds on Saturday at Freedom Park, Onikan Lagos by 10am and 3pm. Endorsed by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila and Lagos State Council for Arts and Culture, the play will also focus on the iconic grand patron as a unifying agent of the nation. Founder/Coordinator of NCCH, Kemi Fanimokun, said the play will be delivered in indigenous languages. She said the children will also present songs and poems aimed at celebrating “all that Asiwaju represents.”
