Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS), Abia State Police Command have reportedly arrested a gang of armed men that were allegedly responsible for the attack and killing of Point of Sales (POS) operators in the state. The Nation recalled that at least three POS operators were killed between January and February in Aba while several outlets were attacked and disposed of cash worth several amounts of money. The Police Public Relations Officer, Abia State Command, Geoffrey Ogbonna could not be reached for comments on the matter at the time of filing the report, but sources within the police circle told our correspondent that the arrest of the suspects was through coordinated efforts of RRS operatives. Similarly, a gang of armed men that arrived Aba in a Hummer bus at the weekend has been arrested. Police sources told our correspondent that the gunmen arrived at Aba, the commercial nerve of the state in a hummer bus from a neighbouring state with the intention of carrying out their nefarious act. The arrival of the gang was said to have sent jitters to the residents who purportedly started panicking. The Nation learnt that the RRS operatives, learning about the arrival of the gang in Aba, swung into action, leading to the arrest of the gang in their hideout on Friday night through a coordinated operation based on intelligence reports.
