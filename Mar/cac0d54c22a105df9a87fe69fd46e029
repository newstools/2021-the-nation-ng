 A Federal High Court in Lagos has struck out a N148.3 million fraud charge filed by the Economic Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) against six men and a firm. Justice Maureen Onyetenu dismissed the charge, marked FHC/L/354C/2018, for want of diligent prosecution. The men and the firm are: Alimi Haruna, Momouda Mohammed, Shittu Muideen, Akpojaro Amos, Jogo Yusuf, Duru Patrick and Ashina Oil & Gas Ltd. The EFCC arraigned the defendants on October 30, 2018 on a charge of conspiracy, money laundering and unlawfully retaining proceeds of illicit act, among others. But the EFCC failed to show up after several adjournments. Its last appearance in court was on November 6, 2018. Last February 16, the judge had had enough. Justice Onyetenu held: “Upon this charge coming up before this court on 16th day of February, 2021 for hearing, and the court having heard… the application to strike out this charge for want of diligent prosecution. And this court having gone through the records, the prosecuting counsel having not been appearing since 13th day of November, 2018, this case is hereby struck out and the defendants are discharged, though not on merit.”
