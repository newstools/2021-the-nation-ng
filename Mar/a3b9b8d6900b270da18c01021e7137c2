Super Eagles full-back Ola Aina had a solid game as Fulham picked up a big 1-0 victory at Liverpool yesterday. The 24 year-old former Chelsea star was at his best defensively as he kept Liverpool’s Egyptian talisman Mohammed Salah at bay and helped relegation threatened cottagers inflict a sixth consecutive home defeat on the English champions. Fellow Super Eagles international Josh Maja and Nigeria-born duo of Tosin Adarabioyo and Ademola Lookman were also involved in the surprise win. Also in England, Kelechi Iheanacho scored for the second straight game as Leicester came from behind to beat Brighton 2-1 at the AMEX Stadium on Saturday. Midfield powerhouse Wilfred Ndidi also played 90 mins and put in a good display. Meanwhile, Simy Nwankwo bagged a brace for Crotone in a 4-2 win against Torino and helped them to their first win in nine games yesterday in Italy’s Serie A. The 28 year-old scored in the 27th minute from the penalty spot to put Crotone 1-0 ahead and in the 54th minute he got his second goal to put his side 2-1 ahead before coming off on 75 minutes. Nwankwo has now scored an impressive 10 league goals in 26 appearances for Serie A’s bottom team Crotone who had lost their last eight games. Goalkeeper Maduka Okoye was impressive yet unlucky, as a 96th min pen resigned Sparta Rotterdam to a 1-1 draw at FC Emmen while Tyronne Ebuehi and FC Twente were held to a 1-1 league draw at home to Willem II.
