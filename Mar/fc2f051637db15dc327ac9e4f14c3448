The FCT Football Association chairman Adam Mouktar Mohammed has enrolled for a coaching course at the National Institute for Sports (NIS) in Abuja just as he has awarded full scholarships to at least 16 others. The aspiring coaches are drawn from all the FCT area councils as well as various stakeholdersâ€™ platforms. The beneficiaries include former Golden Eaglets star Elie Ayuba, Nkiruka Timothy, Nkechi Joy Ogboh and Abubakar Nuhu. It will be recalled that the FCT FA under the leadership of Mouktar Mohammed also sponsored 21 persons for another coaching course at the NIS last year as part of their capacity-building programme.
