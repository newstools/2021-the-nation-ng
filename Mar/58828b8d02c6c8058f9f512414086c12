Two policemen have been shot dead in Cross River State as attacks on checkpoints mount. Last week four policemen were gunned down on the outskirts of Calabar, the state capital. The slain men’s rifles were taken away. On Tuesday night gunmen attacked two checkpoints in the Obubra area of the state, killing two policemen and taking away their guns. Local sources said six policemen and a soldier were killed. But police spokesperson Irene Ugbo said two of their men were gunned down, while a soldier was injured. She said police were after the attackers. The Nation gathered that it was soldiers who repelled the gunmen, forcing them to abandon their bus and flee into the bushes. “One Army man who was seriously injured is believed to have died,” a source said.
