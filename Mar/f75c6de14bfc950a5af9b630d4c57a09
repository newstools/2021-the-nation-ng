Suspected Boko Haram insurgents on Tuesday burnt a military base in Katarko village near Damaturu, the Yobe State capital during an attack. Some residents disclosed the insurgents also set ablaze the Katarko Primary School and the healthcare clinic in the village after they were alleged to have looted drugs and food items from the facilities. Adamu Ali, who lives close to the primary school, the healthcare facility and the military base, a triangular area of the operation told THE NATION his family was awaken by gunshots and petrol bombs. He added the insurgents came to the village around 5.30am during Muslim prayers. “It was such a very terrible way of waking up. The gunshots and the fire from the petrol bombs were scary but thank God we stayed in the house and we were not attacked except for the burning of the military base, the primary school and the clinic,” Adamu informed. Katarko is about 25km east of Damaturu, the Yobe State capital. The police and military authorities have not issued any official statement on the attack. Army spokesman, Sector 2 Operation Lafiya Dole, Lt. Kennedy Anyanwu, did not respond to enquiries by THE NATION.
