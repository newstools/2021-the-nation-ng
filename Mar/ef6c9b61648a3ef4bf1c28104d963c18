The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved N190.5 million for a research microscope at the premier university, the University of Ibadan (UI), in Oyo State. Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, announced this to State House Correspondents at the end of yesterday’s weekly cabinet meeting chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari. Nwajiuba said it became necessary to acquire such equipment because the only one being used by the famous institution had become obsolete. Also, the FEC yesterday approved the construction of three power sub-stations in Kano and Benue states. Power Minister Mamman Saleh announced this while addressing State House correspondents at the end of the week’s FEC meeting. The minister said the Council also approved the extension of transmission lines in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, and Mbano, in Imo State. He said the new sub-sections would expand the national grid for sustainable supply of electricity and improve capacity. Saleh said the extension of transmission lines in Abia and Imo states will cost $506,324.40 plus N34,034,000 local content. On the amount for the construction of three sub-stations in Zaki-Biam, Benue State, as well as Bichi and Kanyi in Kano State, the minister said the one in Zaki-Biam is $8.6 million while the local content is N2.08 billion. The second one in Bichi is $9.6 million, plus N1.7 billion local content. According to him, the one at Kanyi in Kano State is $9.5 million, plus N1.7 billion. Asked if there was any problem that made the government to embark on new projects, Saleh said: “There has not been any problem so far. But we just have to expand the national grid for sustainable supply of electricity and to improve capacity. That is all.”
