The Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), Oyo State chapter, has told the former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, to produce to the whole world, the real Fulani warlord terrorising the people of Ayete, Igangan and Ibarapa areas of Oyo State. The chapter through the Chairman, Mr. Rotimi Oguntade, popularly called Olumo, said the claims of the former minister that the person arrested by the men of the OPC was not the Iskilu Wakilin was not only untrue, but also misleading. He described Fani-Kayode as a spoiler, an agent of destruction and a political feather weight reputed for changing the narratives and misinforming the public. Olumo said: “Fani-Kayode’s utterances merited no response, but because it came at a time the chief tormentor of Ibarapa people is still in custody, it is reasonable to respond and clear the air on the issue.”
