A political pressure group, the Coalition of All Nigerian Support Groups, has drummed up support for a president of Southeast extraction. The group, drawn from states across the federation, urged the convener of the New Nigeria Group, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, to run for president in 2023. Speaking during a solidarity visit to Ohuabunwa in his Arochukwu Local Government country home, the group Chairman, Mr. Ifeanyi Mark, said Nigeria was founded on regional structure and the structure had remained the basis for sharing political offices since independence in 1960. He said the Southeast has been denied the opportunity to produce a president, adding that other zones have taken their turns. Mark said the only way to ensure justice and equity was to allow someone from the zone to be the president. He said Ohuabunwa is the man for the job owing to his wealth of experience, integrity and meritorious track record, noting that he will salvage the country from economic quagmire. Mazi Ohuabunwa assured the group that he would heed its advice. He said the call was divine, as he heard from God that his services were needed to reposition the country. Ohuabunwa, who identified four challenges facing Nigeria to include poverty, corruption, injustice and insecurity, said the approach to solve them include tackling poverty, which would largely solve corruption, while solving the injustice challenge would deal with insecurity.
