Katsina State Governor Aminu Masari on Thursday called for the rotation of the presidency in 2023. He said the Southern region of the country should produce the next President. Masari spoke during an interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today, monitored by The Nation. He said that a non-northerner should succeed President Buhari in 2023 in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice. His position trailed the views of some All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftains who have maintained that there is an agreement on zoning. Recently, former Senate Leader Ali Ndume also threw his weight behind presidential rotation, saying that the retention of the presidency in the North in 2023 would amount to a third term. Masari said: “If you ask me as a person, Aminu, I think we should move the presidency to the southern part of the country.” Although he did not specify which particular geographical region of the South should produce the next President, the governor maintained that “South is South.” Masari expressed optimism that the ruling party will fare well after President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure, despite the challenges currently facing the country. He said no political party has brought social interventions for the betterment of the masses in Nigeria’s history like the APC. He added: “Let everybody come with a balance sheet of what they got yesterday and what we get today and compare notes.”
