Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has lamented his side’s offensive impotence following their 1-0 loss to Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday. The defeat, which leaves their hopes of finishing in the top four hanging in the balance, was their sixth in succession at home in the Premier League. Never before their present run had they lost more than four-consecutive top-flight games. Klopp, whose defence has been decimated by injury this season, seems to have point the finger at his forward line. “There were moments we could have had more of an impact on the game. Conceding that goal before half-time was a massive blow. “We tried to react and the boys showed that. In the end we don’t score goals and that’s a big problem,” Klopp told Sky Sports “Fulham will cause us problems – it’s clear. They’re in a good moment, they’re a good team. We all agree a team like this should stay in the Premier League. “[On suggestions Fulham players wanted it more] The winner is always right. My boys wanted it. It’s easy to judge they have won it so wanted it more. I don’t think that’s the problem. “I don’t have to stand here and say we’re fighting for this or that.” Goal
