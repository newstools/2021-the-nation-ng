The National Camp for the forthcoming Tokyo Olympics Games will be set in Edo State to allow contingents for the games to take advantage of the world-class Samuel Ogbemudia stadium, Benin City and other facilities built by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration, for their preparations. Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, disclosed this to journalists during a visit to Edo State ahead of the National Sports Festival, scheduled to take place in the state between April 2 and 14. Dare who expressed satisfaction with the quality and standard of sporting facilities in the state, noted that the revamp of Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium and other facilities has raised the bar for sports development for other states in Nigeria. He stated that Edo was the best place to host contingents for the Olympic Games, adding: “There is no better place to host Nigerian athletes for the Tokyo Olympic Games than Edo State. The state already has the facilities and the national camp will be set up in Edo State.” On his part, Governor Obaseki noted: “From what we have seen here, it is clear that this is a world-class facility that is ready to host a world class event. Every sport listed in the festival has world-class facilities to cater for it. The facilities match whatever you have across the globe. We are ready. Accommodation is ready.”
