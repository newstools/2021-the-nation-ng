Holidaymakers and visitors to the La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resort, Lagos will get 20 per cent discount if they use Sterling Bank debit cards. Founder, La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resorts, Otunba Olawanle Akinboboye, said the discount would encourage holiday makers. It will subsidise the resort’s clients who savour its beach, lagoon and mangrove forest, tropical flora, fauna, kingfishers, seahawks, egrets, and ducks, he added. According to Akinboboye, the incentive became necessary to stimulate domestic tourism. He said some countries were subsidising holidaymakers to revive tourism by backing hotels through intervention funds to offer discounts, free nights, and car hire. Divisional Head, Retail and Consumer Banking, Sterling Bank, Mr. Shina Atilola: “We introduced the discount initiative post-COVID-19 lockdown to stimulate the domestic tourism sector. Nations across the world are taking definitive steps to revive the sector. For instance, the Japanese government offered up to $184 in subsidies and free vouchers per day to revive its domestic tourism sector. This partnership with La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resorts seeks to achieve the same purpose.’’
