 It’s a known fact that Gumsu Sanni-Abacha walked out of her 20-year-old marriage to Cameroonian multi-billionaire Bayero Fadil years ago over irreconcilable differences. However, Gumsu seems to have found out what it means to be loved again after her secret nuptials to Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, which occurred a few weeks ago at her late father’s residence in Abuja. The highly cerebral second daughter of the former head of state General Sanni Abacha is currently in a gay mood despite tongues wagging that her marriage to Buni is politically motivated. It is believed in some quarters that Buni’s popularity the APC caretaker Chairman might have been responsible for Gumsu’s acceptance of his hand in marriage. Nonetheless, Gumsu has continued to disassociate herself from politics most especially when rumor had it that she is seeking an elective post at the Nigerian Senate to represent her constituency.  “Gumsu just wants to be loved and pampered. She wants a man who would complete and compliment her. All the above features she dreams of a man were seen in Governor Buni, hence, the reason she didn’t care about the public outcry of her acceptance to be the governor’s fourth wife. All she wanted is happiness, love, and peace of mind. Her children also agreed and approved of the union.” a family source disclosed. Another Source further averred that; Gumsu has changed lately. She is more lively, happy, and cheerful. She seems to be enjoying her current nuptial status. “Fatima is a happy woman, she is enjoying her new relationship. People should learn to respect other people’s decisions. She is happy with her union. Lately, she often flaunts her expensive wedding ring at every given opportunity with a smile on her face. For her, it feels good to wear that wedding ring once again. Most especially, when you are in love with your partner,” the family source divulged.
