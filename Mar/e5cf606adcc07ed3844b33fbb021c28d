Women Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State Jumoke Okoya-Thomas has advocated better opportunities for women in governance, business and the corporate world as the world marks International Women’s Day. Okoya-Thomas, in a statement she signed, said the theme of this year’s edition ‘Women in Leadership: Achieving an Equal Future in a COVID-19 World’, is timely since women are the most affected by the pandemic as they serve as the central point in their families. She urged states and the Federal Government, as well as corporate organisations to provide more opportunities for women to thrive as the world braces up to cope with challenges of the pandemic. The statement reads: “Many women lost their husbands, while some lost their children to the virus. Many also lost their means of livelihoods during the pandemic. It is therefore imperative that the various institutions provide a safety net for women during this trying period in our history. “We all know that life is no longer the same for most families, and many women have had to cope with the challenges of becoming breadwinners. COVID-19 did not discriminate against any sex so the world should start giving women equal opportunities with their male counterparts.” The party chieftain stressed that the best way to restore normalcy in the system is to allow women to serve in leadership positions. She also advised women to see themselves as equal to the task and brace up for such opportunities when they come along. She also promised to continue to work with people of like minds to ensure that Nigerian women are given their rightful position in society.
