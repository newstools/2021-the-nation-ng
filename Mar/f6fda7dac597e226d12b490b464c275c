The pump price of the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), according to the  Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) in its March template, is N212.6 per litre. This is an indication of a subsidy of N50.61 per litre since the only importer of the product- the Pipelines Products Marketing Company (PPMC) has not notified marketers on upward review of the pump price. The PPPRA has said in a deregulated market, it is only the marketers that peg their product price. But the Federal Government has insisted through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) that there will be no petrol price hike in March. According to the template, expected ex-depot price is N206.42 while the landing cost is N189.61 for the month of March, 2021. Meanwhile, The Nation learnt from the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) on Friday morning that the government was yet to notify them on any price hike via their usual memo. Speaking with The Nation on phone, the IPMAN National Vice President Alhaji Abubakar Maigandi, said: “I was in a NEC meeting with the NNPC and state Governor’s yesterday (Thursday) they only complained of the soaring prices of crude oil. They have not asked us to increase pump price”.
