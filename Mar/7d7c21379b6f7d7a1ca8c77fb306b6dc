Brazilian football legend Pele hailed an “unforgettable” day after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine and urged people not to let down their guard against the deadly virus. Pele, 80, widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, posted a picture of himself on Instagram with the accompanying message: “Today was an unforgettable day. I received the vaccine!” The photo shows the former Santos and New York Cosmos striker wearing a mask and giving a thumbs-up while he received his shot. He did not say which vaccine he had received or whether it was his first or second dose. The message from one of Brazil’s greatest sons comes the same day that a record 1,641 people were reported to have died in the South American nation after contracting the virus. “The pandemic is not over. We must remain disciplined to save lives because many people have not yet been vaccinated,” he wrote, and advocated mask-wearing, social distancing and hand-washing as virus protection. “This will pass if we think of each other and help each other,” he added. The only player to win three World Cups – in Sweden in 1958, Chile in 1962 and Mexico in 1970 – Pele has self-isolated at his house in Sao Paulo since the start of the health crisis which has left more than 255,000 people dead in Brazil, where vaccination has been slow to start. As an octogenarian, Pele forms part of the population considered at high risk of coronavirus complications.
