Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has directed head teachers of public secondary schools to begin refund of the money paid by SS3 pupils for this year’s West African Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSSCE). He said he has approved N360million for the payment of 2020/2021 WASSSCE fees for SS3 pupils in public schools across the state, in line with his administration’s free education policy. The governor spoke through the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Mrs. Lola Amuda, at a meeting with the executives of the All Nigeria Conference of Principals of Secondary Schools (ANCOPSS) and other stakeholders in the education sector. He urged school administrators to reciprocate his nice gesture by ensuring that the pupils perform excellently in the exam. The governor also directed the school heads to furnish the ministry with the names of all SS3 pupils, to avoid paying for those that have gone to enrol elsewhere. ANCOPPS President in Ondo State Mr. Johnbull Ajinde Mebawondu said the school heads would abide by the government policy.
