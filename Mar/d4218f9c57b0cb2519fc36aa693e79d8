Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has warned some leaders within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ganging up ahead of the 2023 general elections. Wike, according to a statement by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, spoke at the weekend during the PDP campaign inauguration for the April 17 Local Government election at the Isaac Boro Park, Port Harcourt. The statement said: “Meanwhile, the governor has warned those within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who want to gang up against Rivers State to be circumspect, as no other State has given more votes to the PDP since 1999 than Rivers. “The governor stated that some persons within the PDP were conspiring against Rivers State and warned them to desist because the State has the capacity to ruffle the party having delivered the highest number of vote for her in all the general elections since 1999”. The governor also advised the PDP chairmanship candidates that if elected into office they must remain in their respective council headquarters to govern. He warned the state government would not tolerate a situation where council chairmen would spend more of their time in Port Harcourt, the State capital. He said: “Remain in your local government, leave Port Harcourt alone. If you are chairman of Gokana, remain in Gokana. If you are chairman of Khana, stay in Khana. If you are Akuku Toru chairman, stay in Abonnema. “It is not going to be business as usual, if God has given you the opportunity, why don’t you stay with your people. I will make sure you remain in your local government, if you don’t do anything, I will embarrass you.”
