Former governor of Ogun State Otunba Gbenga Daniel on Friday had a meeting with the Chairman, Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Gov. Mai Mala Buni to further exploit grounds to attract more members from the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Daniel who was until last month a member of PDP and former Director General of the Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign Organization decamped to the ruling APC. The meeting which took place in the private residence of the APC Caretaker Committee Chairman in Wuse, Abuja lasted for about an hour. The governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Abubakar Badru was also in attendance at the meeting. Though none of the leaders spoke to the Press after the meeting, a source closed to the APC Chairman said that the meeting was to strategize on how to attract more opposition chieftains who have indicated interests to join the APC before the party’s national convention. “You remember he (Daniel) was the Director General of the Atiku Abubakar Presidential campaign organization in 2019. He has vital role to play in ensuring the defection of some PDP leaders who have shown interest in crossing over to APC. “The Daniel defection was an added political fortune for APC, not only in the South West but in the country. Today’s meeting is to further consolidate and plan how to attract more members of the opposition to APC. “You know Daniel is a grassroots politician with large followership that would improve the fortunes of APC,” our source predicted. In recent times top notch members to the opposition that joined the ruling party include former Speaker of House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, Gov. Dave Umahi of Eboyin, Sen. Elisha Abbo, Sen. Isa Haman Misau, Otunba Iyiola Omisore, former Adamawa State Governor, James Bala Ngilari, Hon. Datti Yako from Kano State and others.
