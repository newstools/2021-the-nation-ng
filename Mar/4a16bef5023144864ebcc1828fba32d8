 A group, ‘Fix Politics,’ has called for the amendment of the constitution and the Electoral Act to permit Diaspora voting. Its director, Anthony Ubani, said the population of Nigerians abroad, which account to huge capital inflow and investment, cannot be politically ignored. He said the group will continue to pursue constitutional, political and electoral reforms that will promote inclusion and boost popular participation. Ubani told reporters in Lagos that political apathy was wrong, stressing that many African  countries were lagging behind because of the quality of their politics. He said: “Politics in any society determines the level of development; human, economic, technological.” Ubani said ‘Fix Politics’ will always engage and empower the citizenry so they could understand their rights, duties and responsibilities. He said Nigerians should be able to cast informed votes and refuse to exchange their votes for money and loaves of bread. The director also called for proper education and enlightenment of the people, noting that educated people are bound to ask questions, interrogate issues and insist on their rights. Ubani called for a value-based leadership, wondering why people who pay more  attention to the persons they employ as their shop attendants than persons they vote into positions of responsibility. He added: “Leaders should be ethically inclined, and they must have respect for citizens, and not promoters of stomach infrastructure, chop-I-chop,  bread and butter politicians. Leadership should be about service.” Reflecting on the security situation in the country,  Ubani said:” Since policing is underfunded, national security will be in jeopardy. The budget is not enough to train and equip the police.”
