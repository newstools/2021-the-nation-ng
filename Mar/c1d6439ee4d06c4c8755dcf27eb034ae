The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s routine overseas medical checkups as a badge of failure and direct indictment of the Presidency for failing to fix the healthcare system, which the party said has been wrecked by the administration. In a statement on Tuesday by spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said it’s indeed worrisome that under Buhari, even the hitherto highly rated State House Clinic, has become so moribund it cannot provide a simple medical checkup service for the President. The party said while it holds nothing against where any person, including President Buhari seeks their medical services, it was however worried the Buhari Presidency is taking no decisive steps to fix health care system, ostensibly because the President can afford overseas medical treatment at tax payers’ expense. The statement said: “The PDP is disturbed that while Mr. President jets out for medical treatment in well-equipped hospitals abroad, our hospitals and medical personnel are in very sorry situation, while millions of our compatriots suffer, with many dying on a daily basis from conditions that have simple medical solutions. “It is indeed heartrending that Nigerians are suffering this huge misfortune of having this highly insensitive, incompetent and corrupt leadership of very selfish individuals who do not care about the welfare of other citizens. “More saddening is that all the institutions, policies and programmes established by the PDP, which hitherto ensured access to affordable healthcare for Nigerians have been wrecked by the Buhari administration”.
