Nigeria’s first recipient of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, Cyprian Ngong, believed he might not have lost his father if the country had the vaccine. The frontline doctor at the National Hospital, Abuja received the first shot of the vaccine administered by CEO of National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib. Speaking shortly after getting the vaccine, the doctor said he lost his father months ago to COVID-19, and that he might still be alive, if he had got a jab. “I only wish my dad had had that vaccine, maybe, months ago or so. We lost him and the fight is still on and we will win,” he said. When asked about how he felt after receiving the vaccine, he said: “You can see I just took the vaccine now and I feel good. I have dreamt of taking this vaccine and I have taken the vaccine. Thank you very much.” Ngong commended the National Hospital in the fight against COVID-19, saying the pandemic affected them in certain areas but they are happy that doses of the vaccine are now available.
