A consortium of four leading international organisations with proven track records, namely FrieslandCampina WAMCO, URUS, Barenbrug and Agrifirm, on Monday announced their co-operation as strategic partners to accelerate the Nigerian dairy sector. The formation of this unique consortium, specialized in milk collection and processing (FrieslandCampina WAMCO), breeding (URUS), roughage production (Barenbrug) and animal feed (Agrifirm), will help to bolster a sustainable and integrated dairy sector model. The model will formulate homegrown methods and solutions to challenges, which previously needed external intervention. It will plan and act on the long-term requirements for a self-sufficient dairy
chain in the country. The partners are expected to endorse this ambitious plan by signing the cooperation agreement at a webinar scheduled to hold on Tuesday, April 20, 2021, where key representatives of each partner will also share their vision on how to accelerate dairy development in Nigeria. A statement signed by Executive Director, Corporate Affairs, FrieslandCampina WAMCO, Ore Famurewa, quoted the company’s Managing Director, Ben Langat, as saying: “In FrieslandCampina WAMCO, our ambition is to jointly invest in local business models to enable the dairy sector to become self-sufficient and profitable throughout the entire chain. “This will include building joint infrastructure, collaborative training of farmers, investing in local production and leveraging each other’s knowledge and competencies.” Global Director, Dairy Development and Milkstreams, FrieslandCampina, Jeroen Elfers, also affirmed that “Only a sector with a return on investment in every part of the chain can be self-sufficient and will survive in the long term”. Elfers said: “We are proud to state that these three professional and world-leading companies with proven track records share this ambition and believe in developing the cornerstones of the Nigerian dairy sector with FrieslandCampina WAMCO.”
