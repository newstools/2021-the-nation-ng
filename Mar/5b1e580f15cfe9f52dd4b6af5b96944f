Grammys winner, Burna Boy, is confident his kids will be proud of his achievements as a music star. Barely six days after winning the Grammys for his fifth studio album, Twice As Tall, in the Best Global Music Album, Burna Boy says his kids will confidently tell the world that he did it on his own. “My kids will confidently beat their chest and say Daddy did it on his own, We can do it on our own,” he said. Continuing, Burna Boy said: “When you know yourself. nobody can tell you about yourself. know yourselves and never go against yourself.” “God is most definitely not a man. I will never forget how so many of you prayed that I don’t win. Face with tears of joy, Rolling on the floor laughing too dumb to understand that you also win if I win. No worry This is just the beginning. God is Great.” Acknowledging the support from his fans and team, he said: “God bless everyone/ anyone who has stood with me! Let’s keep making history! Every single person that worked on the project, my incredible team that works 24/7, and my outsiders! Big love always.”
