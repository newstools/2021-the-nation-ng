No fewer than 10 people were killed on Saturday in a motor accident in Azare, Katagum Local Government Area of Bauchi State. Twelve other people were seriously injured. The Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Bauchi State, Mr Yusuf Abdullahi, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Bauchi that the accident occurred when a motorcycle conveying four passengers rammed into an oncoming Toyota Hiace hummer bus, belonging to Gombe Line Express. Time was about 2.30pm. Abdullahi said all the passengers on the motorcycle lost their lives instantly while six passengers in the bus also died. All the corpses were deposited in the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Azare while the injured were taken to New Jama’are Clinic in Azare for treatment. “Out of the 12 people that were injured, we have six male adults, three female adults, one male child and two female children,” he said. He attributed the accident to over speeding and called on all commercial fleet operators to install Speed Limiting Device (SLD) in their vehicles. “This is because any time the driver decides to behave anyhow or go beyond normal speed, the device would curtail it. “They should endeavour to install the device to curtail drivers’ excesses,” he advised. He reiterated that the corps would continue to carry out public enlightenment campaigns in motor parks, market squares and roads on the causes and dangers of road accidents.
