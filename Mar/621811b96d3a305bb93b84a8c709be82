SIR: As one of the thousands of applicants for the 2020 Nigeria Immigration Service recruitment, I wish to bring to your notice the needless delays that have attended this particular exercise since March 2020. It is on record that the secretary to the board of interior – Alhassan Yakmut, through his press release in December 2020, that is, shortly after the Computer-Based Aptitude Test, CBAT, promised that the outcome would be out before December 15, 2020. That statement did not come to pass. On February 13, the Comptroller General Of Immigration – Muhammed Babandede also gave an update on the recruitment wherein he said “We shortlisted 6,000 candidates for final screening and only those that are fit and qualified will be recruited as officers of the service in the next two weeks”. The two weeks is going to a month now without any information. We are naturally concerned over the delay hence our appeal to those in charge (The Ministry of Interior Board, the Nigeria Immigration Service and Nigeria Civil Defense and Security Corps), to expedite action to save us from further agonies. I use this medium to appreciate the Minister of Interior – Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola for the changes brought into the recruitment process, particularly for changing the old method of manual examination to CBAT. I strongly believe that this would ensure transparency and increase the chances of the “children of the poor” in getting the job. Again, on behalf of the over 100,000 applicants who sat for the Nigeria Immigration Services, NIS and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC exam on 7th and 8th December 2020 respectively, I plead with concerned agencies to please do the needful by bringing the long awaited result out.
