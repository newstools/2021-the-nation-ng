Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole on Thursday paid a courtesy call on Ogun Governor Dapo Abiodun. The meeting, which started as soon as the former federal two-term lawmaker arrived at the Oke-Mosan Secretariat around 4:12 pm, went into a closed-door meeting that lasted about two hours. Also at the meeting was the Senior Special Adviser to the Governor on Political Matters, Hon. Tunji Egbetokun. Though the agenda of the meeting was not declared, it was gathered it may not be unconnected with Abiodun’s move to strengthen his political base in Ogun Central Senatorial District ahead of the forthcoming council poll and 2023 general elections. When asked what was discussed, Bankole told reporters: “Yes, I was in the building. I met with the Governor. You would soon found out,” he said. When asked of his impression of the Government of Dapo Abiodun, he quipped: “So far, so good”, adding that his meetings with both the President had “good outcomes”. The former Speaker defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) last week.
