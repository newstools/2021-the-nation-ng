Osun State Health Commissioner Dr. Rafiu Isamotu has said the state is still waiting for the result of samples taken from three people who died on Sunday and Monday. The Nation reports that three people died, while three others were hospitalised over the suspected outbreak of cholera at the Oke-Gada area of Ede North Local Government. Isamotu, speaking with reporters on Wednesday, said the outcome of the laboratory analysis is still being expected, adding that the symptoms presented by the three dead victims clinically look like cholera. He said: “We have taken the samples to the laboratory and are still awaiting results before we can boldly say it is cholera. The laboratory diagnosis must confirm our suspicions first. Only three casualties have been recorded so far, with one death on Sunday evening and two on Monday. “They were admitted at a health facility in Ede. Six persons have been discharged from the hospital, while we have hope of discharging the remaining three today.”
