The Police Command in Benue has arrested one suspect in connection with the gruesome killing of Mrs Eunice Aganya, wife of retired Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Ibezimako Aganya, spokesperson Catherine Anene said in a statement in Makurdi on Sunday. Mr Aghanya was a Commissioner of Police in the state. Police on Saturday confirmed the killing of his wife in her Makurdi residence. Anene said Commissioner of Police Audu Madaki ordered a full-scale investigation into the killing by the command’s Criminal Investigation Department. Anene said her body had been deposited at Bishop Murray Hospital Morgue, Makurdi. Mrs Aganya was the owner of Euniland Bakery. The ex-DIG told The Nation that thieves killed his wife after recognising her and fearing she might expose them. “My daughter called her; the phone rang but she did not pick so I joked with my daughter, saying, “Don’t mind Mummy, it is because she promised and failed to give you what she promised. That’s why she is not picking the call. “I again called but she did not pick so I suspected something was wrong. I suspected kidnappers so I sent a text message to her phone, saying, If you are kidnapped tell them to call me I’m ready to pay ransom, I will not report to police”.
