Anthony Joshua is training for “a whole host of techniques and tactics” that Tyson Fury may use, revealed trainer Joby Clayton. Joshua and Fury have signed a two-fight contract to decide an undisputed heavyweight champion this year, in what will be the biggest fight of a generation. “It’s never too early to talk about basic game-plans. We are laying the foundations in preparation for camp,” said Clayton, who works alongside Joshua’s head trainer Rob McCracken, to Sky Sports. “My job is to prepare AJ to his best ability. I know that when AJ is AJ, he’s a handful for anybody. The most important thing is that he focuses on himself. “Fury is a very versatile athlete so I am personally focusing on AJ, and what he brings to the table to combat a whole host of techniques and tactics that he might face. AJ is doing some wonderful work, training with a wonderful energy. This is a special time in his career. I’m excited to see what the next few months hold. “I have a saying; coaches have to get boxers to train, but they have to get champions to rest. We have to make sure AJ rests at the appropriate times because he is so dedicated.” Fury’s two reigns as world heavyweight champion came after starkly different performances – he out-skilled Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 then battered Deontay Wilder last year. Fury has also worked with a host of different trainers from Peter Fury to Ben Davison and now Sugarhill Steward. Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn previously told Sky Sports: “All parties have now put pen to paper and we will be working hard over the next few weeks to confirm the site and date for the biggest fight in boxing.”
