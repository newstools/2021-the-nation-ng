Parents of the abducted 39 students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation Afaka, Kaduna on Friday met with government and security stakeholders behind closed doors. The Kaduna State Government called the meeting apparently to find ways of securing release of the students. The meeting, which held behind closed doors at the Government House in Kaduna, lasted for hours. Although outcome of the meeting was not made public, it was gathered the interaction was basically to let the parents know the government feels their pains and will do its best for the safe release of the students. The parents had alleged the government was not doing enough to secure release of their children and issued a 48-hour for their rescue. They urged Governor Nasir El-Rufai to negotiate with the bandits to secure the safe release of their children. The bandits, who had released a video of the abducted students being tortured barely 24 hours after their abduction, demanded N500 million ransom for their release.
