Social media users have reacted to viral pictures of Davido kissing American Instagram model, Mya Yafai, at a party in the US. While simple people said the singer’s act is a total disrespect for his fiancée, others argued the pictures are probably from a movie scene and so on. @Tife_fabunmi tweeted: “Davido can never cheat on Chioma, those pictures are definitely from a movie scene, y’all don’t forget Davido is not only an artiste, he’s an actor too. I can’t wait for the movie to drop, definitely going to be a blockbuster.” @vinz6199 said: “Davido and Chioma are still together, the pictures flying around are from a scene In his upcoming video. It’s just the continuation of when he was holding her hands that time, trying to cross the road expect mad visuals from baba Ifeanyi as usual e choke.” @NotJustSalmanPR tweeted: “These celebrities don’t know their influence on people. See the way Davido is cheating on Chioma openly. Now Davido fans will start seeing cheating as a normal thing.”
