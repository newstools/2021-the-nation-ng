Senate President Ahmad Lawan has received the first jab of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine at the National Assembly. The vaccine was administered on Lawan in his office by his personal physician, Dr. Muhammad Usman, and witnessed by some senators led by the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi. The vaccination card was presented to the Senate President by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Health (Secondary and Tertiary), Senator Ibrahim Oloriegbe. Speaking after he received the first jab of the vaccine, the Senate President called on Nigerians to make themselves available for the vaccination. “The COVID-19 pandemic is real. We are still facing that challenge and, therefore, I urge all Nigerians, especially those within the range specified by the health authorities and those at the frontline that we make ourselves available. “Even though this is a voluntary thing but it is advisable that as many Nigerians as possible should take the vaccine.  “We need to go on more sensitisation and advocacy. We need to make this vaccine available in all areas and different crannies of this country. “Let it not be limited to areas that are accessible only. We have areas that are not very much accessible in the riverine areas in the Niger Delta, in the northern-most part of the country and the desertified areas. “We need to reach out to the people. We should convince them. We should use the system that we have used before in getting our people vaccinated over the year. “Our traditional rulers, our traditional institutions have played very significant roles in enlightenment. “Our clergies. Our imams. This is something that we have to do because Nigeria is not an island. We are part of the global community.”
