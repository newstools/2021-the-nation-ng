As he plans to unveil his first body of work, rising singer Dike Bright Nnamdi aka DK Regan has been speaking on his excitement about his debut project while also taking stock of his journey into music. The singer announced himself last year with release of his debut single entitled ‘Big Chief’ produced by Jaysynths, producer of Teni’s hit songs, Uyo Meyo and Case. He followed up with a catchy video shot abroad by Mose Visuals. Taking a flashback on his journey into music, he disclosed. “I used to sing in the choir back then. Back then in those days, I used to have a friend whom together we traveled to a few local areas in Edo State to do some performances. I have been singing from a very young age and I believe that the time has come for me to bring my artistry to fruition. I believe the time is now to make a mark and a stand. “I am very persistent and consistent because I believe in the famous saying that what the mind of man can conceive, the hand of man can achieve. I’m a very disciplined and humble young man with great respect for my predecessors. This is one thing that has been keeping me going. I believe this positive attitude will one day take me to great heights in my career and aspirations,” he revealed further. Speaking about his upcoming EP project, DK Regan revealed that his first body of work will get Nigerian dancing.
