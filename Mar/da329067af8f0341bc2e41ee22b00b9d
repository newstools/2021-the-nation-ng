The Nation gathered that Shamaki died apparently  of anguish caused by the abduction of his daughter, Fatima Ibrahim. Fatina was identified as the girl with hijab in the video released by the bandits barely 24 hours after the abduction of the 39 students. In the video, Fatima speaking in Hausa, said the bandits threatened to kill all of them in the event of the government sending troops to rescue them. The students are spending their second week in captivity. Parents of the other kidnapped students met with officials of the state government and security chiefs yesterday in Kaduna on the fate of the abductees. The meeting was at the instance of the state government. Details of the meeting were not disclosed but it was gathered that it was attended by Internal Security and Home Affairs Commissioner, Samuel Aruwan, and top security chiefs to let the parents know that the government felt their pains and was doing its best to see to the safe release of the students. The parents had protested alleged inaction of the government in getting the students released . They had urged Governor Nasir El-Rufai to negotiate with the bandits to secure the safe release of their children. The bandits are demanding a N500 million ransom for their release.
