Southampton won for the first time in 10 Premier League matches as Che Adams’ spectacular strike helped Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side claim all three points at Sheffield United, whose slim survival hopes took another blow at Bramall Lane. Adams rifled a half-volley into the top corner four minutes into the second half, ending a run of 16 games without a goal in all competitions. Saints, who lost Danny Ings to an early injury, had broken the deadlock when James Ward-Prowse sent Aaron Ramsdale the wrong way from the penalty spot following Ethan Ampadu’s clumsy challenge on Nathan Tella. Takumi Minamino should have added a third for Southampton when he fired wide from Ryan Bertrand’s low cross, while Adams, Nathan Redmond and Stuart Armstrong all went close late on. “The first win after such a long time is always the most difficult one, now we have to keep on improving,” Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport afterwards. “We are looking in every direction and we still had some moments today in the game where we were not that controlled. But it’s normal after such a long run without a win.” On Ings’ injury, Hasenhuttl added: “I do not know yet [how serious it is]. It doesn’t look that good and it is a muscle injury.” The Blades had opportunities of their own but only tested Fraser Forster twice throughout the 90 minutes. The win lifts Saints 10 points clear of the relegation zone, while Chris Wilder’s side remain rooted to the foot of the table – 12 points from safety BBC Sport
