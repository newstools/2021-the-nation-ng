The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Anambra West Local Government Area of Anambra State on Thursday dismissed rumour that it had endorsed a particular aspirant for the November 6 governorship election. The party also refuted report purporting that the aspirant was endorsed by delegates during a consultative meeting in the area. The party disclosed this in a statement tagged, “Endorsement of Aspirants: Position of People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Anambra West Local Government Area” issued after an emergency meeting with members. The statement signed by the Chairman PDP, Anambra West LGA, Hon. Samuel Ozoekwe and the Anambra North PDP Vice Chairman, Chief Francis Udeoba, stressed that it was too early to announce any sort of endorsement for an aspirant, especially as they were still marketing themselves to the party faithful. The party statement read in part, “The attention of relevant critical stakeholders of People’s Democratic Party, Anambra West, has been drawn to the statement purporting to have been made at a consultative meeting with one of the aspirants which has been aired in both the national television and social media by agents of the “beneficiary” aspirant. “This is completely far from the truth as no such decision was ever conceived nor discussed in any of the party organs in the Local Government. It is a total distortion of the true account of what transpired and we dare say that the purported statement is at best quoted out of context. Such a scenario exists in the figment of the author’s imagination. “Anambra West PDP has very seasoned and reputable politicians who have enough knowledge to understand that it is too early in the day to announce any sort of endorsement to any aspirant especially as they are still marketing themselves to party faithful.”
