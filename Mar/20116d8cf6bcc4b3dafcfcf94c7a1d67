The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday said the conviction of Professor Peter Ogban by the Akwa Ibom High Court was a vindication and confirmation of the party’s resolve to sanitize the electoral process and rid it of malpractices. It also said that the judgement has nailed the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) whose agent used against APC candidate in the Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial election in 2019 was convicted on Wednesday. Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling party, Yekini Nabena in a statement in Abuja on Friday said PDP elements who made use of the University lecturer to rig out the APC’s candidate at the election should now bury their heads in shame. “We celebrate the Court’s pronouncement jailing one of the agents of the PDP used against our candidate (Akpabio) in the senatorial election in Akwa Ibom north-west in 2019. “We always believe that ‘if a lie goes for twenty years the truth will meet it one day. This judgement is significant in the sense that others like Prof. Ogban in the system should henceforth know that under the present Federal Government-APC’s administration, justice will always prevail.” According to Nabena, the Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial election was fraudulently postponed by the returning officer against the wish of the APC and its candidate and all the complaints made were not given attention.
