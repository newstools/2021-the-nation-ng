Robert Lewandowski scored a first-half hat-trick as 10-man Bayern Munich thrashed Stuttgart to go four points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Bayern’s Alphonso Davies was sent off after 12 minutes only for Lewandowski to open the scoring five minutes later. Serge Gnabry doubled Bayern’s advantage and Lewandowski completed his hat-trick with two further goals before half-time. The Poland striker has now scored 42 times for Bayern this season. With referee Daniel Schlager showing Davies a straight red for a foul on Stuttgart’s Wataru Endo, Bayern’s winning run – which stood at five going into Saturday’s game – initially looked in danger. However, three goals in the following 11 minutes put the game beyond doubt and the hosts cantered to all three points after the restart. In addition to surpassing Klaus Fischer on the all-time scorers list in the Bundesliga, Lewandowski is now only five goals away from equaling Gerd Müller’s single season record of 40 goals. With eight Bundesliga matches left to play, it’s incredibly hard to imagine that he won’t score at least five more goals.
