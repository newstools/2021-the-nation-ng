The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the appeal filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) challenging the ruling of the lower court in favour of Mr Dele Moses and 10 others. Justice Amina Augie, in the lead judgment held that the appeal had merit and therefore subsists. “This appeal is not a pre-election matter but purely a party affair, the appeal has merit, subsists and the Court of Appeals judgment is therefore set aside. “A political party is a voluntary body with its rules, regulations or guidelines which if you agree to be a member must obey and work within the rules’’. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that on Dec. 20, 2020, a Rivers High Court ruled that those who bought forms during the 2018 Congresses but were denied Participation rights should be incorporated in any new Congress of the party without them paying for new forms. The ruling was delivered by Justice George Omereji in the suit filed by some Chieftains of the All Progressive Congress APC, Dele Moses and nine others, against the party and its National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. Moses and nine others had prayed the court to order APC not to sell ward, Local Government and State Congresses nomination forms but should declare them the authentic party members. The court, however, denied their prayers that they be declared authentic members of APC and be entitled to own the Leadership of Rivers APC. Dele and others had prayed the court to order APC not to sell ward, Local Government and State Congresses nomination forms. The lower court had ruled that those who bought forms during the 2018 Congresses but were denied participation rights should be incorporated in any new Congress of the party without them paying for new forms.
