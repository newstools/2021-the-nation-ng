INSEAD, the Business School for the world, has announced the appointment of Nabila (Isa-Odidi) Aguele MBA’14J, to its Board of Directors, effective 18 June 2021. She is the youngest person appointed to the board, second African and second woman of African descent appointed. She is also the first Nigerian in the history of INSEAD. A Nigerian by origin, Aguele has called several countries home, including England, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the US, and Canada. After over a decade in the United States, her passion for Africa and desire to help drive sustainable impact and development on the Continent led her to move back to Nigeria as a Policy Advisor to the Federal Government in 2016. Currently, Aguele is a Special Adviser to Nigeria’s Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning. Professor Ilian Mihov, Dean of INSEAD, said of her appointment, “I am pleased to welcome Nabila as a new member on our Board.  Nabila has been an active member of the INSEAD community since she was an MBA student.  She has been a member of the INSEAD Campaign Board since 2019, and a member of the INSEAD Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Taskforce since 2020. I look forward to benefiting from her unique insights and expertise. “ “It is an honour to be joining the INSEAD Board of Directors. For me, this is a further call to serve, to champion, and to bring my diverse experiences and background to the role. I particularly look forward to helping deepen engagement with Africa, our young Alumni, and the global INSEAD community,” Aguele said.
