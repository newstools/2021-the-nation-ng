The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will continue to recognise only 18 political parties until the litigation on deregistration is resolved. The umpire advised the 74 deregistered parties to await the judgment of the Supreme Court on appeals relating to the powers of the Commission to deregister them in accordance with Section 225(A) of the constitution. The commission said it will obey court orders and abide by any judgment delivered by the apex Court. INEC Commissioner for Voter Education Festus Okoye noted the various letters of complaint emanating from the affected parties who have signified intention to field candidates for the Anambra State governorship election. He also noted that the deregistered parties hinge their request to nominate candidates on the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on June 11, 2020. Okoye said in a statement in Abuja the commission will continue to recognize and deal with only the 18 registered political parties, pending the final resolution and determination of the various appeals filed by the parties.
