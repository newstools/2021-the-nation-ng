 The Lagos Police Command has described as unacceptable the violent attack on two riot policemen by a mob in Computer Village. The armed policemen who were part of an anti-piracy team deployed to the market were seen in a viral video being assaulted and dragged by civilians with someone shouting ‘Ole! Ole!’ in the background. Checks by The Nation revealed that thugs in Computer Village on Friday morning descended on a task force put in place to check piracy and substandard goods in the market. While others fled, the two armed policemen were accosted and beaten before being dragged to the Area F Police Command, Ikeja. Their attackers were said to have been enraged by the frequent raids carried out by the task force which usually saw them seizing people’s wares including phones and other accessories. Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu in a statement by spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said the command has opened an investigation into the incident.
