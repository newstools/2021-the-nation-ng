The police in Delta State said they exhumed the body of a 54-year-old woman buried in a shallow grave by her abductors in a farm in Agbor off the Benin-Asaba Expressway. Police Commissioner Mohammed Ali said Mrs Philomena Ogadi who was kidnapped last week by a nine-man gang was killed and buried after collecting ransom. Ali said the victim hailed from Otolokpo in Ika Northeast council area of the state. He said her body was exhumed with gunshot injuries to her head and blindfolded. “After killing the woman and buried her, they went on calling her children and collecting ransom. So far, they have collected N650,000 from her children,” he said. The grandmother’s eldest son Nwante said one of the suspects lived in the same apartment as his mother.
