Super Eagles forward Victor Osimhen was named the man-of-the-match in Nigeriaâ€™s 3-0 victory over Lesotho in the finale game of the 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier played at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos yesterday. The Napoli striker was the toast of the Super Eagles, scoring one and assisting another as Nigeria finished with 14 points, top of Group L. Osimhen, who was a thorn in the flesh of the visitors , scored the curtain raiser in the 23rd minute, his 5th goal of the qualifiers. The Number 9 had received a delightful overhead pass from Kelechi Iheanacho before putting the ball beyond goalkeeper Sekhoane Moerane. The coach Gernot Rohr-led side played with so much confidence but failed to increase the tally with the score line at 1-0 at half time. After the restart, the three-time African champion continued with their dominating display with Alex Iwobi firing a fine shot from the edge of the box but failed to ruffle Lesotho goalkeeper. Osimhen then turned provider for the second goal in the 50th minute. The 22-year-old unselfishly gives the pass to Oghenekaro Etebo who was arriving in the box as he side-foots the ball into the back of the net. Nigeria sealed the game with seven minutes left when two substitutes combined, Henry Onyekuru teeing up Paul Onuachu who set himself up with the first touch before volleying past the keeper with his second.
