It is no longer news that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara State is working very hard to take over the government of the state from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. What is still shrouded in secrecy is the identity of the man they intend to push forward as their governorship candidate when the time comes. Expectedly, some chieftains of the party are being touted as being interested in the gubernatorial ticket. Sources say the party’s candidate in the last election – Razaq Atunwa – is one of such. According to insiders, the former Finance Commissioner has already set plans in motion to reactivate his political teams across the state in preparation for the task ahead. But sources within the Bukola Saraki political family told Sentry that unlike what obtained in 2019, when he enjoyed the backing of the former Senate President, Atunwa’s ambition may not have Saraki’s blessing this time. According to sources, “Senator Saraki is bent on fulfilling his promise to Kwara North senatorial district this time around. He will support a candidate from the north to run on the platform of the PDP in 2023.” Such positions notwithstanding, Sentry gathered Atunwa is determined to go all out and seek the party’s ticket once again. According to sources close to him, he believes strongly that he is still the best candidate PDP can throw into the race against the APC and the sitting governor. “Kwara people are wiser now, they will vote PDP if Atunwa, whom they know already, is presented to them in 2023,” the source claimed.
