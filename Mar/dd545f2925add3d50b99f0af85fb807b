Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been recalled to Sweden’s squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers, five years after retiring from international football. The AC Milan striker has been included in the squad for the games against Georgia on March 25 and Kosovo three days later, as well as a friendly against Estonia on March 31. The 39-year-old, who scored a national record 62 goals in 112 games for Sweden between 2001 and 2016, will become the oldest player in the history of the Swedish national team if he plays. Ibrahimovic took to social media to confirm the return, tweeting a picture with the words ‘The return of the God’.
