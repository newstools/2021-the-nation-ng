Eddie Hearn has insisted he did have the green light to announce that Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury signed to fight each other. AJ’s promoter told ESPN that the heavyweight champions have put pen to paper on a two-fight deal. But Fury’s UK backer Frank Warren hit out at Hearn and revealed their side were ‘not happy’ it was made public. Hearn, whose dad Barry once worked with Warren, explained the fight is not yet official, with a date and venue left to be agreed. But he simply responded to question on whether the fight had been signed, and said he had permission from Fury’s side to share the news. Hearn told iFL TV: “Yesterday’s interview, not announcement, interview with ESPN was, we didn’t want to make a big formal announcement and a fuss. But I wanted to let everyone know. “I spoke to Fury’s team and they were happy to convey to everybody that everybody had signed because it’s good news. It’s called momentum, it’s excitement. There are still hurdles to overcome.” But Hearn has reiterated that despite a deal being signed, no official announcement will come until there is a host and a date.
