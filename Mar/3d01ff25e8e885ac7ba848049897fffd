A Central Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama in Jos on Wednesday sentenced a 34-year-old, Chinese businessman, Arvin Wu to three months imprisonment for receiving stolen railway sleepers, property of the Nigerian Railway Corporation. A panel of two magistrates, Ghazali Adam and Hyacinth Dolnaan sentenced Arvin after he pleaded guilty to the offence. Magistrates Adam and Dolmaan, however, gave him an option to pay a fine of N50,000. Earlier, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) on Dec. 27, 2020, arrested the convict. The NSCDC said that the stolen property were recovered from Arwin. The offence, the NSCDC said, contravenes the provisions of Section 302 of Plateau Penal Code Law and also Section 3(1) (e) (i ) (f) of the NSCDC. (NAN)
