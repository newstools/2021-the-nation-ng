Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state on Wednesday commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the steps he is now taking to end insecurity in Nigeria. Ortom also said the fight against insecurity is the responsibility of every Nigerian and should not be politicised or regarded as a party issue. Ortom who said this in an interview with journalists at the Makurdi Airport after his meeting with the president stated that it was good the country has now been reawaken following the attack on him. He noted that after his meeting with the president in Abuja, he also met with some security chiefs and there is a new resolve to fight insecurity to a stand still. He said the attempted assassination on him ironically has brought a new resolve to end insecurity in the country. “The meeting in Abuja was very fruitful and Mr. President was quite sympathetic and condemned the attempted assassination on me. “I also met with some service chiefs, including the DSS, Chief of Defense Staff, the Inspector General of Police among others.”
