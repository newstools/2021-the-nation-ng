 Quadri Aruna yesterday cruised to the third round (round of 16) of the men’s singles after a convincing 3-1 win over Japan’s Masataka Morizono in the second round at the ongoing World Table Tennis (WTT) Star Contender, The Nigerian will again battle another Japanese star Harimoto Tamakazu in the third round today in his quest to exceed the quarterfinal finish he achieved at the WTT Contender Series last week in Doha, Qatar. Against Morizono, Aruna  dominated his opponent  from the first game which he won 11-6, he repeated the same form in the second game to win at 11-9. After conceding 11-1 in the third game, a determined Aruna returned to the table in the fourth game and he raised his performance to dominate from 7-7 before eventually winning at 11-7 to complete the 3-1 rout of his opponent.  With the win, Aruna now had an edge over Morizono in their three meetings with the Nigerian winning twice while the Japanese won once. Tomorrow, Aruna will be facing Harimoto  in what should be a thriller  since the Japanese had won all previous  meetings.  Meanwhile, Egypt’s Dina Meshref failed to advance to the third round after losing to Chinese Taipei’s Szu-Yu Chen 3-1 (19-17, 4-11, 9-11, 9-11) while her compatriot Ahmed Saleh also failed to progress after losing 3-0 (11-8, 11-5, 11-2) to  WTT Contender Series champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov of Germany.
