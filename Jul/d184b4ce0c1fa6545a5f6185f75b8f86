The Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) has called for an increase in federation allocation to local governments to 35.5 per cent. The group also called for abrogation of State and Local Government Joint Account and conduct council elections as at when due. In a communique issued by National Publicity Secretary Solomon Onah, after its NEC meeting in Enugu, ALGON reiterated demands for a uniform four-year tenure for council chairmen. Onah said: “ALGON has taken the initiative of bringing to an end multiple taxation of goods and services, and illegal road blocks across the country with National Anti-Multiple Taxation Scheme (NAMTAXS) and National Transit Insurance Scheme (NATIS).  This will optimally address food security challenges, reduce cost of goods and inflation in the country and strengthen the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the councils in collaboration with the States, Federal Government and their stakeholders.  NEC is happy that the projects will seek to assemble all the road users and capture them into its tax net. NEC equally set up a five man committee to properly harmonise all modalities for their take off and report back in two weeks for implementation.”
