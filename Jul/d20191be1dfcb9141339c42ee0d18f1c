The Nigerian Youth Advocate for Good Governance Initiative and All Progressives Congress National Youth Caucus for North West Zone have called on party leaders and members in Zamfara State and Nigeria to remain loyal to the ruling party. The APC youth wing group urged members of the party to refrain from any form of incitement that can cause unrest within the ruling party. The group made the call in a release jointly signed by its leaders, Nakura Kaseem and Maxwell Nathaniel in Abuja yesterday. The group, reacting to the recent defection of Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle to APC from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), urged party faithful to emulate the leadership qualities of a former Governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari who, alongside other party leaders, received the Matawalle into the APC. “The Zamfara State APC was led by the former Governor Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar (Shattiman Mafara), before the event which has now shifted leadership of the party to the current Governor who decamped to the party recently. “However, that notwithstanding, a leader is a leader and the indefatigable Yari still prides himself as the Supreme Leader of the APC in the state. “Many see it as an unsettling development between the duo (former and present Governors). God made it possible for people with integrity, charisma, such as Shattiman Mafara, who have always believed in the decision of God as an answer to their desire. “Abdulaziz Yari as a leader of the party has welcomed his childhood and best friend, Governor Bello Matawalle into the party with a good heart and clean mind, to work together, to move Zamfara state forward,” the statement said.
