Yomi Fabiyi made this known via his insta story on July 5, 2021. He wrote: “I have asked that they pull or private the movie for sake of peace. The movie is however to correct CHILD ABUSE, ASSAULT, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE AND OTHER VICES and to state clearly I am not what they claim I am initially. “Don’t rush on any negative narrative guys. I am human but will never down play the real issues that concerns children. It is just an expression and I respect polite and superior arguments or opinion. Thank you lovelies.”
