A Catholic Priest Rev. Fr. Elijah Wada who was kidnapped by Boko Haram last month has regained freedom. The Nation reported Wada was kidnapped on June 30, 2021, along Biu/Damboa road, which he mistakenly followed on his way to Damaturu, Yobe State. Reliable sources informed The Nation that the priest regained freedom last Thursday evening. “The news of the freedom of our brother is true. We thank God for his life. We are grateful to God for the cheering news,” an official in the Diocese, who is not authorised to talk to the media informed. No official statement has been issued by the Catholic Diocese of Maiduguri but parishioners are celebrating the release of the kidnapped priest on social media, including WhatsApp platforms. “Haven’t you heard that the priest you reported that he was kidnapped has now regained his freedom from the hands of his abductors? He was freed last Thursday,” one of the parishioners informed. It is not clear how the priest was released but there are different narratives on the incident. While others alleged the Diocese paid the ransom for his release, others said the Reverend Father escaped with other captives from the hands of their abductors. An official of the church told The Nation the Bishop will soon communicate with the media on the matter at an appropriate time. The Nation gathered the priest is undergoing medical treatment and trauma counselling at an undisclosed location.
