Gareth Southgate and Harry Kane expect a tough game against Italy, but the England boss warns: ‘Finals are to be won.’ The Three Lions and Italy meet in the UEFA Euro 2020 Final at Wembley on Sunday, July 11.
It kicks off at 8 pm UK time. “Finals are there to be won. We’ll regroup and prepare properly. We need to recover tonight, it’s taken a lot physically and mentally. Italy have also had that – although they’ve had an extra day to recover,” Southgate told UEFA.com after England’s win over Denmark in the semi-finals. “We’ve got to enjoy the fact we’re in the final but there’s one more massive hurdle to conquer. Italy are a very good side, I’ve thought that for the last couple of years. They are in outstanding form and have defensive warriors who have been through everything. It’s a great game to look forward to.” Harry Kane scored the winner from a penalty rebound in the extra time. “We know it’s going to be a very tough game against Italy,” the Tottenham striker said. “We’ve had a great tournament so far. One more game to go at home, and we can’t wait.”
