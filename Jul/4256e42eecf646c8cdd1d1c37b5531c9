Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has hailed construction giant, Julius Berger Plc, for constructing good roads and flyovers across the state. Most of the projects the company handled were completed ahead of schedule for the governor and his special guests to inaugurate. The projects, which were complemented with street lights for beauty and night security, include William Jumbo Street, Ernest Ikoli Street, Eleme Street, Akasa Street and Obagi Street, all within the old Port Harcourt G.R.A. Simultaneously, the state government also gave the green light for Julius Berger to begin the construction of two and major infrastructural development projects. One of them is the Ngbuiitawo road in Emohwa Local Government Area, which the special guest of honour and former Benue State Governor Gabriel Suswan, flagged off. The other project is the construction of the Rumuepirikom Flyover at Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, described as Flyover 9 by the Nyesom Wike administration. Both projects are part of the Urban Renewal Programme of Governor Wike’s administration for which Julius Berger has been a dependable engineering contractor and partner. During the inauguration ceremonies, Wike expressed satisfaction with Berger’s good work and hailed the construction giant for its increasing and impeccable project quality, integrity and reliability.
