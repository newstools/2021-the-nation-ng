Matron of Nigeria’s most exotic golf club, The Golf Garden Waterfront (GGWF) in Wuse, Abuja, Chief Olusegun Runsewe, has broken new grounds with the release of a book on the history of golf in Nigeria. The 210-page book is expected to be released to the public on October 1. The book dwells extensively on the nation’s  golf sojourn for over 150 years, especially from years the colonial  merchants who were dealing in rubber started the game in Sapele, Delta State, through the years the white tin miners in Jos, Plateau State,  further exposed the game to Nigerians.  Clearly motivated by his experience in several trips to world’s ‘golf shrines’ like the ancient and modern St. Andrews, the world’s golf headquarters,  and the Professional Golf Association (PGA) of America. Runsewe  paints clear pictures of how  golf evolved in Nigeria and those individuals who made selfless sacrifice to ensure golf was forced from the tight grips of the white settlers and passed on to  Nigerians who wanted to play it. The book dwells on why  cultural golf attires are being introduced in Nigeria and prominent Nigerians like Oba Ewuare 11 of Benin and Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong who are already adorning the attires. “We have a long and rich history of golfing in Nigeria”, Runsewe, who is the Director General of the National Council of Arts and Culture said. Ï hold this belief that if we cannot write our own golf history, nobody will do it for us. This is why I embarked on this project and I must tell everyone  it was such a thrilling experience”.
