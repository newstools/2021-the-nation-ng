Students of Vivian Fowler memorial College have featured in the FTC APOC 2021 global robotics competition as the only girl-child African School. FIRST is the world’s leading youth-serving nonprofit advancing STEM education and inspires young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators. Vivian Fowler Memorial College was part of the 40 FTC teams around the globe that participated in a remote event hosted by faculty of science and Engineering, Macquarie University in Sydney Australia. The event had live robot rounds, alliances, judging, and getting to meet amazing people that are all excited about robots and STEM! Director of the College, Mrs. Olufunke Fowler-Amba, stated the future is technology and as a result, the curriculum has to be redirected. The college, according to her, has been engaging in collaboration to provide qualitative educational delivery. She said: “We need a curriculum that prepares students for the 21st century. The school included robotics in her curriculum in 2017 and partnered with organisations to support the programme.  “The school also has a synergy within its community to coordinate the teachers. Teachers with background in technology are sourced more in view of the need to develop a more enriching curriculum. “We are poised to become a technologically oriented team and schools changing the face of women in the work force. We are raising successful women in career and in all spheres of life.” Leader of the Vivian Fowler College’s 15-member team, Adeyimika Adebayo, said robotics has allowed them to pay attention to details and plan appropriately. Leaders of builders of the robots presented for the competition Leila Eneche and Harriet Ariyo said they pushed themselves beyond the limit to construct their robots and make them unique for the competition. They pointed out they had to work tirelessly with the support of the school to construct their innovative robots for the competition.
