The Senate has given reasons for the rejection of the nomination of Personal Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on New Media, Lauretta Onochie, as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). It said her nomination was rejected because of her partisanship and breach of the federal character principle.

Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kabiru Gaya (APC, Kano South) was quoted as saying the committee also received several petitions against her nomination. He explained the petitions bothered on her involvement in politics and alleged membership of a political party. He explained further that her nomination violated the Federal Character Principle as there is already a serving National Electoral Commissioner from Delta State, Barr. Mary Agbamuche-Mbu who was screened and confirmed by the 8th Senate. “In the case of Ms. Lauretta Onochie’s, having studied her curriculum vitae and other relevant documents, followed by exhaustive interaction around the petitions against her nomination which she responded to accordingly, including attesting that she is not a registered member of any political party,” Gaya said. According to the lawmaker, the Committee bound by the provisions of Section 14(3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as Amendment) on Federal Character Principle, refused to recommend Onochie for confirmation. “Therefore, based on the provisions of Section 14(3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as Amended) on Federal Character Principle as earlier stated, and in order for the Committee and the Senate to achieve fairness to other states and political zones in the country, the committee is unable to recommend Ms. Lauretta Onochie for confirmation as a National Electoral Commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission,” he explained. However, the Senate confirmed five other nominees followed the consideration of a report by the Senate Committee on INEC.
