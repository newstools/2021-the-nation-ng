Reported cases of kidnappings and abductions across the country are getting worrisome and terrifying every day. It’s clear that bandits are having a field day, especially in the North, abducting at will, demanding and receiving ransoms freely. Sadly, pupils and students have been killed by the bandits because their parents or guardians’ delay in paying the usual huge ransom. Down the memory lane, kidnapping for ransom on a ‘commercial scale’ became rampant in 2011, spreading across States of the country. Usually, the prime targets of kidnapping for ransom are those considered wealthy to pay ransom. But now, the story has changed, no one is safe. Either money or its material equivalent is usually requested or to be paid as ransom.
