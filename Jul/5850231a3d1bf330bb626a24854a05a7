Embattled Sunday Igboho on Saturday wrote a petition to the federal government protesting damage to his residence, cars and other property by state agents. He estimated his losses at N500million and demanded same as reparation. Igboho, in a letter through his counsel Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN) also sought a public apology for what he called violation of his fundamental rights during the invasion of his house and the institution of a probe of the action of the security officials that conducted the raid. He equally implored all the Governors of Southwest States that “know the yearnings of their people and Igboho’s large followership to wade in before it becomes hydra headed security problems in all their domains.” Counsel alleged that those arrested in Igboho’s house were being tortured to incriminate him that guns and ammunition were recovered from his house. He said: “Sunday Igboho knew that he would be arrested one day hence retaining our services. He could not be that daft to keep incriminating articles in his house! “Our client’s house is a 5 bedroom duplex with 5 chalets of 2 and 3 bedrooms. These were totally damaged with operatives allegedly arguing on whether to burn down the edifice as done to his former palatial house. The lady officer allegedly put her foot down against arson.”
