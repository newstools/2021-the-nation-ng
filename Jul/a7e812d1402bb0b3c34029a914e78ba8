The joy of water was evident in Isolo, Irepodun community, in Akure, Ondo State when the residents took delivery of a solar-powered borehole. The facility was gifted them by Rotimax Integrated Services Ltd, a pest-control and fumigation company and owners of Alcochem Hygiene Nigeria. The gesture ended years of misery, for all they had were wells and a river. Speaking during the inauguration of the borehole, MD Tolu Caleb said they chose the community because he grew up there, “and I know the challenges of the community. As a young chap then, there was only one groundwater well in the community and a river so whenever there was scarcity of water it was hellish for us.” The project cost the company some millions, Caleb said, adding that his company has a lot of CSR programmes lined up for the year, including paying medical bills for indigent patients. “We also plan to continue providing food, clothes and money to community people as we have always done. We are also looking at going to schools to donate sanitary towels to the young girls and books to libraries as well.” Chairman at the event, Pastor Wole Oniyere expressed happiness for the gesture.
