PSG are considering offering star man Kylian Mbappe a mega-money contract to convince him to remain at the club. Mbappe has only one year remaining on his current deal with the Parisians and has left the door open to a potential exit. The 22-year-old is one of the most sought-after players in world football and is faced with a big decision to make about his next step in the game. Plenty of top European clubs are fully aware of his contract expiration date approaching, with Real Madrid among those carefully monitoring the situation.  Los Blancos have made Mbappe their number one transfer priority this summer as they search for their latest Galactico. They  are reportedly  hoping to offload a number of first-team players this summer in order to relieve their bloated wage bill and raise funds to sign the club’s number one transfer target: Mbappe. The Athletic report that Los Blancos would ideally shift expensive flops Gareth Bale and Eden Hazard, who make up 13% of the club’s salary budget. Elsewhere, the likes of Isco, Luka Jovic, Martin Odegaard and Dani Ceballos could all be sold.
