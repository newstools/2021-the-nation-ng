Many residents of a community in Nkanu East council area of Enugu State have fled their homes following the reported invasion of the community by soldiers. The reporter’s attempts to visit the village, Agudene, were abortive as transporters avoided the area due to the soldiers’ reported presence. The soldiers were also said to have burnt down a house in the community. Some residents said the invasion started on Wednesday and continued till yesterday, adding that the soldiers came in about eight Hilux vans and were still parading the village yesterday evening. The Nation gathered that the invasion was probably connected to the ejection of herdsmen from Akpawfu forests by youths following incessant destruction of farmlands and crops by their cattle. Village sources said that since that ejection in March, soldiers have been coming to the community and arresting youths, calling them members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, 82 DV, Enugu, Col. Abubakar Abdullahi, declined to comment on the incident and and did not take his calls afterwards, nor did he respond to text messages.
