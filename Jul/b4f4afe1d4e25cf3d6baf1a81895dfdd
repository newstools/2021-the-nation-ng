 The Osun State government has placed the state on red alert, as two patients lost their lives to the new variant of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Oyo State. The state government yesterday harped on adherence to safety protocols and non-pharmaceutical guidelines to prevent the virus. A statement by the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, said the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced last Friday that it had confirmed a case of the SARS-CoV-2, known as the Delta variant in Nigeria, adding that the variant had been recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a variant of concern. “We enjoin citizens to continue to take personal responsibility for their safety. Non-adherence to safety protocols among citizens may produce unpleasant outcomes. We advise residents not to let down their guard or be lured into a false sense of security that the world is totally out of the grips of COVID-19.  “The arrival of the new Delta variant is a signal to us that we cannot let down our guards. It has ushered in the third wave in other parts of the world, and its strain has been found in Nigeria – as a matter of fact, in Oyo State. “Therefore, we cannot pretend that Osun is an island considering our people engage in trade and social activities with this neighbouring state. “We should also be aware that the new variant has a high rate of mutation and it is deadlier. The worst part is that it does not have the same symptoms as the variants experienced in the first and second wave. It presents just as body ache, devoid of dry cough and fever. So, we need to be mindful of the symptoms and go to the hospital when we feel unwell.”
