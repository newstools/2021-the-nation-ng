Former governor of Plateau, Sen. Jonah Jang says the state chapter of his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), will soon resolve its internal disagreements and emerge stronger. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Plateau PDP has been   enmeshed in series of crises that led to the dissolution of the elected state executive committee of the party. The National Secretariat of the party on June 11 constituted an independent caretaker committee headed by Sen. Tunde Ogbeha to resolve the issues and conduct state congress within 90 days. Jang stated this on Monday in Jos while addressing newsmen shortly after a meeting between the party’s elder’s council and the state caretaker committee. The former governor assured supporters that with the coming of the caretaker committee, all parties had resolved to give them all the support needed to resolve the issues. “We will give the committee all the support to ensure the disagreements that almost brought the party down are resolved. “I want to assure our supporters that we are going to participate in the forthcoming local government elections because PDP has an executive committee in place in form of caretaker headed by Sen.Tunde Ogbeha. “Ogbeha is a very honest gentleman. He is not here to support anybody but to do what will bring PDP back to life again,” he said. Chief Fidelis Tapgun, another former governor of the state and PDP Chieftain, also expressed optimism that the Ogbeha -led  committee would resolve the issues. Tapgun said  the meeting was a continuation of discussions the committee had been holding with stakeholders. “We have assured the committee of our support to resolve the lingering problems. “We have been scattered  for too long and it is time for us to build it up and PDP will be back to life,” he added.
