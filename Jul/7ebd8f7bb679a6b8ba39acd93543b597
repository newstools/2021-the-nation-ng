The Army has begun a four-day training for its chief clerks to strengthen information security and prevent leakage of official documents. It held at the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Ordnance Corps (NAOC) in Lagos State. Army chief clerks are non-commissioned officers (NCOs) attached to administrative departments and units for clerical duties. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt.-Gen. Farouk Yahaya, who opened the convention, said it was designed to remind participants to uphold the Official Secrets Act. According to him, the training would enable soldiers develop capacity and enhance performance in their duties as trained confidential secretaries, personal assistants and chief clerks of various formations and units. Gen. Yahaya, who was represented by Commandant of Nigerian Army College of Logistics (NACOL) Maj.-Gen. Martins Enendu reminded participants that they were custodians of documents and must guide against leakage of information. He warned against falsification of documents/signatures, late/non-rendition of returns, unauthorised publications and dissemination/disclosure of classified information to the press or other unreliable audiences, describing such as unpatriotic acts that could have consequences on the image of the Army. The COAS said: â€œThis training is designed to bring us all on the same page towards ensuring such leakages are checkmated. Disclosures from theatre of operations may not in all cases be limited to structured manner of handling information; some of these leakages are from men in the field and, sometimes, even from people who are not soldiers. We are here for the structured manner of handling document security and I think we would achieve the objectives. General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division Maj.-Gen. Lawrence Fejokwu hoped the trainees were better informed.
