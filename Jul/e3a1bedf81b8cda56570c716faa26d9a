Nigeria’s FIFA Council member Amaju Pinnick ) would need to remain as president of the nation’s soccer governing body, Nigeria Football Federation(NFF) to keep his seat on the world’s soccer decision-making body of the organization. Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle Group, Ebi Egbe, explained as much in a release , adding administering football and other sports is quite different from partisan politics where one takes a bow after two terms. He said: “In International football, there is no provision that says that one must do two terms and quit. In the case of Pinnick , we must thank God that he has succeeded in finding his way into FIFA and to fully benefit from it, we need to make him remain at the Abuja Glass House of NFF. “ It would not be helpful to us as a country if we have a man in FIFA who is not in charge as our soccer federation President.” Egbe charged the nation’s football stakeholders to rally round Amaju by offering him another mandate to remain as NFF president after the expiration of his present tenure. It would be noted that Amaju remains the only NFF president that has won a second term in office. Amaju was returned in the election held in Katsina, said he would not want to contest again for the NFF presidency.
