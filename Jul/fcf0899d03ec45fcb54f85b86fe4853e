Junior Firpo transferred to Leeds United. Barca transfers it for 15 million and saves 20% in a future sale. He’s Barcelona’s fourth exit this summer The Dominican Republic-born 24-year-old has been biding his time in Leeds for the majority of the past week, awaiting the all-clear to have a medical and complete a move to Elland Road from Camp Nou. Leeds have paid a fee in the region of €15m plus add ons for the defender, who spent two years with the Spanish giants after moving from Real Betis. He underwent a medical last night as Leeds completed the paperwork at their end, and Barcelona president Joan Laporta signed off on the deal this morning. Firpo, who has signed a four-year contract that runs to the summer of 2025, was straight into training with Marcelo Bielsa’s squad today as they are put through a triple session. Despite interest from Serie A clubs, including AC Milan, Leeds were able to convince former Spain Under 21 international of the merits of a move to the Premier League to work under Marcelo Bielsa.
