TRACE TV has developed an interesting ecosystem through its multiple channels to tap into the rich youth culture in Africa. In a bid to further empower the younger generation with life-changing content arming them with vital skills to stand independently on their own, Trace TV has launched TRACE Troops, a multi-directional tribe community platform for young West Africans willing to be trendsetters and young leaders in their respective fields. The new programme is expected to serve as a community of Afro-urban youths genuinely interested in shaping the culture and society with education, entertainment, and empowerment. According to Trace, the Trace Troop programme is a CSR initiative that will hire a group of 15 youths from age 16-28 years for a three month period in paid internships starting from July 22, 2021 to October 21, 2021. This learning and mentorship process will empower selected youths with resources and guidance on media and entertainment.Â  Before the completion of their program, interns will have the opportunity to produce a project of their own choice.
