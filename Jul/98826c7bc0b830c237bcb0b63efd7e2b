Fast growing financial technology company, Tangerine has launched its financial service products in Lagos. The company, at a press conference in Lagos, also announced its target to be the foremost tech-driven financial solutions provider in Nigeria, and an expansion plan to eight African countries by 2024. The media event had the company top executives: Livingstone Magorimbo (Head, Life Insurance, Tangerine Nigeria; Dapo Akinsanya, Head, Pensions, Tangerine Nigeria and Ibitunde Balogun, Head, Commercial, Tangerine Nigeria; reeling out its rapid success story since its acquisition of 100 per cent equity stake in Metropolitan Life Insurance Nigeria by leading private equity firm, Verod Capital Management in September, 2019. That move was immediately followed by a stream of strategic mergers and acquisitions, notably ARM Life through Metropolitan Life to establish Tangerine Life Insurance Limited, the 4th largest life insurer in Nigeria; acquisition of Law Union and Rock, one of the leading general insurance companies in the space, now rebranded: Tangerine General Insurance Limited; and the acquisition of Assured MFB, a microfinance bank, by Tangerine Life which transmuted to Tangerine Money. In the pensions space, Tangerine, through Verod, also acquired Pension Fund Administrators (PFA) – AXA Mansard Pension and a minority stake in a significant PFA by Verod, to become Tangerine Pensions. Aside assembling a strong, agile and experienced team that aligns with its strategic thinking, Akisanya said, the company, in line with the ongoing recapitalization in the industry, has successfully increased its statutory capital levels for life and general insurance businesses from N2 billion to N8 billion and N3 billion to N10 billion respectively. Sharing its plan to be first  in Africa, Magorimbo said, “Our intention over the next 3 to 4 years is to build strong businesses that are profitable and have a fair share of the larger market, in all of the segments we participate in. “The issue of real time claims processing is one of our target deliverables, as we continue to look for operational efficiencies to add value to our customers and distribution partners”. He said the company also has plans to have a presence in at least eight African countries by 2024.
