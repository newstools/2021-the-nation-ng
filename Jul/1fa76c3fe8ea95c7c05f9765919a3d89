Two weeks ago, Minister of Labour and Productivity, Chris Ngige, faulted the outcome of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary conducted in Anambra State. He described the results as a ‘total fabrication.’ Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, who chaired the APC primary election committee, had announced that former Senator Andy Uba won the contest. He was said to have scored 230,201 votes, beating 13 other aspirants to emerge as the flagbearer. On the day of the primary election, 11 of the 14 APC governorship aspirants claimed that the June 26 primary in the state did not hold. But it appears the national leadership of the party is satisfied with the announced outcome. Surprisingly, Ngige, who is leader of the party in the state, has kept mute over the election, leaving many of his supporters to wonder if he has accepted the disputed outcome. Speaking to Sentry during the week, one of the gubernatorial aspirants confessed that Ngige’s silence was worrisome. “We are worried he is no longer talking. We rely very much on him to ensure this injustice is reversed,” he said. A chieftain of the party also wondered what could be happening. “I cannot say exactly what is happening. It is true our leader is silent for now but it may not be correct to say the issue has been resolved,” he said. But a source within the Minister’s inner circle told Sentry that the former governor’s silence was calculated. “His silence is speaking louder than noise to those who should hear him. Ngige is not one to fight aimlessly. Complaints have been sent where they ought to be sent and it is normal to hold our peace and see what happens,” he said.
