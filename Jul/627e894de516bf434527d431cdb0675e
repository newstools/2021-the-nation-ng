A US-based Nigerian artist and music composer, Mezuo, has praised the success so far recorded by ‘Clash’, a movie directed by Pascal Atumah, a Nigerian-Canadian. Mezuo said this before the Global Netflix release of the movie on July 7th. Mezuo, who composed the music score for the hit movie, said: “I watched the film (Clash) twice before I started composing any music so that I could digest the story being told. “I remember taking off my headphones and turning to Pascal and telling him that the story had a global reach and that this is going to be fun to work on. “I’m not surprised at the fact that the film trended number 1 in Africa on Netflix upon release because the film has an infectious energy top to bottom. “Being able to drive the story home through the music was a pleasure and I’m ready for similar results from a global perspective.” The Houston Texas-born artist recently released his debut music video for his song “30” which has received positive reviews across press outlets in the states. Clash has a star-studded cast drawn from Nollywood to Hollywood and beyond. Among the cast are Stephanie Okereke-Linus, Omoni Oboli, Brian Hooks, Merlisa Langellier, Vivian Williams, Pascal Atuma and many others. It explores the identity crisis of a young Nigerian who for many years lived a lie with a misconception that his uncle was his biological father. He had also to grapple with the complexities of multi-racial relationships. The movie captures the journey of the young man to discover his biological father in the midst of love and a multicultural society. In the movie, culture clashes with -love, reality, truth, lies and environment.
