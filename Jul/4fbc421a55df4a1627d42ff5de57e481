Marco Verratti believes that England were fortunate to receive a penalty in their 2-1 win over Denmark after extra time in their Euro 2020 semi-final on Wednesday. Raheem Sterling went to the ground after some slight contact in the box, with Harry Kane then missing from the spot but tapping in on the rebound. The goal was enough for England to book their place on Sunday’s final, where they’ll face Italy. “It was a generous penalty,” Verratti said, speaking to the press yesterday. “I wouldn’t have given it. It was an important goal and they won, but let’s say that the penalty was generous.   “We’re happy that they won. Now we’re going to play what will be a historic final for both teams.”
Evaluating England as a team, though, Verratti knows that Gli Azzurri need to be respectful of the Three Lions’ talent. “We all watched the game together,” Verratti said. “England have physical and technical players and are very good. They deserve to be in the final. “It’s a final, I don’t know [if there will be fear]. We both want to win, we’ll play a great team and they’re playing at home in a stadium that they know very well. “To win a final like this would be a dream come true.”
