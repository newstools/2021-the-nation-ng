ENGLISH singer of Nigerian descent, Zion Foster has shared how his recent visit to Nigeria inspired his upcoming EP ‘Long Live Lagos’. Zion, who strongly identifies with his Nigerian roots, is based in the United Kingdom. He disclosed this recently during his unreleased EP’s listening party, saying, “Really I’ve been feeling out of place in the United Kingdom, obviously I’m appreciated for what I do and people know I’m talented but I just feel like the UK is not ready to accept something different so I was already looking for somewhere to go that I will be a bit freer and accepted for what I do and truly am, so I had the opportunity to work with Zlatan and that pushed me to come to Nigeria and ever since I came, I never look back, the freedom here the acceptance, the love here is different from anywhere I’ve ever been”. During his stay in Nigeria, he released his lead single featuring Zlatan entitled ‘Carry me go’ with visuals shot by music video director, Sesan. Speaking on the inspiration behind the EP, he said “When I came here I just believed that there was so much potential in this country, in this city, I just wanted to uplift Lagos, we have a long life ahead of us, there’s a lot more greatness to come and there’s a lot of mixed feelings that I’ve been getting back from feedbacks when I speak to people but I see something here that is beyond great. I see a lot of potentials so I just wanted to uplift Lagos long live Lagos.” Describing his sound, he said “My sound is RnB, the vocals are RnB/ Soul, Gospel but because of my environment and my experiences it just changes, I will use the same voice but I can open an Afrobeat, I can open a straight RnB song, I can open a hip hop song but my underline baseline is RnB”, he said. His upcoming 8-track EP will also feature American singer, Rotimi, and Nigerian rapper, Mohbad and singer Buju.
