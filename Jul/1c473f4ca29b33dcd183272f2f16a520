Ex-international, Emmanuel Amuneke has said the most important factor on the field of play is communication between the players starting from the defense to the attackers. The former FIFA U-17 World Cup winner said oftentimes the players failed to talk to each other during a game, leading to a costly loss in major championships. Speaking in Lagos yesterday during a training session with grassroots coaches and some players, Amuneke said he decided to come out and train some grassroots coaches because he was passionate about developing the game in Nigeria. He called on the players to be always business-minded rather than playing for fame. “There must be communication on the field starting from the goalkeeper to the other outfield players. Coming here today was just my way of giving back and I am happy that the players and the coaches were able to learn one or two things. “I really want to appreciate all the people that made themselves available. “We don’t have youth instructors that can teach the players from a young age, if we had done this long time, it would have been just to teach perfection, but we will continue as much as we could.” Speaking on behalf of the coaches, Alaba Oke, of Paddysco Academy, Festacthanked Amuneke for coming around and giving back to them. The only female coach during the training, Ogochukwu Ursala, said it was a great moment learning under coach Amuneke.
