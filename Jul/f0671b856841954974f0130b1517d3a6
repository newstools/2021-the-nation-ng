Charly Boy has revealed how he predicted global acceptance which many Nigerian musics acts like Burna Boy, Wizkid and Davido are enjoying. In an exclusive chat with The Nation, Charly Boy said he predicted a time would come when Nigerian artists will be respected globally. “Isn’t that what I said 20 years ago when they were treating the Nigerian artists anyhow. I said there would come a time when Nigerian artists will be respected. “We haven’t even hit the glass ceiling yet, this is just a tip of the iceberg,” Charly Boy revealed. Continuing, the Area Father said many of the current music acts are quick to forget that some individuals fought for the acceptance and respect they now enjoy globally. “What people keep forgetting is that there were people who fought for that to happen. There were people who respect and fought for the big money which is what the current crop of artists are enjoying and of course it could be better in terms of the administration because music has become very cheap now. “It could always be better. But it is a far cry from where we were especially during my tenure as a PMAN president and where we are now is like night and day.” Charly boy however said: “There is still room for a lot of improvement. I want to now start to see a lot more of our artists on the world stage.”
