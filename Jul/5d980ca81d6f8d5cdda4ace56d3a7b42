USAIN Bolt has hit out at the ‘horrible’ racist abuse directed at Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho following England’s Euro 2020 heartbreak to Italy, claiming that he would not have made the youngsters take the decisive spot kicks. And Olympic champion Bolt, an avid follower of football, has leapt to the defence of the youngsters, labelling the abuse in the wake of the Euro 2020 final as ‘horrible’ and ‘unfair’. “First of all that’s horrible to know – for me it’s very tough to see these things,” he said.
