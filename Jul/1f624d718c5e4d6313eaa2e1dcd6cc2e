Kaduna High Court on Thursday adjourned till July 28 to rule on the defence counsel’s no-case submission in the trial of the leader of Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Ibrahim Zakzaky, and his wife, Zeenat. Justice Gideon Kurada adjourned the matter after the prosecution and counsel to the defendants had addressed the court on the prayer by the defence. Addressing reporters after yesterday’s sitting of the “secret trial” of Zakzaky, his lead counsel, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), prayed the court to rule in favor of his clients. He said: “The prosecution and the defence addressed the Court on the no-case submission prayer. “We did indicate last time that even though the prosecution called 15 witnesses, we felt that no case has been established to warrant our clients being in court. In other words, we addressed the court that there is nothing to defend. “The court took our addresses and adjourned till July 28 for ruling on the no-case submission.” The prosecution’s lead counsel in the “secret trial”, Mr. Dari Bayero, had, at the close of their submission on March 31, prayed the court to sentence the defendants. Bayero had asked the court to overrule the defence and sentence Zakzaky and his wife, as provided by the law. “We are satisfied with the way the case has gone so far. We have presented 15 witnesses, including Army generals, who are key actors and players that led to the filing of the case against the IMN leader. “One of our prayers is that the court should overrule the no-case submission, overrule the defence, convict the defendants accordingly and pass the necessary sentence, as provided for in the law,” he said.
