The Olympic torch relay has been scrapped on Tokyo’s public roads, officials announced Wednesday, as virus concerns continue to plague the Games just over two weeks before they begin. The latest setback comes only a day before International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach is due to arrive in Japan for the postponed mega-event. And with coronavirus an infection on the rise again in Japan, the government is expected to this week extend restrictions that are likely to affect how many fans – if any – can attend the Games. The Olympic flame arrives in Tokyo tomorrow , but private torch-lighting ceremonies will replace the relay across the capital to prevent crowds gathering to watch, the city government said. Right up to the opening ceremony on July 23, the torch ceremonies will be streamed online, with authorities urging spectators to watch them “in the comfort of your home”. Only the relay leg in the Ogasawara islands – a remote archipelago some 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) south of Tokyo – will go ahead in public as scheduled.
