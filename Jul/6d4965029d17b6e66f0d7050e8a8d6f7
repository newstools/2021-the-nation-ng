A school, Premiere Academy, Lugbe, Abuja, has pledged full cooperation with the police to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of a 14-year-old pupil of the school Keren-Happuch Akpagher. The SS1 pupil, Karen-Happuch, was allegedly sexually abused, leading to her withdrawal from the school by her Mrs Vihimga Akpagher, on June 19, for treatment. Karen-Happuch died two days later in hospital. Principal of the school, Mr. Chris Akinsowon said no effort would be spared in unravelling how the pupil died. “No stone will be left unturned in our quest to get to the root of this matter as a school and parents to find the real cause of the unfortunate demise of our dear daughter and further forestall such incidents in the future,” he told reporters. “In light of this incident, we have honoured the invitation from the police investigating the case, where we cooperated with them and stated our commitment in assisting them in their quest to unravel the controversies.”
