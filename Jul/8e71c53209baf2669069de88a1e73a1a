Tech educational partner for enterprise and governments, Elev8 education has announced plans to train up to 1000 companies by 2022 in technology specialised programmes to help businesses live up to their full potential. Speaking at a media meet hosted by elev8 education, Country Head Ashim Egunjobi said ‘’the country is still recovering from the economic effects and we realise that businesses/ companies both public and private are also struggling to stay afloat. ‘’As we enter into the second half of the year, it is imperative to look back, strategise and ensure that companies make use of all necessary technological tools available moving forward to scale up their operations to meet their goals. ‘’These technological advances and tools have been proven to enable  businesses to work more efficiently in several different ways and while  Information technology drives innovation and innovation is the path to business success’’. Elev8’s commitment is to help equip IT specialists, business managers, and leaders  in over 1000 companies by 2022 to upskill and reskill so that they can comprehend, adapt, and thrive in the ever-changing digital landscape  and turn to raise value chain and putting money back into the economy. As Nigeria struggles to keep up with the rest of the world, there is a greater need, above and beyond our existing one, for Nigeria’s workforce to be technologically educated, trained, and upskilled. Failure to do so will be devastating as our country and businesses be quickly left behind in today’s highly competitive global economy.
