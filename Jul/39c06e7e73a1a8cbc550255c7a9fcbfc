Scores of less-privileges comprises of physically challenged people, widows, widowers and aged people have been empowered by Olu Block Foundation in Ota, Ogun State. The event was part of activities to remember Evangelist Festus Fayomi, who started the humanitarian services 10 years ago. Speaking at the event, the Chairman of the foundation, Otunba Ibrahim Fayomi, said: “Olu Block Foundation came as a legacy left behind by our father, Fayomi, who during his lifetime was supportive of the indigent members of his community to the extent that after his demise some were still coming around for the purpose of getting his usual relief packages. “I was motivated to reactivate the programme with proper coordination and requisite legal framework,” Fayomi said. Ogun State House of Assembly Majority Leader Sheriff Yusuf, who represented Senator Olamilekan Adeola, as the chief launcher, hailed the foundation for its welfare support. He said: “I learnt the support given by the foundation is done on a monthly basis, I’m motivated to make my own contributions to such a noble cause for the good of the needy in our midst.” Onimupin of Mupin Oba Yaya Kelani, said: ”This is a godly initiative that is already impacting the lives of the needy in our midst, with this step taken to formally launch the foundation, it is obvious that more indigent people will find comfort and help through the foundation.”
