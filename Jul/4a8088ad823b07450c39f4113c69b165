A Federal High Court in Lagos, Wednesday sentenced a father of three, Emmanuel Olatunji, to 15 years Imprisonment for unlawfully dealing in 2.10 kilogrammes of Cannabis Sativa popularly called Indian Hemp. Olatunji’s conviction followed his “guilty” plea last month to a two-count charge preferred against him by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). Justice Tijjani Garuba Ringim convicted the defendant after reviewing the NDLEA’s case and exhibits tendered against Olatunji, including a certificate of test analysis; packing of substance form; a large brown envelope housing sample of the band weed; drug analysis report; the convict’s two comfessional statements and bulk of the seized banned weed. According to the agency, the offence contravened Section 11(c) and 19 of the NDLEA Act, 2004. But the convict’s counsel, Oke Ojakovo, made an allocutus praying the court to tamper justice with mercy, saying Olatunji had become remorseful since he was arrested and had promised not to return to crime. Mr Ojakovo told the court that the convict was an orphan with three kids, and the sole breadwinner of the family.
Justice Ringim sentenced Olatunji to five years on count one and 15 years on count two. The sentences are to run concurrently. The judge, however, gave the convict an option of N120,000 fine, in lieu of the jail term. The judge also directed the NDLEA to destroy the seized drug by burning it.
