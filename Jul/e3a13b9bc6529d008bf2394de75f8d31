THE Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) has been admonished to do everything humanly possible to conduct free, fair and credible local government elections this month. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State should also endeavour to give the Electoral body free hands to do its job without any interference or pressure. This admonition was given by a renowned Lagos based socio-political activist and critic, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, in a press statement in Lagos. According to Onitiri, this month’s local government elections would showcase how 2023 elections will run. “Lagosians will want their votes to count and are desirous to vote for the candidates of their choice into the various councils. In the interest of peace, the elections must be credible, free and fair. Lagos State should serve as a pacesetter for other states of the Federation to follow,” Onitiri stated. The social critic warned that Lagosians could not afford any political crises now; hence all hands must be on deck to ensure hitch-free polls for the new council administrations this month. According to Onitiri, Nigerians are angry presently and any little provocation could bring this nation on the precipice. “Let us give peace a chance and let the votes of the people count,” the socio-political activist stressed.
