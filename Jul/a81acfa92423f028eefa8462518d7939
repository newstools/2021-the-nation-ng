The umbrella body of Ijaw Youths, the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide, has thrown its weight behind the position of Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri that the federal government should return the revoked Atala Oil Marginal Field (OML 46) to the state.The licence was revoked by the federal government through the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in April 2020. Diri had on Wednesday reacted publicly to the revocation for the first time amid the controversies it had generated in recent times. The governor had expressed shock over the revocation of the oil field, saying the marginal oil field remained the stateâ€™s prized asset to which it was sentimentally attached and urged the Federal Government to reconsider its decision on the matter. But the IYC through its National Spokesman, Comrade Ebilade Ekerefe, said on Friday there was the urgent need for the DPR, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, to consider returning the oil field to the state under the doctrine of first refusal. According to him, the Bayelsa State government which is the rightful owner of the Atala Oil Marginal Field (OML 46) should have been granted the right of first refusal before it was revoked and re-awarded. He called on the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, to assist his state of origin to secure back its prized asset for the peace and development of the state and the Niger Delta region.
