After watching closely the Euro 2020 Championship, Coach Gernot Rohr said he would be pleased to see the Super Eagles star as a collective bunch irrespective of whether they are attacking or defending. The German said that both England and Italy who will play Sunday’s final match at the Wembley Stadium thrived because they were able to adopt different tactical systems to survive against some difficult oppositions along the way. “Each ambitious team today should be able to play in different systems,” noted the 68-year-old former Bayern Munich defender when pressed for some of the lessons picked from Euro 2020. “(teams)  defending and attacking together.” Meanwhile, Rohr who exclusively told NationSport on Tuesday that Italy  and England will respectively prevailed against Spain and Denmark in the semi-finals, has again hinted that the final match of the Euro 2020 is too close to call. “Of course, England is favourite at home,” Rohr who also stars for Bordeaux in his heyday told NationSport. They are a complete team, physically and tactically on the top. The fans are a big support, but I regretted their attitude to whistle the opponents, even the national anthem.” He added: “I think that Italy can be a winning outsider, solid block-playing with fast counterattacks. “Both teams can play with three or four in the defense. A lot of teams now have a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 organization, evolution, defending, and attacking together. “So, a nice final on Sunday,” Rohr noted.
