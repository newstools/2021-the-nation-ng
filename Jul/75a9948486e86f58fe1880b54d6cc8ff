The House of Representatives went into another rowdy session on Friday as it resumed consideration of the Electoral Act amendment bill. The House had suspended plenary and consideration of the bill following disagreement among members on the mode of transmitting election results on Thursday. It invited the Nigeria Communication Commission(NCC) to educate members on the implications and possibility of electronic transmission of results. Shortly after officials of the NCC left the chamber, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila announced resumption of consideration of the report after digesting the comments of the NCC officials begining from Clause 52. However, Deputy Speaker Idris Wase, who presided over consideration of reports, skipped clause 52, forcing Deputy Minority Leader, Hon Toby Okechukwu to call for a point of order. He drew the attention of the House to the fact that the issue in contention before consideration was suspended was the amendment to clause 52 and not the entire clause. He said recommendation of the Electoral Committee, which leaves the mode of transmission at the discretion of INEC was not voted on neither was a decision taken on the motion by Hon Kingsley Chinda. But when Wase said there was no motion to that effect, the House became rowdy and some members were seen charging at one another, spoiling for a fight. Details shortlyâ€¦
