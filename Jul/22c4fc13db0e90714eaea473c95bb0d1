A Jos Upper Area Court 3 sitting in Kasuwan Nama on Tuesday dissolved the 20-year-old marriage between one Karimatu Lawal ( the petitioner) and her husband, Bashiru Sani over lack of trust and maltreatment. The Judge, Suleiman Lawal, granted the divorce to the couple as all efforts to reconcile them failed. Suleiman ordered the petitioner and the respondent to go their separate ways. He also granted the petitioner custody of her last two children and asked the respondent to be responsible for their welfare. Earlier before the divorce was granted, the petitioner had told the court that the respondent no longer trusted her and that he was fond of abusing her at home in the presence of their children and in public. She said that Sani had no respect for any of her siblings and was ill-mannered toward her. She added that he was not living up to his responsibilities in terms of welfare of the children and the house in general. Lawal told the court that the respondent forced her to rent an apartment as he could no longer accommodate her. She said that she had been living in bondage for the last 20 years because of the respondentâ€™s attitude toward her in the house. Lawal said that because of the respondents intolerable behaviour toward her and her five children, she lacked total love for the respondent, adding that it was why she was in court to seek the dissolution of the marriage.
