 Policemen of the Edo State command yesterday rescued six kidnap victims along Benin-Ekpoma Road. Two suspected criminals were also apprehended during the operation, police spokesman Bello Kottongs said in a statement yesterday. He said: “Operatives of Edo State Police Command, Egba Divisional Headquarters, acting on credible information from members of the public that a Toyota Sienna bus with registration number Edo RRU 780 NE driven by Eric Ehiaguna belonging to a private transport company, coming from Ekpoma to Benin City, was intercepted by hoodlums suspected to be kidnappers at Igue-Ozevbaru and kidnapped all the occupants, forcing them into the forest. “The DPO Egba Division, John Emmanuel mobilised his patrol teams, Safer Highway, military and vigilance groups into the bush for immediate bush-combing, with a view to ensuring the safe rescue of the kidnapped victims.  “The police operatives’ team swooped on the kidnappers, while leading the victims into the thick forest. The security operatives engaged the hoodlums in a gun duel around Obadan forest. The hoodlums then abandoned all the six kidnapped victims, including the driver, Eric Ehiaguna, and fled into the bush. “Two of the kidnappers Abdulkarim Kazeem, 40, and Odoh Chukchekua, also 40, were arrested in the process, while others escaped. The command warns criminal elements in Edo State to repent or relocate from the state or risk being arrested and made to face the full wrath of the law.” Kottongs also pleaded with residents of the state to go about their lawful businesses without fear of intimidation or molestation.
