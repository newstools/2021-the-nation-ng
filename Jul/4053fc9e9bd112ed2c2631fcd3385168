Nollywood actress, Dayo Amusa has called out colleague, Yomi Fabiyi over his recent alleged controversial movie, ‘Oko Iyabo’. Amusa, in a Facebook post, noted that the step taken by Fabiyi is uncalled for, urging the Censors board and TAMPAN to do the needful. Amusa said although she has kept quiet about the ongoing issue between Yomi Fabiyi and Iyabo Ojo over the alleged sexual assault by Baba Ijesha but making a movie out of it is extreme. “In as much as I choose not to speak openly about the ongoings but there are issues one must not keep quiet about. Seeing a video of a movie by Yomi Fabiyi today has proved how much of a shame and insensitive he is,” said Dayo Amusa. “You even have the effrontery to share the movie link with me on WhatsApp, I don’t judge people as I believe we all see things and react to situations differently but Under no circumstances should someone’s pain and tribulation be turned into a thing of mockery. “Yomi just proved how much he lacks empathy. To what extent if I may ask, TAMPAN, Censors Boards and the court of law shouldn’t shy away from this. Ilu ti o sofin ni ko si ese. I am disappointed.”
