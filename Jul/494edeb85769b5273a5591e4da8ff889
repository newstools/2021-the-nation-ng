A Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court at Maitama in Abuja on Monday admitted a former Surveyor-General of the Federation, Ebisintei Awudu, to N100 million bail. The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) arraigned Awudu before Justice Olusegun Adeniyi on a 22-count charge of fraud. Ruling in the application, the judge also ordered Awudu to produce a surety in like sum, who must be a director-general or a permanent secretary. Adeniyi adjourned the matter till September 13 for trial. The ICPC alleged that Awudu awarded multiple contracts worth over N2 billion to a company in which he was a director and shareholder as well as to relations and associates. The anti-graft agency also alleged that he received over N300 million as gratification from a contractor handling and executing different contracts for the office of surveyor-general of the federation. This, ICPC said, was an offence, contrary to Section (10) (a) (i) and punishable under Section 10 (a) (ii) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2000. Awudu pleaded not guilty to all counts. His counsel, F. B. Olorogun, prayed the court to grant bail to his client.
