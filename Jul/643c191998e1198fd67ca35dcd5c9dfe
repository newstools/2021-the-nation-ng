LIVERPOOL’S summer signing Ibrahima Konate has aimed to give fans a confidence boost heading into the new season by insisting he can impress in the Reds’ defence. Konate joined Liverpool for just £36million in the summer after they triggered his release clause at RB Leipzig as Jurgen Klopp’s men look to put a traumatic 2020-21 campaign behind them. Entering that season as defending Premier League champions, Liverpool’s campaign soon spiralled out of control once their two main centre-backs in Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez were ruled out for the rest of the season, and a third in Joel Matip was also sidelined long term. Eventually sneaking a Champions League place in the final couple of games of the season with a third place finish, the Reds will now hope to challenge for the Premier League title once again. Konate arrives at the club likely to partner Van Dijk at the back and was keen to inform supporters of the strengths he will look to bring to the red side of Merseyside.  “I am big, I am strong and I am not scared with the ball,” he told Liverpool’s website. “I can score more with my foot than my head, it is a little bit strange! This is me! “Yes, I have this quality, but I have to work again and again and more and more and more for being a very good defender. “I have watched some Premier League games and everybody knows there is so much intensity, strong players. This is difficult but I [will] love the challenge.” The 22-year-old will take the No 5 vacated by Georginio Wijnaldum following his move to Paris Saint-Germain after the expiry of his Liverpool deal, and he can be sure he will be referred to by his nickname ‘Ibou’.
