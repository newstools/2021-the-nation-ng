ABUJA based gospel artiste, Agbani Horsfall, has revealed that her music exhibits her deep love and affection for God. “My music exhibits the deep love and affection I have for God who remains steadfast to us. I always express it in my music and also be a medium through which God speaks to people. There’s too much noise in the world about vulgar things, all mostly expressed in music and dance. If the things of God should be heard, music ministers need to do more,” she said. Horsfall, who is set to launch her virtual song release entitled, ‘Holy Spirit’ on Sunday, July 25, said she spends more time in her prayer room whenever she’s inspired to release an album. “The way I feel every time I want to release a new song is by spending more time in my prayer room, seeking God to move mightily as the world hears this song and let His presence be felt. Let lives be changed and Let God alone take the glory,” Horsfall said. The multi-talented artiste disclosed that the virtual launch is an opportunity for her fans to Meet and Greet with Agbani Horsfall. She recalls that last year, she released her virtual debut album, Spirit of The Living God with tracks like King of Kings, Belongs to You, Kiniyanabo, Love of My Life, Belema (Love), Same God, and Celebrate (a Christmas song) with various genres of music. Talking about one of her songs, Ahurum-gi-nanya, she says it is about the Holy Spirit, her love for God and the way He loves and has blessed her. Speaking further she believes the role of a gospel artist is to provide a way for people to maintain balance in their lives through their songs. Agbani further stated that the messages in her songs have always been about salvation and love.
