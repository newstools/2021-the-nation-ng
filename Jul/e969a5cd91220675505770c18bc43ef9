Ondo Police Command has confirmed three persons dead after robbers attacked a bank at Ilara Mokin, Ifedore local government area. Among the dead were a policeman, a commercial motorcyclist and a staff of the Elizade University identified as Bunmi Afuye. Spokesman for Ondo Police Command, Tee-Leo Ikoro, spoke after he paid an on-the-spot assessment of the scene. Ikoro said investigation has commenced into the incident. Three other persons who were hit by strayed bullets were rushed to a hospital. Witnesses said the robbers carted away some money. The witnesses said the robbers gained access into the bank by destroying the bullet-proof door with dynamites. It was gathered the Okada rider and Elizade university staff were passing by when they rammed into the robbery operation and were shot dead. One of the customers inside the bank when the robbers struck said they were about six and started the operation by 3pm. He said: “I was inside the bank when they (robbers) came, immediately all of us laid down, they started shouting where is the manager! Where is the manager? “So they later got the key of the vault and packed the money there but they were not satisfied with what they saw. They also opened the Automated Teller Machine but there was not enough money. “That infuriated them and they shouted where is the money? It seems they didn’t get their target. After they took the money they went out angrily shooting to escape the scene.”
