The rift between former besties, Bobrisky and Tonto Dikeh has taken a new dimension with both parties throwing shades at each other. The crossdresser took out time to call out his former best friend for allegedly owing a debt of five million Naira. Bobrisky who took to social media to shade Tonto Dikeh also queried the actress’s faith alleging that she smokes marijuana. “Some people are born wicked, how can you owe me five million naira and still throw shade at me. Naa don’t cross the line aunty, keep living your fake life, I don’t care,” he wrote. Earlier in the day, Dikeh had shared a daily motivational speech on Instagram which offended Bobrisky, who believed the message was directed towards him. The crossdresser responded to the message saying, “Lmao jealous? How biko? Aunty pay your debt. You dey owe person, you are still fighting the person. Fear God Aunty born again wey dey smoke Igbo (sk) for a corner. If they born you well come for me, I bet my life you can’t because you know I’m the boss. I will teach you how to throw heavy shade. I go learn that one for school. Five million no be beans oh! I get a receipt. Who can borrow a friend up to five million these days.” Up until 2020, Tonto Dikeh shared a cordial bond with Bobrisky. They have traveled to several countries together, flaunting it on social media.
