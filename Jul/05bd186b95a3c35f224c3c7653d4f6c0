 Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde and Senate Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu have expressed sadness over the death of multi-talented singer and producer, Olanrewaju Abdul-Ganiu Fasasi (Sound Sultan). The singer died yesterday in the United States of America (U.S.A) after battling with Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell lymphoma, a rare white blood cell cancer. He was 44. The governor described the singer’s death as a huge loss to the state and the entertainment world. He commiserated with the immediate family of the artiste, Iseyin community in Oyo State and the entertainment industry on what he called the demise of a truly great ambassador of the state.  A statement by his Special Assistant (Print Media), Moses Alao, quoted Makinde as saying that Oyo State lost in Sound Sultan “a humble, unassuming but truly great talent and a shining light who has positively impacted the society with his act”. The governor urged youths in the state to borrow a leaf from the pages of Sound Sultan’s books, as, according to him, the late singer showed great example on how to manage fame as a young person. In his condolence message yesterday in Abuja, Kalu said: “…The deceased was a talented song writer, recording artiste, rapper, comedian and actor. “He was blessed with various skills. “The deceased carved a niche for himself in the music industry as a talented artiste. “His demise is a huge loss to the entertainment industry and Nigeria in general.”
