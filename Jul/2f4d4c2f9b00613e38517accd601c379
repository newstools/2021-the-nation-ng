The enforcement team of Lagos State Water Regulatory Commission (LASWARCO) has sealed 30 factories for infractions, ranging from unhygienic production environment, failure to comply with regulatory provisions, and non-adherence to good manufacturing practice. Executive Secretary of LASWARCO Mrs. Funke Adepoju said the enforcement was in line with the commission’s mandate to protect residents from consuming unhygienic water. She added that the exercise would be sustained. She said: “In as much as we have the mandate to ensure that operators remain in business, we also cannot allow infractions to fester without being addressed. The primary regulatory mandate of the commission is to ensure that operators in the water abstraction, production and distribution industry comply with best manufacturing procedures to safeguard the health of the people. “The enforcement team visited some factories with on-site testing kits and the result confirmed that most of them were operating far below safety parameters. As the regulatory body empowered by Section 313 (H) of Lagos State Environmental Management Protection Law, 2017, to regulate activities of those engaged in the provision, consumption, treatment, packaging, sales and supply of drinking water contained in bottles or polythene bags, our principal interest is to ensure acceptable standards.” Adepoju said the factories would remain sealed until their owners comply with all safety procedures and register for further monitoring to facilitate compliance with best practice. She also urged residents to report any water production factory suspected to be involved in unwholesome practice, saying LASWARCO would ward off any attempt to put  residents’ life in jeopardy.
