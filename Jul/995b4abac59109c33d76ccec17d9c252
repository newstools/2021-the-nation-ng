Music superstar Davido has dropped the video for ‘Shopping Spree’ off his ‘A better time’ album released in November 2021. The award-winning singer had dropped a teaser of about 20 seconds via his Instagram page on Thursday, the July 15, 2021 as he also revealed the video for ‘Shopping Spree’ will be released the next day. ‘Shopping Spree’ is one of the songs of Davido’s latest album, ‘A Better Time’ with video directed by Ges Gray and produced by Foreign Made Films. The song features American artists, Chris Brown and Young Thug. This is however not the first time Davido is working with either artist. Davido worked with Young Thug and Rae Sremmurd on his 2017 single ‘Pere’. He also has a well-documented relationship with Chris Brown. He featured the singer on his previous album ‘A good time’ on the song ‘Blow my mind’. Chris Brown returned the favour by featuring the DMW boss on ‘Lower Body’, a song off the extended cut of his ‘Indigo’ album years ago. Posting an excerpt from his latest project, the “Fem” crooner wrote:” Shopping video spree video out now worldwide!!! Called my brothers for a vibe! @chrisbrownofficial @thuggerthugger1.” ‘Shopping Spree’ video has gathered over 100,000 views since its upload and is expected to gather even more views before the end of today and in the days to come.
