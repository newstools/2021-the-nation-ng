A councillorship aspirant in the Ogun State local government elections, Muyiwa Osularu, has sued the Vice Chairman, Caretaker Committee of Ikenne Local Government Area (LGA), Muhammed Efuwape, for allegedly substituting his name with that of another person. The suit, filed at the Sagamu High Court through his lawyers, Fazaz  Daud and Hussein Omikunle, comes less than two weeks to July 24 poll. Joined as second and third defendants in the suit are the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC). Osularu, in his July 8 originating summons, is seeking an order compelling the respondents to appear before the court within seven days of being served by the plaintiff. He is praying the court to determine among other things whether, according to the Electoral Act 2010, the APC constitution and election guidelines, it was lawful that his name should have been substituted with Efuwape’s as the APC councillorship candidate for Ward 5, Iperu Remo. The applicant is also praying the court to nullify Efuwape as the APC councillorship candidate. He prayed the court to order the APC to forward his name to OGSIEC while OGSIEC must accept, list, publicize and print his name on the ballot paper as the APC councillorship candidate in the election. The applicant is also asking the court for an order of perpetual injunction restraining Efuwape from parading himself as the standard bearer of APC for Ward 5 candidate in the coming local government elections while the party and OGSIEC must also henceforth stop dealing with him as far as this subject matter is concerned.
