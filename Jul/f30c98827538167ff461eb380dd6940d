Kwara State Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi has urged churches and other religious organisations to always pray for Nigeria to overcome its current challenges. The deputy governor attributed the country’s myriad of challenges to the negative mindset of many Nigerians towards their fatherland. Alabi said this in Oke-Onigbin, Isin Local Government Area, at a funeral service  of Deaconess Felicia Ajibola Fadipe. He said: “The church has a role to play in getting the country out of the current quagmire. I challenge all men of God to pray for our nation. There is nothing prayer cannot do. “The only way we can have peace, progress and tranquility is for all of us to review our mindset. With this, Nigeria will become a better place for all.” During his sermon, one of the officiating ministers, Venerable Julius Abejide, said the craze for materialism and primitive accumulation of wealth is leading the country to the precipice. He added that the penchant to outwit the other person and selfishness have preoccupied the minds of the vast majority of Nigerians. Venerable Abejide said “Nigeria is in this mess because we have all become exploiters. What are we building a nation for? If any of us is asked today to give answer to his question,  we will not be able to give. “Rather we live our lives to impress others instead of honouring God. “God is not asking you as a leader to conquer the world. He is asking us to be honest and trustworthy with our time and resources. Both leader and the led are to use their time and resources for the betterment of humanity.” The clergyman added that God would judge everyone according to his deeds in the hereafter. The deceased is survived by children and grandchildren, including Timothy Fadipe, the current Transition Implementation Committee chair, Isin local government area and Dr. Olugbenga Fadipe, a director at the Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja.
