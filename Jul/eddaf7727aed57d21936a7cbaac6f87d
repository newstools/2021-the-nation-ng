THE finals of Euro 2020 and the Copa America take place Sunday and Manchester United have four players in the hunt for a trophy. But the one player Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer singled out was Brazil’s Fred, who deserved immense credit for getting fit in time to help his country reach the Copa America final. The boss spoke about how Fred picked up an injury in our last league game of the season, and only came on as a substitute against Villarreal in Gdansk. It has impressed him how the midfielder got his head down and worked really hard to get his fitness in check.  It’s clear Fred’s performances for Brazil have caught an eye at Carrington. “I have to put particular praise to Fred,” Solskjaer told the official Manchester United website, in his first interview of the pre-season, when he also spoke about the arrival of Tom Heaton and contract extensions given to Juan Mata and Lee Grant.
