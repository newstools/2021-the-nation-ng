Kogi Governor Yahaya Bello has said he would answer those asking him to run for presidency in 2023 at an appropriate time. He said this on Saturday at the Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB) seminar for crime and political reporters in Abuja. Bello, who was responding to a question seeking clarification on his political ambition ahead of the 2023 general elections, refused to be categorical but assured he would give an appropriate reply at the appropriate time. According to him, Nigerians were seeking solutions to the nation’s problems, issues he claimed his team effectively resolved in Kogi State. He said: “Considering the way and manner I became the Governor of Kogi State-very nouvelle at all time, I am always mindful of that. So far so good, we have heard about very few of our numerous achievements in Kogi State from the officials and even from the foreigners. “People continue to ask questions how come Kogi state has achieved these much, probably they reported less? Thank God you have witnessed all of these. “When you gather quality, capacity and mix them together, this is the result you have. In summary, unity, security and economic prosperity. “Nigerians are out there searching for the solution to Nigeria’s problem. I will simply say at the appropriate time, I will give an appropriate answer. “I know surely that if we can achieve this in Kogi state, we can achieve more in Nigeria if and when the time comes.”
