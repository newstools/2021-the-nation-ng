The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has granted emergency use authorisation for three COVID-19 vaccines – Moderna, AstraZeneca (from Korea) and Sputnik V. The AstraZeneca approved is from Korea due to the stall in the procurement of AstraZeneca vaccine also known as Covishield, manufactured under licence by Serum Institute of India due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The NAFDAC had previously approved AstraZeneca (India), Pfizer bioNTech and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, in February and May 2021, respectively. The Director-General of the NAFDAC, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye, announced this at its headquarters in Abuja on Thursday. She explained the agency’s vaccine committee expedited the review of the vaccines based on emergency use listing (EUL) given by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or approval by stringent regulatory countries. She further stated the agency, while reviewing the vaccines have gone through quality, safety and efficacy evaluations, and the benefits far exceeds the risks. The NAFDAC boss disclosed the emergency use listing will allow Nigeria receive vaccines from COVAX facility. It uses a track-and-trace or traceability system to prevent fake vaccines from infiltrating the system and stall the divergence of vaccines across the country. Details shortly….
