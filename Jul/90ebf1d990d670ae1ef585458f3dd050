Senate Committee Chairman on Media and Public Affairs Surajudeen Ajibola Basiru challenged the media “to point out sections of the bills and how they will adversely affect free media” Reacting to the advertisement published by newspapers on Monday on the media Bill, Basiru said: “It does not just suffice to come up with graphics and try to do scaremongering. They (media) have not demonstrated empirically how the bills would gag information in Nigeria. “Democracy is a market of ideas. So anybody that has a contrary view should express it in a way to convince other people as to the rightness of his own position. “If they want to canvass against the legislation, they should come up with a concrete argument pointing out relevant obnoxious provisions, if any, and the reasons why they are obnoxious. “You cannot just make a banner graphics and say that is the basis to engage a national legislature. At the best, it is just emotional blackmail.”
