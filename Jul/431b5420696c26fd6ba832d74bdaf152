ITALY midfielder Marco Verratti said beating England at Wembley in the Euro 2020 final tomorrow would be a dream, insisting his side go into the match with no fear. England booked their first European Championship final spot with a 2-1 extra-time victory over Denmark at Wembley on Wednesday and now face the Azzurri who beat Spain on penalties at the same stadium on Tuesday. Gareth Southgate’s England side have won 15 of their last 17 matches at Wembley in all competitions, scoring 46 goals and conceding five, but that record does not faze Verratti. “We saw the match (against Denmark) together,” he told a news conference. “England are strong and they have players who are also technically good. “They deserve to be in this final in a stadium they know well. It would be a dream to be able to win it like this in their stadium. “We are used to playing in stadiums like this, it will give us strength too. We are not afraid. We are happy that they won, now we are both playing in a historic final.” Italy are familiar with Wembley having also beaten Austria after extra time in their last 16 match at the stadium before ousting top-ranked Belgium in Munich and then the Spaniards.
