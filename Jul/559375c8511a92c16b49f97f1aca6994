However, it was learned that his driver, who sustained gunshot injuries, was taken to hospital, where doctors have been battling to save his life. His official vehicle, which was riddled with bullets, was in the gutter, the driver having lost controlÂ of the vehicle. It was not clear who the killers were or why they eliminated him.
