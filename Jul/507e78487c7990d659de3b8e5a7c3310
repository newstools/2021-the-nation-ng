Competitive interschool sports are a good way to build character, sportsmanship, and teamwork of Nigerian youth and give them the opportunity to develop their skills at the highest level of endeavors. The CEO of Hogan Guards Security Limited,  Paul Ibirogba stated this at the award presentation to the winners of a youth football tournament for primary schools in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State. The security expert noted that Nigeria should see youth sports beyond the health and fitness benefits as the country had a lot to gain in this effort. The competition which was won by St. Matthew Anglican Primary School, Ijebu Ode was sponsored by Hogan Guards as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility towards the company’s 40th  anniversary coming up later in the year. The company also renovated Moslem Primary School, Ijebu Ode which hosted the competition and donated athletic and educational items to all the schools that participated in the football contest. Ibirogba said the renovation was meant to reinforce the security of the school in view of the current spate of insecurity in the country: “Securing school premises should be a top priority for all concerned given the state of insecurity around the nation.” The championship trophy was presented to St. Matthew Anglican Primary School by Dr. Adetunji Dawodu, the chairman of Alphagate College of Health Technology, Ijebu Ode and Pioneer Provost of Ogun State College of Health Technology, while Brigadier General Abiodun Quadri (retd), presented gifts to the youth referees on behalf of Hogan Guards.
