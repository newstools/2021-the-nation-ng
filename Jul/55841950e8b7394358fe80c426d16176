THE man dubbed ‘the world’s richest ref’, Bjorn Kuipers, will take charge of England’s Euro 2020 final against Italy on Sunday, UEFA have confirmed. The Three Lions continued their momentous journey at the tournament on Wednesday night – beating Denmark 2-1 in extra time after a nail-biting semi-final at Wembley, with Gareth Southgate’s men marching on to their first ever European Championships showpiece. And the Dutch referee, who was reported to be worth around £11.5million in 2016, will be the man in the middle. Kuipers co-founded supermarket chain Jumbo Kuipers in the Netherlands having earned a degree in business administration from the Radboud University in Nijmegen. The Dutch chain even sponsors Formula One star Max Verstappen and Kuipers has enough money in the bank to comfortably retire. But he relishes the chance to officiate huge matches and they don’t come much bigger than Sunday night. It is set to be a momentous occasion and a fierce contest between both sides as they battle it out to become champions of Europe, and Kuipers will be tasked with conducting affairs in what will be his seventh UEFA final. He will be assisted in his team by fellow Dutchmen Sander van Roekel and Erwin Zeinstra, with Spaniard Carlos Del Cerro Grande as the fourth official and German Bastian Dankert as the video assistant referee (VAR).
