What the numbers are showing us is that we have to be very careful that we don’t go all out and mingle in crowds, and refuse to take those public health measures. “If we do that, it means that we are welcoming a third wave. Similar situation occurred in India. Part of the reasons they witnessed a third wave was because of the festivities in India – a lot of traveling and crowding. We can learn from India.”
