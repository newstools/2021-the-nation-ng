 Ogun State government yesterday stated that the state has recorded two deaths in the last three weeks from COVID – 19 and 15 new cases within two weeks. Commissioner for Health  Dr. Tomi  Coker, who stated this in a statement, said Ogun State has experienced gradual rise in COVID – 19 new cases within the said period compared to two cases witnessed in the whole month of June. According to her,  four persons are currently being managed in the isolation centre that hitherto was empty in the last one month. She noted that given that many lands cross one another, and the fact that eight of  local government areas (LGAs) in the state share boarder with Lagos State with a major international airport and the highly mobile community between them, it becomes pertinent for Ogun State government to proactively curtail the spread of COVID-19 virus among the people.  “While NCDC is currently working frantically to ensure surveillance of the variants in the country, Ogun State Government is re-energising her response team at State and LGA level for prompt and effective response. Risk communication is being embarked upon at community level through the LGA rapid response team. She said : “We are working with the Federal Port Health Authority to ensure passengers are screened at the land crossings in the State.  Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) focal persons in our health facilities have been alerted to step up IPC measures while we have deployed Rapid test Kits to major secondary and tertiary Health facilities to test patients who are to undergo surgeries, patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID 19 and persons who want to know their status. “We are also embarking on mobilisation for test at our five-high burdened LGAs (Abeokuta South, Ado-Odo/Ota, Ikenne, Obafemi Owode and Sagamu). “We urge all Ogun State residents to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place.”
