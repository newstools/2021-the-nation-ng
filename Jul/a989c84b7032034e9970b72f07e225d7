GOtv Boxing Night stalwart Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde is optimistic about knocking out Dymtro Mytrovanov when the two welterweight prospects clash later in the month. Babatunde, who holds the World Boxing Federation (WBF) Intercontinental Welterweight belt, will face his Ukrainian challenger on July 17 at Eguides Club, Kiev for the World Boxing Organisation (WBO) Oriental Middleweight title. Since his discovery at the inaugural edition of GOtv Boxing NextGen Search in 2016, Baby Face has enjoyed a meteoric rise in his professional career during which he has remained undefeated against local and international opponents and a win against the 31-year-old undefeated Ukrainian will cement his profile as one of the rising stars in the welterweight division. The 25-year-old remains undefeated in 13 fights with eight knockouts and has won the national, West African Boxing Union, and WBF Intercontinental welterweight titles since bursting on the scene. Babatunde knocked out Tanzania’s Salehe Mkalekwa in the 12th round to claim the vacant WBF title at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos in April. “I have nothing to fear. I am preparing well and I am confident of defeating Mytrovanov,” A confident Babatunde disclosed. “It doesn’t matter that the fight is being held in Ukraine. A fifth-round knockout is what my opponent should expect.”
