The Super Eagles sojourn  in different cities will soon be over as soon  as rehabilitation work is completed  at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium Abuja and the National  Stadium,  Surulere,  Lagos. This assurance was made  by the Minister  of Youth and sports Development  Sunday Dare when he visited the training  camp of the Home- based Super Eagles in Abuja. “The national team is the pride of the nation, no national  team moves  from one city to another,” he said. “The Eagles deserve a permanent  home ground to give them a sense of belonging and  to maximize  the benefits  of playing at home  in a regular venue. “We are working  with the companies rehabilitating the Moshood Abiola National Stadium Abuja and the  National Stadium, Surulere to expedite action to complete on going rehabilitation. Once the facilities  are ready, we will get the NFF to get FIFA certify  the stadiums  so that our teams can have permanent  playing grounds.” The Minister  asserted that his dream is to see the national teams have permanent  camp as was the case in the past instead of the ad-hoc  arrangements  of inviting players to train for only few days before matches. The Super Eagles  have been forced  to move from one venue to another due to the poor  states of the two national  stadiums in Abuja and Lagos.
