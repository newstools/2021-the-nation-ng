CrossPoint Innovate, a training, mentorship and empowerment platform, is organising a conference and pitch worth N8 million in grants. The conference, which will hold on August 7, 2021 at Newcastle Hotel,  Lekki, Lagos, is focused on helping youths and owners of small businesses to start and grow their businesses. It also aims to celebrate and highlight businesses, which stand-out, while inspiring the next generation on leadership, finance and service delivery. Founder of CrossPoint Innovate and Pastor of CrossPoint Church, Ladipo Soyombo, said: “We came up with CrossPoint Innovate when the country was experiencing a recession. Many people had lost their jobs and those who owned businesses were struggling. What we, then, did was to start an online training for young people, which saw some success earlier this year. We took it one step further with the conference and pitch competition, and already, hundreds of people have applied.” Soyombo said the sheer number of people who have applied for the contest is a reflection of not only the entreprenuerial spirit of Nigerians, but also the gap, in funding and support for small businesses. He added: “The funding gap is huge, and Crosspoint Innovate wants to do its part in giving businesses a fighting chance.”
