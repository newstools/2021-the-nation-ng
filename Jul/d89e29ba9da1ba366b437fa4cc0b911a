The Ibile Microfinance Bank, Lagos, has called for investment in the education and empowerment of children of from indigent backgrounds so that they will not continue to be a social menace in the society. Head of Audit and Compliance, Ibile MFB, Mr Paul Olaoye, said this while presenting money and other items to 18-year-old Goodness Musa and her amputee mother, Joy, who lost four children and husband in a Boko haram attack in Plateau State. “If children of the indigents are not empowered or educated, they will become touts, armed robber and make life miserable for the privileged,” Olaoye said.  Explaining how the bank connected with the Musas, Olaoye said, “There was a programme held on radio and meant to advertise our products. She made a call after the programme requesting for a loan of N20,000.  She told us she needed it to set up her daughter in the natural drink business. She lost her husband, four children and leg to Boko Haram attack in Plateau state.  So we raised funds for her as part of our CSR.  We decided to raise more money, we gave her the things needed for the business, we bought food stuff and kept the remaining in the bank for her to come and withdraw when she decides on a vocation she wishes to learn. The mother cannot walk, so the daughter needs to help her. Head, Public sector, Mr. Rasheed Ajalaruru, said, “We will open an account for the girl as part of CSR. We also want to encourage the private sector to assist her and people in her shoes.” Mrs. Musa said she had been finding it difficult to train the only daughter she had left because of her amputated leg, in which she still feels excruciating pain. On her part, Goodness thanked the Bank for the gesture, saying it would assist her fend for herself and mother.
