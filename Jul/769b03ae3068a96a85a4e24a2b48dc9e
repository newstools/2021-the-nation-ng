Lagos State Sheep and Goat Butchers Association and its Ram Sellers counterpart have called on the state government to rescue them from members of the road transport operators, not Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), over illegal dues in Alaba Rago market. Butchers’ association’s state Treasurer Saka Akanji, said the transport union drove away officials of the accredited government revenue collector from the market, about two months ago. Akanji said: “The due is the epidemiology fee charged by the Ministry of Agriculture over every goat and sheep sold and slaughtered in the state, which we have been paying to the government approved collector and appropriate receipts are issued. But these union people without any affiliation to them came with force and started tasking our members to pay that money to them arbitrarily.”  Ram sellers Association Deputy Chairman Alhaji Hassan Abdulahi and General Secretary Oladunjoye Adebayo their members were not happy because they were been coerced to make those payments. Managing Director, Revman Best Nigeria Enterprises High Chief Olarewaju Bashorun, who claimed to be the approved government revenue collector, said: “I was given approval by the Lagos state Ministry of Agriculture to collect on its behalf, the epidemiology fee which we have been doing dutifully over the years until the brutal disruption by members of the transport union some weeks back.”
