They were shouting Sunday Igboho come out, we are DSS, we are soldiers, come out! “So I peeped through the window, and I saw them DSS uniform, and soldiers, so I was surprised because I didn’t kill anyone nor fight with anybody, what I’m doing is to fight for my people. “All the rally I’m doing is a peaceful rally, so I’m fighting for my family too because all the bandits killed my family, raped them kidnapped them and take ransom from them. “Government refused to do the right thing, that’s why I came out to support my family to fight for our right. So I was surprised. “Yes, I was in the house when they came. They killed about two guys. The shooting was too much. They destroyed all my properties, all my vehicles.”
