The Theatre Arts and Motion Pictures Practitioners Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN) has summoned one of its members Yomi Fabiyi for questioning over a newly released Yoruba movie titled: “Oko Iyabo”. The movie is based on Fabiyi’s colleagues, comedian Princess and Baba Ijesha’s sexual assault saga. It portrays Princess’s underage foster daughter as Baba Ijesha’s lover. It also depicts Baba Ijesha as a victim of a setup orchestrated by Princess. The characters in the film also take on the names of the individuals involved in the case including actress, Iyabo Ojo whom the story apparently centres around as they have been in a serious conflict of interest over the alleged sexual molestation by Baba Ijesha. In a letter dated July 5, 2021, signed by TAMPAN’s Deputy President, Conflict and Resolution Committee, Abiodun Olanrewaju to Yomi Fabiyi; the association said that it has received lots of complaints from the public and relative colleagues on the theme, title and content of a movie “OKO IYABO” produced and directed by Yomi Fabiyi and his co-director, Dele Mati, which is being streamed online by Oleku Television. The body said: “The controversy that the subject matter of the said film has generated is unbearable for us as an association. “The release of the film has sparked off another round of public dissension that may bring polemic against TAMPAN and our good members if we fail to nip it in the bud of the controversy. “For elucidation on the theme, title and content of the said movie, you are hereby invited for hearing by TAMPAN’s Conflict & Resolution Committee headed by Alhaji Tajudeen Olanrewaju with Barrister Femi Adebayo, Hafsat Balogun, Antar Laniyan, Fumbi Akinduro, Adewale Abdurasaq and Yemi Amodu as members.” “The hearing is scheduled for 11am on Thursday 8 July 2021 at Lagos TAMPAN House, 260 Agege Motor Road, Opposite Mayflower, Mushin Lagos State. “You are required to come along with a copy of the film. Thank you in anticipation for your punctuality.”
