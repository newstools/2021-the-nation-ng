Amir Khan has warned Anthony Joshua to “keep away from Tyson Fury ” after talks regarding an All-British fight collapsed. The two heavyweights have long been embroiled in a rivalry but are yet to square off in the ring. It looked as if the boxing world was finally going to get its wish as talks were held over a unification bout, but Fury was ordered to fight Deontay Wilder for a third time. It resulted in a huge backlash from Joshua’s camp who took aim at Fury and his team. The Gypsy King, who has battled problems in his personal life, beat Wilder in February 2020 and is seen as a genuine threat to Joshua, with many even giving him the upper hand. When discussing Joshua, Khan told the Last Stand Podcast: “He’s a beast, heavyweight champion. “But a lot of people say, ‘Is he gonna beat Tyson Fury?’ I think that could be one of the hardest fights he ever has. “If I was Anthony Joshua, I’d keep away from Tyson Fury.” Ed Hearn, Joshua’s promoter, has thrown the fight into doubt
