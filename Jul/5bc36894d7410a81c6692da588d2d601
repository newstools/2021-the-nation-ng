Nigeria’s leading security risk Company Halogen Group has sent a goodwill message to its adopted athlete to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Odunayo Adekuoroye. The women’s wrestling sensation, who has been ranked world’s number one in the 57kg category, is a two-time Commonwealth women’s wrestling champion with other multiple gold medals in several high profile global championships. Adekuoroye was last year adopted by Halogen Group under the Adopt-an-Athlete initiative designed by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development to produce champions for Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympic Games. In a goodwill message to the star wrester who has been named as Nigeria’s flag-bearer for the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics, Halogen praised Adekuoroye’s dedication, discipline and doggedness, adding such qualities would stand her in good stead for a podium finish in Tokyo. “Odunayo is an extraordinary athlete who creates huge excitement with her unbeatable performance in the wrestling ring,” the Halogen Group’s CEO Wale Olaoye noted. “She is the epitome of the Halogen brand with her boundless energy, passion for excellence, and uncommon commitment to superior performance, and she is influencing millions of Nigerian youths across the world to be great at what they do.”
