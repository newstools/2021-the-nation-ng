 The crisis rocking the Oyo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has taken another dimension as a faction opposed to the leadership of Governor Seyi Makinde opened a parallel party office in Ibadan. Those behind opening of the new secretariat claimed it was in preparation for the party’s congress coming up in a few weeks. But, the party’s Publicity Secretary, Akeem Olatunji, yesterday described the action of the faction’s members as a comedy. Some aggrieved PDP members were not happy over their perceived exclusion from the running of the party by the governor.  Oyo State PDP secretariat is originally located at Molete, Ibadan. But, the paralleled party secretariat has been opened at No. 2 Okunola Abass Street, Bodija Estate, Ibadan. Speaking with The Nation yesterday, PDP spokesman, Akeem Olatunji, stated that there is only one recognised PDP secretariat located at Molete, adding that those behind opening of the new party office are joking because it contravened the PDP constitution. He added that whoever that tried it shall face the wrath of the law.” Some aggrieved party members led by Hon. Mulikat Akande Adeola, Hon. Muraina Ajibola, Alhaji AbdulRasheed Adebisi Olopoeyan, Femi Babalola Jogor and others had convened a meeting of aggrieved party members from across the state to ‘salvage’ the party.
