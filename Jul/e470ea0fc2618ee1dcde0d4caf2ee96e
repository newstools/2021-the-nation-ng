The chairmanship candidate for Kosofe Local Government Area of Lagos State, Moyosore Ogunlewe, has rolled out a six-point development plan for the area. Ogunlewe, who is contesting on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), kicked off his campaign with a visit to traditional rulers in the council. His plan is hinged on the ‘Kosofe THEMES’. The lawyer-turned politician said his THEMES plan represents Traffic and Transport, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Kosofe a 21st Century Economy, Entertainment/Tourism, and Security and Governance. Ogunlewe said his administration would upgrade inner access roads to resolve regular bottlenecks in the council. He added: “Kosofe shall be the cleanest and healthiest council in the state, sanitary inspectors shall return and be strongly empowered to carry out regular inspections. “On making Kosofe a 21st Century Economy, we would begin the registration of businesses and certified/registered artisans within Kosofe. Every artisan in the council will have the opportunity to connect to businesses and industries.” The candidate also promised that his government will ‘promote the opening up of traditional/cultural festivals and celebrations where tourists and a vastly growing urban population can participate’.
