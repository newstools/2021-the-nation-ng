The minister remarked: “Your visit is timely and very important to the mandate of the ministry knowing fully well that Italy just won the Euro 2020 days ago. I watched the match and saw great football artistry displayed at the expense of the home team England. “ We will ensure that we take this relationship to the next level. Italy is renowned for football, basketball, and other sports. It is part of the clear mandate of the ministry to engage our youth through sports”. The bilateral relationship will focus on establishment and support of existing academies; Italy- Nigeria football tournaments; exchange of players; training of coaches, referees, kits, and equipment franchise. “Nigeria is a sports nation and we deem it fit to partner with the most populous black nation in the world,” noted Bellinato.“Just within one week, Nigeria defeated USA; the world number one in basketball and Argentina.”
