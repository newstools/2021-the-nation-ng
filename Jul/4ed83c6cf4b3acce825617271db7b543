Instagram has once again deleted controversial blogger Tunde Ednut’s account. The popular blogger has his verified account taken down twice and suspended within seven months. Ednut has been in a vigorous scuffle with Instagram after creating a second Instagram account early this year which eventually got suspended a few days after and now completely deleted. He created a backup Instagram account early this year in case of an eventuality. Following the recent removal of his verified Instagram page, the blogger took to his backup page to share a post which read; “Follow this backup and help REPOST. Thank you so much. While he urged his followers to invite others to follow his backup page as the caption read;
“Please invite others to follow this page @mufasatundeednut thanks!” In January 13, Tunde Ednut’s one million-strong follower account was removed by Instagram. This was after his previous Instagram page which was at 2.6 million followers was deleted in the early hours of Tuesday, December 22, 2020, by Instagram for spam. According to reports, the removal of his page off Instagram is said to be because of his streams of posts which allegedly bordered on degrading and body-shaming women, cyberbullying fellow celebrities, and engaging in spamming activities that went against Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram’s community guidelines. Sunday, 10th of January, he opened another account with the username, kingtundeednut, and as at early hours of Wednesday, he had gathered a million followers. To celebrate the impressive milestone, Tunde did a million Naira giveaway. However, it seemed Instagram had other plans as his account was again removed from the social media app a day after rewarding the winner of the giveaway.
