The Iredapo Community Development Association (CDA) in the Egan axis of Lagos State has boosted the health of residents through a medical outreach. The outreach included a seminar titled ‘Sex Education/Drug Abuse’, medical checks and distribution of medicines and condoms. Chairman of the association Dauda Shamsideen emphasised the importance of sound health, particularly in a populated community like Egan. He said it was important to constantly educate the people, especially on indiscriminate sex, birth control and drug abuse, which are most times fall outs of lack of education. He said: “This seminar is to enlighten us all, particularly the young ones, to stem the pressures that make sex/drug related vices rampant. We felt education should be the first step to reduce those acts. Since it is said that charity begins from the home, we deemed it proper to begin from our own community. “People need help; but they do not know how to get it. Depression and societal frustration most times force these youths to embrace drugs. Awareness is the key word. If they are aware of the dangers inherent, they would not get themselves involved in the first instance. That awareness is what we want to bring to all home.” Dr Olutosin Odekunle said: “We parents most times shirk in our responsibilities to our children, especially those in their teens. This stage of their life is the most crucial, particularly the girl-child whose innocence could be exploited.” Another speaker Dr Ayinla Funsho, a medical practitioner, spoke on what constitutes drug abuse, its effects and remedies, as well as birth control.
