Ogun State has recorded two deaths in the last three weeks from COVID-19 while 15 new cases have also been recorded within two weeks. Commissioner for Health Dr Tomi Coker who disclosed this in a statement, said Ogun has experienced gradual rise in COVID-19 new cases within the period compared to two cases witnessed in the whole month of June 2021. According to her, four persons are being managed in the isolation centre that hitherto was empty in the last one month. She noted given the fact that eight of local government areas share border with Lagos State with a major international airport and the highly mobile community between them, it becomes pertinent for Ogun state government to proactively curtail the spread of COVID-19 virus. “We are also embarking on mobilisation for test at our five-high burdened LGAs (Abeokuta South, Ado-Odo/Ota, Ikenne, Obafemi Owode and Sagamu). “We urge all Ogun State residents to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place. “Proven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. “We enjoin our community leaders, religious leaders, media houses and other stake holders to join hands with the State Government to encourage strict compliance to proper hand washing. “Regular and correct use of face mask, two meters physical distancing in public places and avoid crowded gatherings. “Let me also use this forum to encourage our people to avail themselves of the opportunity of getting vaccinated for COVID-19. “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease. “The Ogun State Ministry of Health is monitoring the trend and shall continue to update our esteemed residents from time to time.”
