VICTOR Moses has completed a permanent transfer to Spartak Moscow. The move brings to an end the wideman’s nine-year Chelsea career and returns him to the Russian Premier League club, where he made 20 appearances on loan last season. Moses switched Wigan Athletic for west London in the summer of 2012, completing his transfer to the European champions just days after starting against us on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. In his first interview as a Chelsea player, he promised ‘there’s still more to come from me’ and that is exactly what he then proved over the coming years. After making his Blues debut as a second-half substitute away at Queens Park Rangers, he then scored on his first start, capping a solid display by heading home to round off a 6-0 Carabao Cup victory over Wolves. A week later, he made his first Champions League appearance in another big win, this time in Denmark against Nordsjaelland. A promising maiden season proved to be the best goalscoring term of Moses’s time at Stamford Bridge, with further strikes against Swansea City, Leeds United and Shakhtar Donetsk coming before Christmas, the latter a last-minute European winner. They each gave him the opportunity to perform the acrobatic celebrations he became renowned for.
