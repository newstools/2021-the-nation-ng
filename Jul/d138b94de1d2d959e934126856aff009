The Rotary Club of Wuse Central has pledged to build a block of classrooms for pupils in Dogon Gada community in the FCT, provide boreholes and fix the toilet facilities. The club also pledged to fix the healthcare centre and clinic in a community in Jahi, a suburb in the FCT. The 23rd President of the Rotary Club of Wuse Central, Aluor Agusah said this during his investiture on Monday night in Abuja. He said the club, under his leadership for the next one year, will focus on three projects that will benefit residents of the identified communities in the FCT. Agusah said: “The club will deliver on those three projects: a primary school, healthcare centre and clinic in Jahi. The first one that goes to my heart is that of primary school. If you go there the students sit on the floor, they don’t have a toilet – they defecate in the bush. “The intervention we hope to in the primary school is to provide them with a block of classroom and see how we can fix, build toilets for them and provide them with a borehole. “There is no way a healthcare centre will be fully functional without a proper water system. We are going to provide that facility with water. “We will furnish the hospital in Jahi in such a way that residents in that area can benefit from the facility. The anti-natal section of the clinic has collapsed and we are going to put the infrastructure in place.”
