 Coach Paul Aigbogun and Enyimba forward Anayo Iwuala said they were proud of the home-based Super Eagles despite the 4-0 whacking by Mexico in an international friendly match played at the Los Angeles Coliseum Stadium in California, USA at the weekend. “It was a great experience for our team because Mexico is a high-level team and we had a lot of players making their debut, so it was a fantastic experience for them playing against this high quality side,” Aigbogun who stood in for German coach Gernot Rohr said in a post-match interview. He added: “Generally, I think it was a great experience for these young lads playing in front of a huge crowd for the first time but it would help them further in their careers.  “It’s plus-plus for the players playing against the 11th best team in the world,” he noted. Speaking in the same vein, Iwuala who captained the team in the absence of injured goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa said he was proud of the efforts of his teammates despite the loss. “it was a very great experience for us local-based players and it was an opportunity to show our quality,” noted the Enyimba striker. “We are very happy for the great opportunity but unfortunately, it ended this way; but generally, it was a great experience for us.”
