 Two children who went to watch a football match in their neighbourhood in Gboko, Benue State have been killed. The children Aondona Eric Abba, seven, and Aondoaseer Ernest Abba, six, left their home on Saturday to see a match at a viewing centre not far from their residence and did not return. Their parents Eric Abba and Ernest Abba, with help from others, searched long before they saw their footwear at a water-filled dugout, and later their remains the following day.  The children were believed to have been abducted and killed by their abductors. No one has yet ascertained why they were killed. A neighbour said such an incident was unheard-of in the area.
