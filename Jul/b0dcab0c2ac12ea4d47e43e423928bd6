 There were indications last night that the Senate may reject President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Social Media, Ms. Lauretta Onochie, as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) representing Delta State. The Nation investigation showed that Onochie’s nomination is among the big issues on the agenda of the Senate as it plans to proceed on Sallah break and its annual vacation.  There were indications at the weekend that Onochie was among issues that have caused ripples in the Ninth Senate. A senator, who spoke in confidence with our correspondent on Onochie’s nomination and some other matters, said there were doubts about the possibility that she would be confirmed. When told that it appeared the Senate had made up its mind to clear Onochie for the INEC job, he disagreed, saying: “Never mind all the stories they (the media) are writing. I doubt it.”
