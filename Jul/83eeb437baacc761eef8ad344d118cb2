A Federal High Court in Lagos on Wednesday sentenced a father of three, Emmanuel Olatunji, to 15 years Imprisonment for unlawfully dealing in 2.10 kilogrammes of Cannabis Sativa popularly called Indian Hemp. Olatunji’s conviction followed his “guilty” plea last month to a two-count charge preferred against him by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). Justice Tijjani Garuba Ringim convicted the defendant after reviewing the NDLEA’s case and exhibits tendered against Olatunji, including a certificate of test analysis; packing of substance form; a large brown envelope housing sample of the band weed; drug analysis report; the convict’s two comfessional statements and bulk of the seized banned weed. The judge gave the convict an option of N120,000 fine, in lieu of the jail term. He also directed the NDLEA to destroy the seized drug by burning it.
