Nigerian athletes to the Olympics in Tokyo have started training with their beautiful kits. The kits, which were made available by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, are being used at their pre-games camp in Kazarizu, Japan. A top source, who spoke with our correspondent in Abuja, said there was no time Nigerian athletes appeared in rag-tag kits. The source released 28 photos and video clip to prove that Nigerian athletes were given enough kits. The source said: “Nigeria does not have any problem on kits. In fact, we have one of the most beautiful kits. ” Our athletes have been training with the kits provided for them. We have pictures and video clips to show for it. “Check the pictures of their departure from here and their arrival in Japan, you will know that our athletes were fully kitted. “As for the picture in circulation, these innocent athletes woke up for breakfast and took it. Do they want them to wear their kits as pyjamas?”
