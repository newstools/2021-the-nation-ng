Singer Peruzzi has reacted after his alleged sexual assault victim, Daffy Blanco, revealed he died in her dream.
In a post shared via his Instagram page on Thursday, July 1, 2021, the music star prayed against all forces against him noting that they won’t succeed. “No weapon fashioned against me shall prosper. And that’s on default,” he wrote. In 2020, Daffy Blanco, a London-based Nigerian recording artiste, alleged that she was sexually molested by DMW artiste, Peruzzi. In a recent Instagram post, she has claimed that she saw the singer dead in her dream.
According to her, she had a nightmare where the music star died. She went on to advise her former friend to take care of himself. Sharing a photo of Peruzzi, a video of both of them and other posts, Daffy captioned same; “I wanna use this hour, this minute and this second to get this off my chest …I just realized how we take 24 hours for granted!!! “A few days ago I came across some pictures and videos of me and Peruzzi I watched them and laughed so much not to mention the conversations and our fights lol, Apart from everything that happen we were once cool, we spoke the same language and shared the same pain of losing our mothers. “Sometimes we joked and sometimes we spoke so deep that at times we even got emotional. “Day before yesterday I had a bad dream that he was gone… In that very dream I was crying and so emotional I kept saying no no it’s not possible, Not My Huncho ….! “When I woke up I thanked god that it was just a dream. Please take care of yourself please be safe …!!! “Life too short for me to hold grudges in forgiveness we heal. Love wins #forgiveness #lifetoshort.” The post came few hours after a member of Davido’s DMW crew, Obama DMW died after a suspected heart failure.
