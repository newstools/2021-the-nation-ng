England and Italy are preparing to make history as they go head-to-head at Wembley in the Euro 2020 final on Sunday night. The Three Lions are hoping to win their first major tournament since 1966, while the Italians will be looking to add a second European Championship trophy to the one they lifted in 1968. Wembley has a capacity of 90,000 but this has been capped at 60,000 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Italian FA has arranged for a maximum of 1,000 supporters to travel to London for the showpiece. Italian fans will only be able to travel on organised trips on charter flights and all travellers will have to respect a “security bubble” – meaning those arriving from Italy will all be seated in the same section of the stadium.  The team Southgate picks will partially be decided by the formation he thinks is best suited to defeat the Italians. The England boss opted for a 4-3-3 in England’s first two games before switching to a 4-2-3-1 in all but one of the remaining fixtures. Going on the assumption that Southgate will stick with the 4-2-3-1 formation he used against in the semi-final and quarter-final, don’t be surprised if you see the following line-up: Pickford (goalkeeper), Walker (right back), Stones (centre back), Maguire (centre back), Shaw (left back), Phillips (defensive midfielder), Rice (defensive midfielder), Saka (attacking midfielder), Mount (attacking midfielder), Sterling (attacking midfielder), Kane (striker). Like Southgate, Mancini has his trusted core of players he will almost certainly play, but Italy’s strength and depth means there has been rotation in all areas and they have a lot of talent to choose from.
