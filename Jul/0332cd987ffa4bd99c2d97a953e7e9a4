The Senate on Thursday confirmed nomination of Professor Sani Adam for appointment as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to represent North Central. The confirmation followed consideration of the report of the Senate Committee on INEC, which was presented by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kabiru Gaya (Kano South). The Senate had on Tuesday stood down the confirmation of Adam to allow for further legislative works by the Committee. Gaya, in his report, said: “After a thorough investigation into the petition against the nominee (Adam), the Committee found out that the petition against him was paltry and that the reason for the termination (not dismissal as alleged by the petitioner) was not based on gross misconduct but on rationalisation policy of the Federal Government. “The court judgement was based on whether or not his appointment should have been terminated and this has nothing to do with his integrity or moral uprightness.”
