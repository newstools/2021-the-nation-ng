Nigeria’s home-based players were thrashed 4-0 by Mexico in an international friendly game between the two nations at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Sunday morning. The Super Eagles starting lineup featured mainly players from the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) except for Ibrahim Sunusi, who plies his trade with CF Montreal. However, the gap in quality between the two teams on parade showed as Mexico dominated from start to finish to claim a resounding win. The Eagles defence could not find answers to the rampaging Mexicans while their strikers were also poor going forward. Mexico’s quality too much for the Home-based Super Eagles Mexico showed their intent right from the start as Hector Herrera nodded home from a corner kick in the second minute. Gerardo Martino’s side doubled their lead two minutes later through Rogelio Funes Mori, slotting home from close range from a Hirving Lozano assist. Interestingly, it looked like it would be a whitewash after Mexico netted two inside four minutes but it stayed at 2-0 at half-time. The Eagles under the watchful eyes of Gernot Rohr, who handed coaching duties to Paul Aigbogun, failed to muster a single shot on target in the opening stanza of the game. However, their resistance in the last 40 minutes of the first half failed to yield dividend as the Mexican made it 3-0 after six minutes. Herrera capitalised on an error from Eagles goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali to slot home his second of the night. Substitute Jonathan dos Santos further compounded Nigeria’s woes when he fired in the fourth 13 minutes from regulation time to put the icing on a dominant show by the Gold Cup champions.
