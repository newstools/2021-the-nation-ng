The Lekki Concession Company Ltd (LCC) on Thursday announced that it had added four new patrol vehicles to its security and emergency fleet for the Eti-Osa-Lekki-Epe Expressway and Lekki Ikoyi Link Bridge corridor. The vehicles are fitted with state-of-the-art equipment and branded in bright colours with retro-reflective lettering “to ensure visibility at all times and the safety and security of road users”. According to a statement, the vehicles were launched on June 29, 2021 for the LCC Route and Incident Management Team as a demonstration of the firm’s commitment to value-added services, including improved security and assistance to stranded road users. LCC’s Route and Incident Management Department was formally launched in 2009 and has over the years, assisted over 31,000 stranded road users, according to the firm. LCC’s Managing Director, Yomi Omomuwasan, who handed the vehicles to the Head of Department, Route and Incident Management, Michael Aina, said it was to render speedy assistance to distressed road users and ensure the safety of others. “With these additional vehicles, no one would be left stranded on either the road or the bridge irrespective of their status. We are all aware that distressed vehicles cause traffic on the road but with the state-of-the-art devices on these patrol vans, we will be able to render assistance speedily and effectively. This will, in turn, help us achieve our goal of better traffic management,” he said. The LCC, Omomuwasan added, is sensitive to environmental security and would continue to introduce more value-added services to aid commuters and boost transportation and security in the state. He said the firm’s mandate is more than tolling but also providing additional services to road users. Also speaking, Aina thanked the management for the vehicles, adding that it would boost his team’s operations.
