Fans treated Grammy-award winning singer, Burna Boy, who clocks 30 today, to a surprise birthday party. The surprise birthday party took place in Miami, Florida.
In a viral video, Odogwu was seen walking into a beautifully decorated space with people singing the “Happy birthday” song looked obviously stunned yet elated. Few days to his birthday, Burna Boy had spoken about how much he would love to be like his father in terms of character despite the fact that he is not so rich. He also invited all who can make it down to Miami on July 2nd to 5th to party with him.
The self-acclaimed Africa giant wrote: “I can’t believe I’m really turning 30 years old in a week. “My Father is Not rich at all But i pray that as this new phase of my life begins I can be even half the man that he is. I just want to be better and do better. “I’m feeling emotional as fuck right now. lol.
