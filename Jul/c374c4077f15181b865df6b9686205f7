He said: “To clock‎ 80, you must have a good mind. You are a great man and one of the greatest human beings on earth.” The iconic musician, who was accompanied by his wife, noted Igbinedion, who rose from grass to grace and conquered poverty, greatly surprised him. He said: “I have never smoked in my life. I do not take drugs. I do not drink alcohol. It is now that I started taking wine.

Parents must warn their children against taking drugs and not to wrongly imitate people.” The renowned musician was presented‎ a 75-inch plasma television and other gifts by Chief Igbinedion.
