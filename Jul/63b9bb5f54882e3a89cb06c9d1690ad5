Germany midfielder Toni Kroos has announced his retirement from international football. The 2014 World Cup winner earned 106 caps for his country, contributing 17 goals and 19 assists, with his final game coming in the 2-0 defeat by England in the Euro 2020 last-16 tie on Tuesday. Kroos, 31, said it was clear to him “for a long time” that he would not be available for the World Cup in Qatar next year and his priority was to focus on his club career with Real Madrid and spending time with his family. “I’ve played for Germany 106 times. There won’t be another time,” said Kroos in a statement released on Twitter. “I would have dearly wished, and I gave everything again, that there would have been 109 internationals in the end and that this one big title, the European Championship, would have been added at the end.”  “It was a great honour for me to be able to wear this jersey for such a long time,” he added. “I did it with pride and passion.” “I always did it with pride and passion. Thank you to all the fans and supporters that helped carry me with their applause and cheering, but also to those critics who gave me extra motivation. “Finally, I want to sincerely thank Jogi [Joachim] Low. He made me a Germany international and a World Cup winner. He put his faith in me, and we have written a long success story together.” Kroos made his Germany debut in 2010 and was selected for five international tournaments, with the highlight coming in 2014 when Germany won the World Cup in Brazil.
