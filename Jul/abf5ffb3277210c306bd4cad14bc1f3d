The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Wednesday disclosed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is yet to submit the name of its nominated candidate for the November 6 Anambra governorship election. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee Festus Okoye said the Commission monitored the party’s primary election and issued a report. He, however, said INEC didn’t disqualify any candidate for the Anambra election. There was a viral report that the Commission has cancelled the APC primaries which was won by Senator Andy Uba. Okoye said in a short statement sent to The Nation: “By the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for Anambra State Governorship 2021 Political parties are obligated to conduct party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from primaries between June 10 and today. Political parties are to submit the personal particulars and names/List of Nominated candidates between July 2 and 9 2021. “The 18 registered political parties gave the Commission the requisite 21 days’ notice of their intention to organize and conduct primaries. The Commission monitored the primaries of APC and issued a report. The APC has not submitted the name of any candidate as their duly nominated candidate and the Commission has not disqualified any candidate for the Anambra Governorship election.”
