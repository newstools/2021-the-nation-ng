UBA said Smalls and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have remained the backbone of economies all over the world and continue to represent a large percentage of businesses who contribute immensely to catalysing growth. Speaking on the bank’s recent loan position and its determination to buoy the nation’s SMEs sector, UBA Group Managing Director, Kennedy Uzoka, said the bank’s  passion for small businesses with great ideas has never been in doubt. He said the bank has demonstrated this in the support given the business community with its loan products tailored specifically to meeting the varying needs of all our customers. Uzoka said: “Despite the tumultuous impact of Covid-19 pandemic globally and across our 23 countries of operation, we created N519.0 billion additional loans as we continued to support our customers and their businesses. Customer deposits grew 48.1 per cent to N5.7 trillion, driven primarily by additional N1.8 trillion in retail deposits. “As a global bank, we remain well capitalized and determined to successfully drive financial inclusion on the continent through our innovative products and vast network. Our capital adequacy and liquidity ratios came in at 22.4 per cent and 44.3 per cent, well above the respective regulatory minimum of 15 per cent and 30 per cent.” The bank’s Group Chief Financial Official, Ugo Nwaghodoh, said: “The persistent low interest rate environment in 2020 exerted significant downward pressure on margins. Notwithstanding, our interest income for the year grew by 5.7 per cent (to N427.9 billion), driven by 8.2 per cent and 7.5 per cent year-on-year growth on interest income on loans and investment securities respectively. “Our interest expense declined by eight per cent (to N168.4 billion) driven largely by a 34.2 per cent decline in interest expense on customer deposits in our Nigerian operations, bringing down the Group’s cost of funds to 2.9 per cent, from four per cent in 2019.”
