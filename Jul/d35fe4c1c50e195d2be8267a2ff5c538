Despite his goalless start to the tournament, the Tottenham striker’s prowess is obvious to Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen. He believes the Danes may have an ace up their sleeve ahead of their Wembley contest in the shape of Kane’s Spurs team-mate Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. “We know his qualities, and everyone has an idea of what we can do to stop him,” said Christensen. “Pierre-Emile also knows him and it may be that he can share some things.” England are favourites to progress to Sunday’s final but the Danes claimed a 1-0 win against the Three Lions at Wembley last October in the Nations League in a contest where Harry Maguire and Reece James were both sent off. “We can use that meeting to make us believe that it is possible (to win),” said Christensen. “They have a lot of support but also a lot of pressure on them. I feel like we have the qualities to play against everyone. As a team, I would not say they are that much better.”
