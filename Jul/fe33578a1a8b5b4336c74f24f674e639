THE Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development is to partner with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in the fight against doping by athletes. Speaking during a courtesy call on the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare, the Nigerian Ambassador to UNESCO, Hajiya Hajo Sani commended the Minister for his innovations and sustained efforts. “We want to commend the Ministry for all the youth and sports focused initiatives that has been running and yielding results,” she said. “On our part, we will continue to ensure that our sportsmen and women compete clean in all competitions in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and beyond by not taking any substances that violate rules of Sports.”  Responding, the Minister said: “This meeting is coming at an opportuned time with few days to the commencement of the Tokyo Olympics. I believe your job as Nigerian Ambassador to UNESCO is a choice that is justifiable. “In a deliberate way we seek partnerships and collaborations in any organisation that is youth focused. “As a Ministry, we will keep availing the youth of our country the benefits that are available. We are barely eight days to the commencement of Tokyo 2020 Olympics and emphasis has been on the need to have clean sports as we’ve been charging the Athletes to compete fairly and clean without using any banned substances.”
