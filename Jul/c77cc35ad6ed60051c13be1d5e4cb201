Nollywood actress, Tana Adelana has said she doesn’t want to be a hardworking movie star who cannot afford her basic needs. The actress and producer made this statement in a recent chat with The Nation. Replying to a question about revenue in the movie industry, Tana disclosed that as much as she wants to tell beautiful stories that touch lives, she is applying wisdom so she doesn’t go broke and not be able to afford the things she loves. “You know me, I’ve done cinema movies and I’ve done some home videos as well. For me, I want to tell stories that will touch lives but I also want to make money. I’m not an actor who will act in a hundred films and cannot at the end of the day afford myself a nice ride, a good life generally because I love a good life,” she said. Adelana who is currently working on a project also talked about her fashion sense but shies away from any possibility of owning a fashion house. “No no no, I don’t have the energy for people to arrest me and tell me that I haven’t made their clothes or something is wrong with their clothes or what I ordered versus what I got. As I said, I’m too calm for that, I’ll just start crying. I don’t have the energy for that so I keep my fashion to myself. My fashion is not out there, I just like it simple, I like it comfortable and I like to make a statement.”
