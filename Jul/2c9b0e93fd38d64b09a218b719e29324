 The Orangun of Ila, Oba Wahab Oyedotun, has lauded President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State for granting the community’s demand to make it a university town. The community noted that Federal Government’s approval to site a university in the hometown of Chief Bisi Akande satisfied the yearning of over 40 years. The Ila-Orangun Elders’ Consultative Forum, on behalf of the community, led by its chairman, Pa Gabriel Oyinlola, during a press conference said: “We celebrate President Buhari, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State and Chief Bisi Akande, indigenes and non-indigenes of Ila-Orangun that have played their parts to make Ila-Orangun a university town.  “The quest of our community for a university has spanned over four decades (1989-2021). In this regard, while Mrs.Lydia Oyewumi Abimbola was the Commissioner for Education in the old Oyo State, her performance so impressed the Military Governor, Col. Adedeji Oresanya that he was determined to site the state university in Ila-Orangun but for the order from the above that caused that university to be sited in Ogbomoso which is now known as the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso. “We express our heartfelt gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Federal Government of Nigeria, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State, the Asiwaju of Ila-Orangun Chief Bisi Akande and others who have played their parts in having the institution of higher learning sited in Ila-Orangun. We are very ready to volunteer our lands and for the siting of the university.”
