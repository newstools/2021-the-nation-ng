The House of Representatives has mandated its Committees on Electoral Matters and Interior to investigate the root causes of the destruction of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) offices across the country. The committees are also to investigate fire outbreaks and ascertain the level of compliance to fire safety regulations of INEC offices nationwide. The committees are to report within four weeks for further legislative action. The House urged the Federal Government to provide adequate security in all offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) across the country. These resolutions followed a motion on the Call to Prevent Further Attacks on the Offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission Nationwide by Hon. Dachung M. Bagos. The House noted the increased attacks on the offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission across the country with the most affected states including Akwa Ibom, Abia, Anambra, Imo, Borno, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Kano, Ondo, Plateau, Rivers and the Federal Capital Territory with about 11 of the offices burnt down by hoodlums. It was worried that in the past 24 months, at least 19 INEC offices have been gutted by fire with a ratio of one INEC office per month. The House was concerned that if nothing is done to forestall future occurrences; there will not be adequate INEC offices to coordinate the 2023 and off-season elections in Nigeria. It also expressed concern that no one has been arrested and prosecuted for the criminal acts.
