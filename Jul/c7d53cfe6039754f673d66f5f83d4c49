While speaking with the Director of Sports, MFM, Godwin Enakhena, the sponsors of the event, Dr Olukoya said he was happy with the positive vibes the event has generated and would want to see a befitting end on Sunday. “I have seen pictures and videos of the 1st Dr & Mrs D. K. Olukoya Women Basketball competition and I am very impressed. My wife is also thrilled because young girls have an opportunity of showcasing their talents in the game of basketball.

Dr Olukoya thanked the Honourable Minister of Sports, Chief Sunday Dare for magnanimously agreeing to grace the final this Sunday.
