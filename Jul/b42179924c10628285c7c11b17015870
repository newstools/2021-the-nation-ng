 National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Lagos State Council has denied that a man (name withheld) alleged to be infecting people with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is not a member of the union. Secretary to the council, Comrade Oluwaseyi Bankole, said this while reacting to the viral story. The suspect, it was learnt, has been going round the city raping and infecting people with the disease. He said the police have arrested him following a tip-off.  Lagos NURTW scribe stated that the suspect who was said to be operating at Iyana Iba Motor Park was not a member of the union. Bankole said: “The man is not a member of our union. As a matter of fact, our union does not operate at Iyana Iba Motor Park. NURTW is made up of law-abiding citizens, hence our members will not engage in criminal activities. “We have records containing names of our registered members from units to state and national headquarters; the person is not our member.” Comrade Bankole urged Lagosians to always cross-check information before spreading it.
