This has already begun to affect crop yields, and the threat of food insecurity looms large. “The most affected communities are in the frontline local government areas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia, Kagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema’a and Sanga.” Receiving the report, Governor Rufai called on citizens to be law-abiding.
