Kwara All Progressives Congress (APC) Legacy Groups have explained why the Hon Bashir Bolarinwa-led APC acquired a befitting secretariat in Ilorin, the state capital. The groups said the refusal of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq to get a secretariat that would serve the interest of all party members informed the faction’s decision to acquire one. Spokesperson of the group, Kayode Ogunlowo stated this to reporters in Ilorin, urging President Muhammadu Buhari to call Governor AbdulRazaq to order ahead of 2023 general elections. Ogunlowo said: “We can all recall that before the emergence of Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq as a candidate of our party in 2018, we had a party Secretariat that was fully functional but immediately Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq became governor, he rented 3-bedroom apartment at Tanke area of Ilorin and tagged it state secretariat of the party. “After the expiration of our agreement with our landlord, the party structure was left without party Secretariat which informed the party executive led by Bashir Omolaja Bolarinwa to acquire a befitting party secretariat that was commissioned by Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed last week: “It is Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq who is notorious in factional politics and his affinity in divide and rule politics that needs urgent summon by the national caretaker and President Muhammadu Buhari, not Lai Mohammed who sacrificed his ego, ambition, time, loyalty and resources to deliver total victory for APC in Kwara state the before President Muhammadu Buhari to call Governor AbdulRazaq to order before it is too late.” On extension of membership registration and revalidation for two weeks, the spokesperson called on the Mai Mala Buni-led APC not to deliver materials for registration to wrong hands. “If the materials for registration are handed over to government agents many APC members would be disenfranchised and that will spell doom for future elections in the state for the party,” he added
