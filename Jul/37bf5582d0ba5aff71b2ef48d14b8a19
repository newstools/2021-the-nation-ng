One of Europe’s longest-standing rivalries comes to the fore again at Wembley in the semi-finals as Italy and Spain meet today  for the fourth EURO in a row, live on StarTimes. They drew 0-0 in the UEFA EURO 2008 quarter-finals. They also drew 1-1 in their opening game of UEFA EURO 2012, before locking horns again in the final which Spain won 4-0, the biggest ever final victory. While Italy ended Spain’s interest in UEFA EURO 2016, running out 2-0 winners in the round of 16. The semi-final match between Spain and Italy will be played on Tuesday at 8 pm. On Wednesday, England will face Denmark also at 8 pm. Both matches will air live and in HD on StarTimes World Football channel (English commentary) and the Premium Sports channel (French commentary) on Basic and Smart bouquets. With a semi-final match against Denmark on Wednesday, England will fancy themselves as the favourites of Euro 2020’s final and hopefully, finally end their 55-year wait for silverware. A 2-0 victory against long-time rivals Germany in the round of the last 16 and a 4-0 thumping of Ukraine in the quarter-finals were the result. A place in Wednesday’s semi-final against Denmark at home in Wembley Stadium is the reward for the two inspiring performances. “StarTimes subscribers are assured of uninterrupted viewing experience as our transmissions are weather-friendly, which means subscribers won’t suffer signal loss when it’s raining,” Lazarus Ibeabuchi, PR Manager, StarTimes Nigeria said.
