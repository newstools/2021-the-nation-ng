Early in the week, a report surfaced claiming that members of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) had appointed one Abba Kaka as the governor of Borno, under a new restructured leadership by an interim council. The news sent fears across the Northeastern state. Sentry even learnt that some ‘security reports’ promptly emerged, warning Governor Babagana Zulum to tread softly in the discharge of his duties. But according to sources, he quickly dismissed the stories out of hand. He said: “As far as I’m concerned, I’m the governor of Borno State and I don’t have any information that we have another government in the state. Yes. And I’m very much in charge,” he was said to have thundered while proceeding on a planned official visit he was reportedly warned to shelve. Sentry gathered that while speaking with his close aides later in the day, Zulum said he would be handing the state over to the militants the moment he allows their actions or inactions to determine what he will do or not do as governor. “He is undeterred. He is carrying on as if ISWAP doesn’t exist anywhere near him. He is not afraid. He says he will continue to govern the state as the man in charge irrespective of any thereat whatsoever,” our source, a member of the National Assembly, said.
