 The University of Lagos Medical Centre has warned the university community to be safety compliant as it had seen increased cases of flu-like symptoms associated with COVID-19. To this end, it has started offering only emergency services. A statement by the centre on the UNILAG website noted that the increased cases align with Lagos State Government’s warning about the start of a potential third wave in the state. The statement reads: “The University of Lagos community has also been affected by this potential third wave, with an increase in the number of patients presented to the University of Lagos Medical Centre with flu-like symptoms, which are similar to COVID-19. “The Medical Centre hereby assures all members of the university community that all necessary actions in line with the Federal and Lagos State Government guidelines have been taken regarding this potential threat in our community. “The Medical Centre will also return to providing emergency only services during this period, in order to protect all members of the community from potential infection within the facility. The Medical Centre Emergency Contact line: 09095879781 remains open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.” The medical centre also warned the university community to apply COVID-19 protocols in all activities – including temperature checks, use of hand sanitisers, social distancing, and 50 per cent occupancy of closed spaces. The Nation learnt of unconfirmed reports about some students and lecturers being infected with COVID-19 which allegedly led to a particular hall of resident being shut down and students told to evacuate by today.
