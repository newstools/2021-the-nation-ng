The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has warned that the country may witness planes skidding off the runways as the rains set in. The prediction, according to the agency, is due to the volume of rainfall witnessed in some parts of the country and how the runways were built. It also said the “above-normal” rainfall could lead to the erosion of roads and bridges, which would hinder the movement of people, goods and services across the country. NEMA’s Director General Ahmed Habib announced this in Abuja at the presentation of disaster risk management implications of the 2021 seasonal climate prediction and annual flood outlook. He said: “Squall lines, thunderstorm, wind shear, microburst, flash floods can affect runways, thereby disrupting landing and take-off of aircraft, causing a delay in flights, affecting sensors on runways and can lead to plane crashes in some cases.” On the impact of the rainfall on other infrastructure, Habib said: “Jetties may also be washed away, which would result in economic loss.” The agency chief said the document he was presenting would help in mapping out the communities that are at risk as well as those on safe locations to enable them set up temporary shelter.
