Further tests carried out by the State Ministry of Health at the Teaching Hospital revealed that all the persons were suffering from Cholera. “Samples were collected for further confirmatory tests of this finding. “Surveillance, contact tracing and risk assessment have commenced at the market and its environs, while the Enugu State Ministry of Health Emergency Operations Centre for Cholera outbreak response will be activated on Saturday 17th July 2021”. Obi explained that “Cholera is an infection caused by some strains of the bacterium vibrio cholerae. Risk factors are from poor sanitation, and contaminated drinking water. “The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Symptoms range from none, to mild, to severe. “Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and even death. Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure. “It is prevented by improvements in sanitation, use of clean water, hand washing and vaccines. Treatment involves replacement of lost body fluids orally or intravenously, zinc supplementation and antibiotics.”
