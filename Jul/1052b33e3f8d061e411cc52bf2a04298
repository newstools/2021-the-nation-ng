 Comptroller of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Muhammad Babandede said the Service is considering deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as drones, for effective border patrol surveillance. The drones will monitor movement of persons at the borders, which has been described as a threat to national security.  Babandede was speaking in Lagos at theÂ weekend. The Comptroller-General said the Service cannot man the vast borders of the country alone and so has invested in Forward Operational Bases (FOB) to patrol border areas that need monitoring.
