Senator Tokunbo Abiru (Lagos East) has commiserated with the family and associates over the demise of the legal luminary and the Asiwaju of Ikorodu, Chief Babatunde Olusola Benson. He passed on last week. He was  87. In a statement, he said:”The demise of baba has left a big vacuum in the rare class of elders that serve as stabilising force in Ikorodu, Lagos East Senatorial District and Lagos State at large. “He was a selfless man in his lifetime who lived for others. Late Chief B.O. Benson, KJW, SAN, was instrumental to the transformational development of my alma-mata, Lagos State University (LASU). “Late Chief Benson’s sterling achievements in various positions he held brought honour to Ikorodu Land and the people. As a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, chief Benson left an indelible legacy. “Chief Benson (SAN), an erudite legal luminary was a contemporary of my late father – Senator, The Honourable Justice Mubasheer Akanbi Olatunji Abiru. They belonged to the generation of young lawyers of the Ikorodu extraction pre-independence Nigeria. “They were both illustrious members of the progressive’s clan. They jointly pushed for development that impacted greater number of the people.”
