Stakeholders in the education sector have impressed on the federal government on the need to reposition the education curriculum towards Information and Communication Technology (ICT), in order to create wealth and promote self-reliance. Speaking at a youths leadership summit tagged, ‘Imaging the future’, Founder/Lead Strategist, Eduxtra Solutions, Dr. Dolapo Tukuru, said that the present education curriculum will not help Nigeria students for the future.  According to him, it is very necessary to let the students know the power of technology. “We want to introduce technology to students, so that they can start early to incorporate this new trend into their learning, even if the school does not teach this trend, students can get the relevant information through the platform we create for them.” Justifying the need for the event, the organisers, Principal Facilitator, Invent Youth Leadership Initiative, Mr. Elijah Olupona, said it was targeted at preparing the youths on how to become solution providers for the future. Tutor General, Mrs. Oludara Oyebisi Okelola, represented by Assistant Director of Education, Education District VI, Mrs. Shonibare Roseline Omolara said the summit was an eye-opener for their students.
