The Senate on Tuesday rejected the nomination of Ms Lauretta Onochie as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The Senate also stepped down the nomination of Professor Sani Mohammad Adam (North Central) to allow for further legislative action. This followed the consideration of the report of Senate Committee on INEC, presented by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kabiru Gaya. Gaya said the Committee rejected the nomination of Onochie because there is already a National Commissioner of INEC, Mrs May Agbamuche, representing Delta State in the Commission. Details shortlyâ€¦
