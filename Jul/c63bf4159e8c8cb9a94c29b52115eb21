ZINEDINE Zidane ‘wants to coach the France national team’ as his next challenge – but will have to wait with Didier Deschamps staying on until at least next year’s World Cup. The former Real Madrid coach is the strong favourite to replace Deschamps when his time in charge of Les Bleus finally comes to an end. Reports in France claimed Zidane ‘envisages almost nothing else than a job in charge of the national team’ but knows he will have to be patient. It comes as it was confirmed Deschamps will lead the team in their World Cup defence in Qatar next year despite their disappointing early exit to Switzerland at Euro 2020. France were considered favourites to add the European Championship to their world crown but lost 5-4 on penalties after a 3-3 draw in the last-16. The defeat led to calls for Zidane, whose second spell at Real Madrid ended in May, to replace Deschamps. But following a meeting with French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet, Deschamps will be staying on a little longer. Asked if Deschamps would be in charge at next year’s World Cup, Le Graet said: “The answer is yes. “We met on Wednesday and resolved it in three minutes. His desire to continue is strong and so is mine. There was no debate.” So Zidane, 49, will have to wait at least another year but reports in L’Equipe suggest he will wait for the national team vacancy to arise.
