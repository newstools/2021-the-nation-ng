The laying-to-rest service of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua aka Prophet TB Joshua has begun at the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Ikotun, Lagos State. The flags of different nations were flown at half-mast at the church premises. Sympathisers defied the rains to attend the service. Many sympathisers besieged the church premises but were denied entry as only a few were allowed entry in compliance with COVID-19 protocol. The wife and children of the late T.B Joshua alongside other personalities, including traditional rulers, Ondo Governor Rotimi Akeredolu; Lagos Commissioner for Home Affairs, Anofiu Elegushi attended to pay their last respects to the deceased. Security agencies including the Nigerian Army, Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Lagos State Neighborhood Safety Corps (LSNSC), Lagos State Traffic Management (LASTMA), DSS were stationed at the main entrance of the church and barricaded the entry and exit points to control the overwhelming crowd.
