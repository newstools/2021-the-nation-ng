Nigerian striker Sadiq Umar has   reportedly turned down the chance to move to Premier League champions Manchester City, who have so far been the only club to match the astronomical asking price by Spanish club UD Almeria for the prolific striker. Manchester City want to sign Sadiq, but then loan him out to newly promoted French Ligue 1 club Troyes AC. A source close to Sadiq told SCORENigeria the striker’s preferred destination is La Liga or the Premier League. “So many clubs want sign Sadiq but Almeria’s huge price tag has been the stumbling block,” the source informed. “Manchester City are ready to meet Almeria’s valuation, but Sadiq does not wish to go on loan. “He wants first-team football and he does not want to go to France. “And the French club (Troyes) he will go to were only promoted to Ligue 1 and City only recently bought a stake in them. “He wants to play in the top flight in either Spain or England, where he can fully showcase his talent.” Sadiq Umar scored 20 goals in the Segunda Division last season, but Almeria still failed to win promotion back to the Spanish top league. He has previously played in Italy, Holland, Scotland and Serbia.
