Nollywood actress Omoni Oboli has described herself as a very ambitious woman. The movie star stated this on social media in a recent post. According to the mother of three, in the past, she always downplayed being ambitious so feeble-minded persons do not feel intimidated thereby, feeling less of themselves. However, she has now decided to magnify that aspect of her personality irrespective of what people will say or how they’ll feel. Taking to her Instagram page, the filmmaker urged people to be driven by their ambition in their various enterprises as God has duly equipped everyone. Sharing a photo of herself, Omoni Oboli wrote: “I am a very AMBITIOUS woman. I used to make apologies for it to make small-minded people feel good until I realized it’s one of my life’s strengths so I TURNED IT UP!!! “The focus is LAZER sharp! #NoApologies. “Let your ambition fuel your hustle! God has already given you ALL it takes! #RoadToBillions.”
