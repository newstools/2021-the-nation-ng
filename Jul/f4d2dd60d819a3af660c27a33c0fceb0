The crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State deepened on Wednesday with three Senators from the state expressing unalloyed support for Governor Abdurahman Abdulrazaq. Senators, Ibrahim Oloriegbe (Kwara Central), Lola Ashiru (Kwara South) and Umar Sadiq (Kwara North), told reporters in Abuja at a press briefing in Abuja that Abdulrazaq is the authentic leader of the party in the state. The lawmakers said that Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, did not speak the minds of the party members when he said Kwara State, under the current administration had “entered one-chance.” They insisted that all the money realised by the APC in the state to prosecute the 2019 elections were judiciously utilised under the leadership of Abdulrazak. The lawmakers also explained that the revalidation and registration of APC members in the state would soon start to enable those who had yet to register, do so before the state party’s congress.
