Senator Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly, has resigned his membership of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). He has not declared interest in joining another party but there are feelers he may join the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) any moment from now. In his resignation letter dated July 9, 2021 addressed to PRP chairman in ward 6, Tudun Wada, Kaduna, Sani said the notice to leave the party was with immediate effect. It reads: “I wish to officially notify you of my decision to step aside from the Peoples Redemption Party. This notice takes effect from today. “I hope we shall continue to relate in the spirit of our struggle, our shared history and our common ideological principles.” Shehu Sani joined the PRP in October 2018 after he failed to win the primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2019 Kaduna central senatorial seat. The National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC had cleared Shehu Sani as the only candidate for the primary but Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai kicked against it. Subsequently, a primary election was conducted in the district and Uba Sani, the preferred candidate of El-Rufai, won the party’s ticket. Shehu Sani boycotted the primary and filed an appeal but Uba Sani’s details were sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as the APC candidate for the election The former Senator served on the platform of the APC but was critical of President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor El-Rufai’s governments from 2015-2019.
