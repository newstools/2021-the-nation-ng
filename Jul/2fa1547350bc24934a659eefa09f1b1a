Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, has married his third wife, Mariam, in a private ceremony over the weekend. It will be his third marriage in nine years, having ended his relationship with first wife Jamila in 2017 to marry Juliet Ejue the same year. The Kano Pillars Star, who welcomed a baby boy named Ahmed Musa Jr. in 2020 with Juliet, took to his Instagram to celebrate their wedding anniversary on July 1, 2021. He wrote, “Days have turned to months, and months into years, and if I had to choose again, it would be you. On this special day, our anniversary, I want to thank you for choosing to be on this journey with me.” Following a couple of controversies that led to his arrest for allegedly assaulting his first wife, Jamila Musa, the Nigerian international divorced her in 2017. Musa, who has had an impressive international and club football career, has played for several prominent clubs, including Leicester City and CSKA Moscow. He was part of the Nigerian squad that won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations and also well known for his brilliant performance against Argentina at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where he scored two goals at the group stage.
