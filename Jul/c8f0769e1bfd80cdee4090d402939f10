Musician and activist Eedris Abdulkareem has slammed young musicians for focusing on irrelevant things rather than using their music to enlighten the public and foster positive changes in the nation. Speaking in an interview with Dailypost, the 47-year-old rapper stated the young entertainers have what it takes to bring about positive change and accountability among the leaders only if they give themselves up for it just like the older ones have been doing. The “Jaga Jaga” rapper noted young entertainers are more interested in trivialities. He said: “The young entertainers are busy singing about booty, drugs and alcohol when they are supposed to use their music to enlighten people. I’m sure if the young guys in music are agitating like we are, things would have changed.” When asked if he thinks the youths can change the country by participating in the 2023 election, the rapper lamented the Nigerian youths are not ready for politics or to lead the country. Eedris said: “Nigerian youths are not ready for politics because they are busy watching Big Brother Naija and playing “kalukalu”.
