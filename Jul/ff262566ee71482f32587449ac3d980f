Lagos State Government has said human resource development and capacity building are crucial to achieving the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda. The government said it would continue to invest in capacity building of its workforce. Special Adviser to Governor Sanwo Olu on Education, Tokunbo Wahab, said this yesterday at a closing of a Three–Day retreat organised by the Office of the Special Adviser on Education (OSAE) at the Jubilee Chalets, Epe. Wahab stated that capacity building  and human resource  development  are part of the on-going reforms embarked upon by the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led  Administration. ‘’This retreat has given us the opportunity to exchange ideas and bring to the front burner, issues that are crucial to achieving efficient service delivery and greater productivity in our daily operations,’’ he said. While noting that government  activities  were limited last year due to the COVID-19 and some other challenges, the Special Adviser urged the workers to double their efforts  to make up for the missing gaps. Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Special Adviser, Mr Adeniran Kasali, said the retreat offered members of the OSAE family a unique opportunity to come together,   learn  new basics and  share knowledge about the core mandates of various agencies, department and units.
