The trial of a Danish, Peter Neilsen, accused of killing his Nigerian wife and their daughter, was on Monday stalled due to the defendant’s delay in filing an application. Nielsen, 54, is standing trial before a Lagos High Court, Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) on two counts bordering on murder. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the defendant was accused of killing his singer wife, Zainab and their three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Petra on April 5, 2018. At the resumed hearing, the defendant’s counsel Olasupo Shasore, SAN, filed an application requesting for some exhibits, to enable him conduct an examination. According to defendant, on the last adjourned date, he asked the court for some exhibits in preparation for his defence. Shasore said: “I would have filed the application before now, but for the strike”. He told the court that he had three more witnesses, a pathologist from University of Ibadan; a genetic witness from University of Lagos Teaching Hospital and the defendant. In his response to the application, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Adebayo Haroun, said the prosecution would need time to react to the application. Justice Okikiolu-Ighile said, ”I feel so uncomfortable because time is ticking. Immediately after the strike was called off, I said this is one of the cases I must hear. I don’t have a court yet. I denied a brother judge from sitting today because I told him about the importance of this matter.” Nielsen was arraigned on June 13, 2018 and he pleaded not guilty. The case was adjourned until July 19.
