A legal practitioner in Plateau State, Gyang Zi, who was kidnapped Monday evening in Jos, has been released by his abductors. Zi was said to be driving home after closing from work when the gunmen accosted him within the Little Rayfield Government House in Jos and abducted him to an unknown destination. His car was later found abandoned on an untarred road beside the fence of the Government House on Tuesday morning. The Spokesperson for the state Police Command, Ubah Ogaba, confirmed the release of the legal practitioner to reporters. According to him, the manhunt by security operatives for those who kidnapped the legal practitioner led to his rescue. However, a family source told reporters in Jos that the senior lawyer was released on Tuesday after the N10 million ransom was paid. The source further explained, “The kidnappers after making contacts with the family demanded N10 million ransom. N8 million was initially raised but the kidnappers threatened to execute him, if by 9 am on Wednesday the money was not paid. But we thank God for people who rallied round saved us from their threat.”
