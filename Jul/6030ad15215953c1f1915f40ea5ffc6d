 Four members of a family reportedly died yesterday of food poisoning in a Kwara community. The incident happened in Olori village in Kaiama local council, spokesman of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Babawale Afolabi said yesterday. “We received information about the death of two children of Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar of Olori village, Banni community of Kwara North, namely Umar Mohammed, 25, and Kadir Mohammed, 18. “They started vomiting around 4am on Thursday and were rushed to General Hospital, Igbeti. They were tested and confirmed to have taken poisonous food. After a few minutes, the two died in the hospital.  “As the family members were preparing to bury them, one of the grandsons of Abubakar, Umar Mohammed, also died.” He added that a team of NSCDC personnel visited the family to condole with them. “As we were with the family members, we were told another grandson, Bashiru Mohammed was rushed to another hospital, and on getting there, he was also confirmed dead in our presence,” Afolabi said. It was at that point that the personnel advised other family members who took the same meal with the deceased to go for a checkup at the hospital, he said. Indeed, other members of the family were admitted at the hospital for tests and treatment.
