The Presidency has debunked reports that President Muhammadu Buhari attempted to influence promotion of former Acting Chairman of the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu. The Police Service Commission (PSC), in a statement by its spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, had in reaction to certain media report, denied the Commission considered Magu for promotion to his next rank of Assistant Inspector-General of Police. An online medium had claimed that President Buhari was pressuring the PSC to include the former EFCC Acting Chairman on the promotion list. However, reacting to the media report in a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, the Presidency distanced Buhari from activities of the PSC, saying Magu’s fate depends on the outcome of the investigation. “We will be happy if your paper can correct the misinformation published, that President Buhari has ordered the promotion of Commissioner of Police
Ibrahim Magu. “As you can see, the PDP has taken off from there, issuing one of those thoughtless press releases of theirs. President Buhari, or any Nigerian President for that matter, is not responsible for promotions in the Police. That is the business of the Police Service Commission,
PSC. “In the case of the gentleman in question, who is currently under investigation, common sense dictates that his eligibility will be determined by that outcome. “The PSC could have given you the correct position on this if there was an effort to reach them,” the statement reads.
