Operatives of the Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) BEECROFT have arrested three suspected stowaways onboard a Europe bound vessel, MT SCF ALPHINE. The suspects, who were arrested by a patrol team on June 26 at the Lagos Anchorage, according to the base, were handed over to officials of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) on June 29. Base Commander, Commodore Bashir Mohammed, in a statement on Friday said 97 stowaways have been apprehended within Lagos waters in the last 12 months and handed over to the NIS. On the latest arrest, he said preliminary investigation revealed they accessed the vessel with the intention of illegally migrating to Europe. The Commander reiterated the base’s commitment to securing the country’s territorial waters in line with the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo’s Strategic Directive 2021-5. “As partners for a safe maritime environment, members of the public especially our host communities are enjoined to kindly furnish the base with credible information to assist in curbing the activities of criminal elements and economic saboteurs,” said Mohammed.
