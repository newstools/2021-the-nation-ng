The National Association of University Students (NAUS) has described as exploitative the N5 million tuition fee for King David School of Medicine in Uburu, Ebonyi State. A statement signed by the group’s National Public Relations Officer (PRO), Lekan Abdul-Azeez Soneye, and Chairman NAUS CMC, Ebonyi State, Ogwa Emmanuel Chidindu, faulted Governor David Umahi for setting the fees higher than what the average student can afford. The statement reads: “We have read from the press with displeasure a barbaric decision by the government of Ebonyi State under David Umahi to make the tuition fee of the newly founded University in the state a range between two million and five million naira. “Umahi declared that ‘medical students will be paying N5 million, while non-medical students, would be paying between N2 million and N3 million for tuition and other fees in the university’ that is to commence session in September this year. “We want to consider this statement to be a slip of tongue by the Governor who might have mistaken another paper for what he ought to read at the event yesterday for we think no reasonable government would place such an exploitative amount as school fees in a public varsity in this kind of economy.” As a public institution, the group said the new university must be affordable and therefore called on the governor to reverse the fees. “We demand that the governor reverse his backward statement now and release a statement that contains public friendly content about the University,” the statement added.
