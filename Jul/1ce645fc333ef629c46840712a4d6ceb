Actor and movie producer Yomi Fabiyi has celebrated the amassing of one million views by his latest movie ‘Oko Iyabo’ on YouTube. The movie sparked controversies on social media with Fabiyi criticised by colleagues for producing a movie on the alleged child defilement case of Baba Ijesha and going as far as using the real names of the parties involved. ‘Oko Iyabo’ also got him suspended indefinitely from Theatre Arts and Motion Practitioners Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN). However, taking to his Instagram on Tuesday, the filmmaker announced the controversial movie had hit 1million views as he expressed gratitude to fans, views and critics without whom he said such feat would not have be achieved. Sharing a post that held same words as the caption; he wrote: “OKO IYABO MOVIE now hit 1,000,000 views!(1 MILLION VIEWS). Thank you FANS VIEWERS and CRITICS, you all made it happen.”
