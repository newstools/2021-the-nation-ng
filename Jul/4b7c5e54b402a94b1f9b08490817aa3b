Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, urgently needs to pay more attention to the murmurings of some members of his All Progressives Congress (APC) if his now obvious plan to seek re-election in 2023 is to play out without much problem. Sentry gathered that in spite of the commendable efforts of the Remo-born governor to take care of party members and people of the state, some APC chieftains are feeling side-tracked. Sources within the party, many of whom said most things causing the grievances are unknown to the governor, told Sentry that some allies and aides of the governor are using his name to persecute others. “That is why you still find people complaining in spite of the governor’s effort to unite the party and satisfy the greatest number with his approach to governance and policies. Abiodun needs to be warned about these persecutions going on behind his back,” one source said. Sentry learnt that many members of sub-groups within the party like SIA group, Believe Movement and Matagbamole group among many others are unhappy as we speak. The Believe Movement, which is loyal to Gboyega Isiaka, in a communique issued Thursday, charged Abiodun to promote equity and fairness within the party. The accused some people of sabotaging efforts of numerous loyal party members. Earlier in the week, at a meeting in Sagamu, members of the SIA group accused some allies of the governor of using his name to marginalise Amosun’s loyalists. Sentry can only hope Abiodun will heed these warning signs and take action.
