The Senate may on Tuesday next week, consider and pass President Muhammadu Buhari’s request to the National Assembly for the approval of N895.84 billion as supplementary budget for the 2021 fiscal year. The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, dropped the hint in his remarks during plenary following a request by the Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator Jibrin Barau, for time to allow the Joint Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives come up with a harmonised report on the supplementary appropriations bill. Buhari last week transmitted a supplementary appropriations bill for N895.842,465,917 billion to the National Assembly for consideration and approval. He explained that the proposed amount would be used to fund the COVID-19 vaccine programme; fund health related expenditures for treatment of additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in states; and procure additional equipment captured in this year’s capital expenditure on Defence and Security to tackle prevalent secu- rity challenges across the country.
