Two commercial motorcyclists known as Okada have been killed after they were swept away by flood in Ondo town, Ondo West Local Government. The flood occurred after a downpour of rain on Monday night which lasted almost twice hours. One passenger in one of the okada who was rescued is currently receiving treatment. Witnesses said the bodies of the two okada riders were found in Oka area of the town near the Okeodunwo Bridge. One of the victims was identified as Aderemi, chairman of Ondo Okada riders Association (ACOMORAN).  Some persons claimed the deceased were riding through the bad portion of the bridge already covered by flood when they fell into it and got drowned. Others said they were swept to the bridge from a different location. Mr Jacob Lorim said the late okada riders could not have noticed the bad portion because of the flood. He said: “As they were passing, they mistakenly passed through the bad side and fell into the river. “A search party was organised, only to discover that the two bike men had died in the water. But one person who was rescued has been taken to the hospital for treatment. Mr Deji Ayodele said many persons have fallen into the river and got drowned due to the bad portion of the bridge whenever it is flooded. Chairman, Ondo West Local Government, Mr Ebenezer Akinsulire said letters have been written to appropriate authorities concerning the bridge and on the community’s bad road in order to put them in good shape.
