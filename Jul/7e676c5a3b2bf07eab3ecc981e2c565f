The winners of the CAF Champions League will be decided today, when Al Ahly and Kaizer Chiefs square off in the final in Morocco. Al Ahly progressed to the final with a dominant aggregate win over Esperance Tunis, while the South African giants came out on the right end of a tight two-legged clash with Wydad AC. Al Ahly progressed through the group stage with relative comfort, finishing in second spot after collecting 11 points from their six games thanks to wins over Al-Merrikh, Vita Club and Simba, while only losing one game. That saw them handed a quarter-final tie against Mamelodi Sundowns, and they took a 2-0 lead in the first leg thanks to goals from Taher Mohamed and Salah Mohsen, before Yasser Ibrahim made the aggregate lead 3-0 early in the second leg and a Mosa Lebusa goal would see the tie finish 3-1 on aggregate.  Pitso Mosimane’s men then took on Esperance Tunis in the semi-finals, and a Mohamed Sherif goal would see them take a 1-0 lead into the away leg. An Ali Maaloul penalty on the stroke of half time in the second leg settled Al Ahly’s nerves, before Sherif again got on the score sheet alongside Hussein El Shahat to see them come out as 4-0 winners, booking their place in Sunday’s final. Coming into the game on the back of three consecutive league wins since the beginning of July, most recently thrashing Misr Lel Makkasa 4-1 away from home, the Egyptian champions will go in search of their 10th  CAF Champions League title. Furthermore, they will aim to defend the trophy after defeating domestic rivals Zamalek 2-1 in the final last year. To retain the title, Mosimane’s men will have to get past a Kaizer Chiefs side who are on the hunt for their first CAF Champions League title.
