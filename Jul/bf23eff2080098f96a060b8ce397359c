REPRIEVE from perennial flooding has come for residents of 4 Local Council Areas which the drainage channel 6C passes through as the state has successfully desilted the major channel which housed mountainous refuse for over 10 years. The affected local Governments and Development Areas that the residents are enjoying a new lease of life are Surulere, Mushin, Odi-Olowo and Itire-Ikate. Speaking with newsmen after an inspection tour of the major primary channel in Idi Araba and Surulere,  the Permanent Secretary Office of Drainage Services, Lekan Shodeinde  an engineer said over 2 meters high refuse was evacuated at the Akonbi Crescent end and the LUTH tributary a few weeks ago. Shodeinde who was represented by the Director, Drainage Maintenance, Olalekan Ajani, an engineer said at the inception of the present administration, most of the major primary channels were not functional and accessible because of the high volume of refuse which covered all the drainages due to neglect. As attested to by some of the residents in Akonbi Crescent and LUTH collector and tributary, Idi Araba and Ishaga who spoke with TheNation during the inspection confirmed that  flooding has become a thing of the past since the state commenced regular clearing of the system 6C in 2019. He said the drainage channel which is about 13 kilometres in length and about 10 metres in depth is one of the most strategic, which had made the areas involved very popular in the rainy season for the wrong reasons. “The present administration is determined to make the state flood free by ensuring that the major water ways that belong to the Federal Government are kept clean including the primary drainages that is supposed to be maintained by Local Government regularly” he said. The PS said findings have shown that several Drainage channels which have been cleaned in the past turned out to be back in dirty state because of the unwholesome acts of residents and as such the Ministry ensures that the Emergency Flood Abatement Gang (EFAG) team work throughout the year across the state. He added that the Ministry also plans to provide canoes and wooden boats or it’s Emergency Flood Abatement Gang ( EFAG) operatives so that they make use of  it to clear floatables that are always noticed on channels that have been cleared immediately it rains.
