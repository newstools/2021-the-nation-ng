Officials of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have intercepted three major interstate drug cartels allegedly supplying illicit substances to some states in the northern part of the country. Agency spokesman Femi Babafemi said in a statement on Tuesday that seven suspected members of the syndicates have been arrested in separate raids carried out in Kogi, Nasarawa and Benue states, adding that  skunk and cocaine weighing over 843kg were recovered. Babafemi said a cartel led by one Augustine Emmanuel, 45, tried to move the  consignment through the waterways between Edo and Kogi states but was busted. Babafemi said the suspects were apprehended on Monday “at a Jetty in Idah, Kogi State, where a Toyota Avalon car…loaded with 487kg of cannabis and ferried across the waterways from Agenebode, Edo State to the Jetty in Idah, was seized and the syndicate leader arrested. “In Nasarawa State, a team of NDLEA operatives on July 8 raided one of the most hostile drug joints in the state capital. About 356kg of cannabis and various psychotropic substances were recovered, with the arrest of four major drug dealers, including a notorious drug kingpin in Nasarawa State called Boogie whose real name is Muhammed Umar.” NDLEA said Boogie’s supply area included Kano, Plateau, Benue and parts of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja.
