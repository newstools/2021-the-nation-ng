No fewer than 32 inmates have been freed from a correctional centre in Sokoto State. The inmates, released on Wednesday, were pardoned under the state governor’s prerogative of mercy. Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Suleiman Usman announced the pardon on behalf of Governor Aminu Tambuwal. Usman said the gesture was aimed at enabling ex-inmates to reunite with their families, become decent citizens of the society and legitimately earn a living to contribute to the development of the state and country. “Is also a measure intended to decongest the centre and protect the inmates from being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,” he added. The freed inmates were enjoined to shun crime.
