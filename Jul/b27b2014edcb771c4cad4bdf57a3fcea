 KINGDOMBOIZ Store has launched a music global distribution platform in Africa to reward independent gospel artistes in Africa. According to the company, it is a platform that pays revenue directly to the  Nigerian artistes’ accounts through the just-launched Kingdomboiz store. Founder of Kingdomboiz store, Tobi Isijola explaining the reason for creating the platform, said he began Kingdomboiz to propagate the gospel and to help artistes benefit from their resources as well as to glorify the name of God through their music.  On why it is exclusive to gospel acts, Isijola said: “We believe in propagating the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ via music, we believe in promoting Gospel contents. We are a vessel through which the Gospel of Christ will be spread to all parts of the world via music or any other form”, he said. Confirming its authenticity, Isijola said “This platform does not take advantage of artistes, rather it helps them to get to their audience. Once we distribute to other digital stores, we have our customized smart link, automatic audio trailer, for those in Nigeria, they receive their money in their Nigerian accounts for international clients via PayPal. The platform is financially secured, every artiste has an agreement to sign before we can proceed,” said Isijola.
