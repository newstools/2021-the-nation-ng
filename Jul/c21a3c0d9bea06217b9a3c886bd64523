The Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) has cautioned the Federal Government and National Assembly not to use the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to pave the way for Dangote Petroleum Refinery to monopolise importation of the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) petrol. NARTO noted since the essence of the bill is to create room for competition, restricting petroleum products importation licence to only local refiners will against that. These were contained in a statement by its National President, Alhaji Yusuf Lawal Othman in Abuja. NARTO said: “As the nation is now intensifying efforts to make our refineries work, we are seriously taken aback by the provision in the bill restricting importation license to only local refiners. “All hands should be put on deck to ensure that PIB does not monopolise the importation of PMS as currently provided in the bill. “Since one of the major reasons for the PIB is to ensure that there is competition in the downstream oil and gas industry, any provision to the contrary will make waste of all our collective efforts in that regard.” NARTO advocated that the PIB provides adequate encouragement and incentives to International Oil Companies and indigenous producers to invest in the refining sector of the oil and gas industry. According to the association, the incentives will help in bringing in the much-needed investments in domestic refining. It said: “As the two chambers of the National Assembly meet to harmonise their positions, we earnestly plead that these issues be taken on board as they would rather enhance in the possibility of harnessing the full benefits and potentials of the bill to enable it meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.”
