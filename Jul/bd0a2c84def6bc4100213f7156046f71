Police on Thursday arrested a 43-year-old woman, Sharon Williams, in Ijede, Lagos, for allegedly torturing and abusing a five-year-old boy. Sharon, an aunt to the boy, was picked up following a complaint by one Kayode Akinborode of the Child Protection Network (CPN). Akinborode told The Nation that they got a report from the Lagos State Ministry of Youths through the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation that the boy was locked up for over six months by  the woman. Akinborode said several attempts to gain access into the house of the perpetrator failed. “But with the support of the Lagos State Neighbourhood Security Corps (LNSC) Ijede Office and the Nigeria Police Force Area N, Ijede Division, she eventually opened the door and was arrested. The boy was found behind a fridge in the sitting room with a very deep cut on his head and several injuries on his body. His hands are already stiff as a result of being tied up for long,” he said. The boy has been rescued and is being treated at Ijede General Hospital.
