Nigerian Idol season 6 two finalists – Francis and Kingdom – are locked in a battle for a grand prize of N50 million. The fate of the two singers will largely depend on the results of the final voting round which ended on Thursday, July 8, 2021, at 9 pm. Whoever emerges winner between Francis and Kingdom will walk away with a recording deal of a six-track EP, with music video shoots for three of the songs, and over 50 million Naira worth of prizes which include a N30 million cash prize and a brand new SUV. The show organiser, Multichoice Nigeria, and headline sponsors, Bigi and Tecno, made the announcement on Thursday, July 8. The Nation also gathered that a breakdown of the other prizes reveals a BIGI branded refrigerator and one year supply of BIGI soft drinks from Rites Food Limited, an all-expense-paid trip to Seychelles and a wide range of TECNO products, a weekend getaway package to Dubai for two from TravelBeta, and a DStv Explora fully installed with a 12-month DStv Premium subscription package. As a platform that is a launchpad for young, talented Nigerians to achieve their dreams in music both on the local and global stage, the first runner-up in the competition will also walk away with a single produced by a leading music producer in Nigeria and a top-notch music video shoot.
