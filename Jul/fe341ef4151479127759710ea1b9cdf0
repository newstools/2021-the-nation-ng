The DG said this in Abuja, during an interactive session with members of the media. He said that licenses are only revoked when people given the licenses refuse to work on or when they refuse to pay the required dues. Nkom added, “So far, we don’t just revoke today and give to Mr. V tomorrow. No, we revoke, protecte the area during that period of three months or whatever. So that if the person does not send a petition because the person can write, once the area is blocked for the three months period. I do this so that I don’t revoke and realise that the issue is still being heard.’’
