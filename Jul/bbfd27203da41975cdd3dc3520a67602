Lionel Messi may be the favourite to win the 2021 Ballon d’Or, but former Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri believes Italy lynchpin Jorginho has strong claims. Jorginho, 29, was ever-present over the last season with Chelsea, helping the Blues clinch Champions League glory and finish in the top four of the Premier League. The midfield conductor has been just as impressive on the international stage, helping the Azzurri reach the final of Euro 2020. Jorginho scored the decisive penalty in the shootout victory over Spain in Tuesday night’s semi-final, and his former manager believes he would be a worthy winner if Italy emerge victorious in Sunday’s showpiece.  “If Italy were to win the European Championship, it is clear that he would become one [a favourite for the Ballon d’Or],” said Sarri. “He is a refined player, probably not understandable by everyone. You have to set your eyes on him and only watch him in the game. “He is so good and intelligent that he makes everything seem easy, rarely anything spectacular remains in your eyes. This is his greatness.” The player struggled to live up to his £50million price tag at first and there were questions of whether his side-to-side passing and possession-based approach was suitable for the Premier League. But Jorginho won over many of his critics over the course of his 43 appearances last season, during which he also chipped in with eight goals. Nonetheless, he remains a firm outsider for the Ballon d’Or, whereas Messi is a strong favourite to win the accolade for a seventh time.
