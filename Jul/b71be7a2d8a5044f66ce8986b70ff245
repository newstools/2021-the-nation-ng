 Four inmates have escaped from the Jos Maximum  prison in the state capital. They fled from the correctional facility in the early hours of yesterday, our correspondent gathered. It was further learnt that the escapees are Fulani herdsmen, who were remanded after being arraigned before a Barkin Ladi court last year. The Nation had reported that the some Fulani herdsmen stormed the court and overpowered the warders, leading to the escape of five suspects.  Four of them were later rearrested after intensive search by security agents. Those who escaped yesterday from the correctional facility were reckoned to have had insider connivance. Correctional centre spokesman Geoffrey Longdien confirmed the jailbreak. He said, “Four inmates of the correctional centre escaped in the early hours of Thursday at the centre.” Longdien  said investigation was ongoing.
