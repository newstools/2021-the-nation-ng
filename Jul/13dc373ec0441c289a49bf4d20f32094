The Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) says the federal government has granted an “import waiver” on the country’s basketball team kits for Tokyo Olympics — after weeks of delay at the seaport. The kits had been shipped into the country by Peak, Nigerian basketball teams’ kits sponsor, but were being delayed at a seaport in Lagos. According to Babs Ogunade, a board member of NBBF, the delay was due to “a lack of documentation and miscommunication between the ministry of finance and the ministry of sports”. The Ministry of Finance on Monday approved the final waiver for the kits, paving the way for the release by the customs any time from now. Ministry sources confirmed that the Ministers of Finance and Youth and Sports worked to ensure the documentation needed for the waiver to be secured. “The Minister of Finance has signed the waiver and what remains is for the customs to release the basketball kits upon presentation of the waiver to the NBBF so that our team can enjoy the uniforms donated by Peak. The Ministry has been working on this for weeks and happy that things are moving along now“. Yesterday, the federation, in a tweet on its verified Twitter account, announced that the federal government has granted “an import waiver” for the kits to be released for usage by the teams. The basketball governing body added that plans are now in motion to clear the jerseys from the port immediately. “The Federal Government through the Ministry of Finance has granted the NBBF an import waiver for our merchandise from Peak at the port,” the tweet read. “Heading to Customs now to formalise and clear the jerseys in time for the Olympics.”
