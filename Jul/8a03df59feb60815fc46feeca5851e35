Senior Pastor of First Baptist Church, Kaduna, Rev Banjo Ajao confirmed the development to The Nation on Sunday morning.

Ajao said some of his church members close to Popoola have visited him. According to a Baptist evangelist, Okekunle Isaac Adewale, the pastor was released on Thursday. Adewale made the announcement on Facebook on Thursday. He said: “The news getting to us now confirmed that Rev’d. Popoola David of Calvary Baptist Church, Kaduna has been released from the kidnappers today.” Details of his release remain sketchy as at the time of filing this report. It remains unclear whether any ransom was paid to secure Popoola’s release.
