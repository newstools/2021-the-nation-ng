 The Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has signed a five-year agreement with the State PSP operators with the objective of enhancing the operational activities of the operators, boost their confidence and reassure them of government’s commitment to their sustainability. According to the  Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) of the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni, who oversaw the signing of the agreement, which held Wednesday in Lagos, the State was entering a new phase of waste collection and disposal and would strengthen the sector and make it wholly manageable. The LAWMA helmsman enjoined the PSP operators to improve on their service delivery and in good faith repay the magnanimity of the State Governor by ensuring that they discharge their duties diligently. “The idea of people dumping waste indiscriminately into drainages, water channels, the median and other unauthorised places must stop as it would be seriously frowned against and offenders prosecuted,” Odumboni warned, stating also that the agency will not tolerate non-payment of waste bills. Responding, the President, Association of Waste Managers of Nigeria (AWAMN), Mr. David Oriyomi, expressed the gratitude of the operators to LAWMA for the milestone recorded in the signing of the agreement, stating that the gesture will boost the morale and confidence of their members.
