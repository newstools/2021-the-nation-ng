If you are one of those overjoyed by the recent rumour of a ‘very serious rift’ between former Imo State Governor, Emeka Ihedioha, and the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), this is for you. Ihedioha and Imo PDP say there’s no problem between them at all. If anything, the party and the former House of Representatives Deputy Speaker insist they are busy plotting their return to Government House as soon as possible. Stories about a looming face-off between the former governor and the leadership of the party in the state over the re-arrest of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, Nnamdi Kanu, went viral during the week with opposition party chieftains claiming Imo PDP is about disintegrating. But the party has issued a disclaimer. Similarly, the former governor, Ihedioha has been denying the claims as false and unfounded. PDP’s rebuttal, contained in a statement by Publicity Secretary, Ogubundu Nwadike, stated that Ihedioha has never had any dealings with Kanu. It said there was no betrayal and thus no fallout over a U-turn on Kanu’s re-arrest. He said: “Talking about Ihedioha betraying Kanu is irresponsible propaganda and blackmail that failed on arrival. That makes insensible and meaningless the warped thought of “Imo PDP falls out with Emeka Ihedioha over u-turn on Nnamdi Kanu re-arrest”. There can’t be a u-turn when there was never a drive out.”
