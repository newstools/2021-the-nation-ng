The   founder of Africa For Africa (AFA)  sports apparels , Ugo Udezue, is confident that  both Nigeria’s men (D’Tigers) and women (D’Tigress )national basketball teams  are strong enough  to finish on the podium at the delayed  Tokyo 2020 Olympics  Games. Speaking in Lagos yesterday, Udezue said the impressive makeup of both D’Tigers and  D’Tigress is an indication of the quality  at the disposal of the teams’ handlers hence  it offers the country  her best  hope of winning medals in the basketball events of  Tokyo 2020. “ Of course, I have always predicted right  and  this is the very first time we are having a world class coaches for the teams- Mike Brown  (D’Tigers )  and Otis Hughley Jr. (D’Tigress )-and if you look at the teams , the oldest person in the team is 30-years-old in the case of the D’Tigress and they are fresh, young and athletic,”  Udeze explained.“ Of course, I’ll be absolutely surprised  if we don’t get to win medals in basketball at the Olympics. “ Both teams are capable of getting medals and I’m sure about this.” Udezue said he  was not oblivious  of the challenges ahead of the  teams in Tokyo  given the calibre of the teams that would be on parade  in  both the men’s and women’s basketball event but he insisted  that both the  D’Tigers and D’Tigress can weather the  storm. Meanwhile, the 42-year-old Udezue said he wouldn’t have been prouder with AFA  Sports  being  the official apparel provider for the Nigerian delegation to the Olympics. “ Where we (AFA Sports)  are today is a testament of  the kind of hardwork we’d put in this project  in the last three and half years but I’m duty-bound to contribute as much as I can to the development of sports not only in Nigeria but throughout Africa,” he said. “This is the first time an African country is going to the Olympics without the known major brands, and we are happy that AFA Sports is already making inroads across the continent.”
