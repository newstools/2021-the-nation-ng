Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has condemned the raid on residence of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Ighoho by security operatives in Ibadan Oyo State. In a statement by IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, the group described the invasion of Igboho’s home as barbaric. “Sunday Igboho has not killed anybody. Nigeria government and her security operatives invaded his home and kidnapped his innocent women in the house because of the proposed rally in Lagos on Saturday 4th of July 2021. “Fulani and their collaborators are trying to bring catastrophe in Nigeria. They are trying to plunge Nigeria into serious crisis that will consume everybody. They should stop taking the indigenous nations in Nigeria for granted. Enough of this impunity!” The organisation expressed solidarity with Igboho saying “IPOB worldwide is solidly behind Sunday Igboho and Odua nation movement. ” The attack on Igboho is akin to the attack they unleashed on the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Mazi Nnamdi on September 14, 2017 when the military Python danced in his country home. “It’s very appalling that the Nigeria security agencies are aiding and abating herdsmen and Boko Haram, ISWAP and other Fulani terror groups to kill innocent citizens in Nigeria, while suppressing those genuinely defending their people.” It added: “Nigeria will soon regret their actions towards the Southern Nigeria and Middle Belt region. “The whole Southerners in the army, police, DSS and the security outfit in Nigeria must understand that this fight was brought to their homes by Fulani Jihadists. Nobody should think that things are still normal.”
