Singer Waje has taken fans on a sneak peek through her love life. The single mother of one said she seems to be in same boat with a friend as it’s been donkey years since she gave out love and same person reciprocated the act. Waje noted the situation was either she was giving and not receiving or receiving and not giving. The vocalist wrote: “A friend just said to me “Waje, I can’t remember what it feels like to love someone and that same someone love me back.” “Omo! I realised we are in the same WhatsApp group. It’s either I’m being loved and not reciprocating or vice versa. “We move. One life.”
