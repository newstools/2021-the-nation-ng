Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, the host of BBNaija show and BBNaija Reunion show, has explained why he’s upset with two of the ex-housemates of the BBNaija Lockdown. In one of the highlights of the just-concluded reunion episodes, Lockdown ex-housemates Lucy and Kaisha got into a fight. Although the fight was not aired, Ebuka confirmed that it did happen and that the girls ruined his shoes during the scuffle. “They ruined my shoe that day; I’m actually upset,” he said. Continuing, Ebuka said they didn’t only ruin his shoes, he fell on the floor while trying to break the fight. “I’m actually happy they didn’t air the fight. I actually fell on the floor trying to avoid it.” Ebuka also stressed that he has no power to influence anything on the show nor had he influenced anything on the reality TV show. He said: “There are four companies that run Big brother, Endemol, a Dutch company, there is Multichoice, there is MNET Nigeria, there’s Red Pepper Pictures which is the production company, that is four companies. “Nothing happens on that show without the approval of these people, and then my wife is the one who runs the show? I find it so weird that people believe these things.”
