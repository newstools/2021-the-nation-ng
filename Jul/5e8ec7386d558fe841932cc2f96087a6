The Chairman of Emohua Local Government Area, Rivers State, Chidi Lloyd, shut the gate of the council denying workers, who came late, access to their offices. Lloyd resumed duty under a tree a few weeks ago after his inauguration to monitor the activities of the council workers. On assumption of office, Lloyd warned that his administration would not tolerate lateness and absence from members of staff. Some workers of the council were seen stranded at the councilâ€™s gate on Wednesday following the decision of the chairman to lock the gate at 8:00 a.m. The council chief reportedly arrived at the office at 7:30 a.m and waited till 8am to lock the gate against latecomers. Lloyd also introduced a new attendance register for the council and workers were seen on a long queue jostling to write their names.
