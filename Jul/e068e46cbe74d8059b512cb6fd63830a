Movie director Brenda Uphopho has lashed out at Instagram comedians and skit makers, Zicsaloma, Mama Tobi and others for exploiting the feminine form by portraying themselves as women. According to Uphopho, these cross-dressing Instagram comedians are perpetuating stupid stereotypes by exploiting women’s form, journeys and voices quite in an awful manner. The movie director stated these behaviours they accentuate in their skits aren’t true to all women while berating them to quit with the nauseating mimicry disguised as entertainment. Taking to her Insta story, Brenda wrote: “Crossdressing comedians .. until you mimic and caricature women in your ridiculous skits before you can make it abi? “Reinforcing all the behaviours that aren’t true to all women, exploiting all of their expressions. “Nobody should tell me its art o! It’s Odious puppetry and its gone on for way too long.. Mama Tobi, zicsaloma and co.. It’s enough. Everyday, women are exploited, Every effing day.’’ Meanwhile actress, Lala Akindoju also stepped in to register her stance on the matter as she expressed support for her colleague affirming that the crossdressing skit makers have to stop with their constant loathsome caricature of the feminine gender. Lala Akindoju wrote: “Louder!”
