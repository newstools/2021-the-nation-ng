 Comedian Francis Agoda aka I Go Dye has reacted to the attack by DSS operatives on residence of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Igboho in Soka, Ibadan, last week. I Go Dye stated that DSS operatives should use the same application in attacking Sunday Igboho’s house on bandits and kidnappers of school children in the North. According to the Delta-born, it is absolutely wrong to have invaded the residence of someone without prior invitation. He urged people to imbibe the culture of speaking up against such injustice even though they haven’t been hit directly. Sharing a photo of Sunday Igboho, the 42-year-old comic act wrote: “The DSS SHOULD USE SAME APPLICATION THEY USED TO ATTACK SUNDAY IGBOHO HOUSE, SHOULD BE USED ON THE BANDITS AND KIDNAPPERS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE NORTH. “What’s right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong and should be spoken against, because violating ones right by attacking someone’s residence without inviting the person to the security institutions is wrong. “We shouldn’t wait till it affects your immediate brother before you condemn the attack on Sunday’ Igboho residence. “Yes security institutions can make arrest at any time but let’s not give majority of Nigerians that this promptness of action has a regional or ethnic sentiments. “The same application should be used on the bandits and kidnappers of school children in the North.
