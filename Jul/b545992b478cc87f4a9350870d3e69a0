Team Nigeria’s Track & Field  athletics contingent to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games  would be led by by the Chief Tonobok Okowa-led Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), NationSport can report. After a protracted  crisis, two factional  presidents and  boards of the federation emerged after two elections were held last month  with Okowa  elected in Abuja and Ibrahim Gusau offered a fresh four-year mandate in Birnin Kebbi. Though the World Athletics are yet to ratify  any of the two factional  presidents , our correspondent gathered  that the Delta State’s Sports Commission Chairman, Okowa who  is endorsed by  the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development , would be the AFN leader to the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics  to be held between 23 July and  9 August  in Tokyo. “ Of course, the AFN will be at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics  and Okowa is leading the team,” a source privy to Team Nigeria   arrangement to the Olympics told NationSport. Meanwhile, the Athletics events  of  Tokyo 2020 will  reportedly be held during the last ten days of the Games between  30 July and  8 August at the Olympic Stadium, Tokyo, The 80,000 capacity (with temporary seating) stadium  will also serve as the main stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the venue for track and field athletics events of the Paralympics.
