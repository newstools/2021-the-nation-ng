The House of Representatives has begun moves to harmonise the retirement age of staff of Legislative Houses. The bill to harmonise the retirement age was sponsored by Chief Whip. Mohammed Tahir Mongunu. The Bill seeks to extend the service year of legislative staff from 60-65 years and from 40-45 years of service as against the usual civil service age of 60 years and 35 years of service. There was an earlier controversy as to whether a resolution passed by both Chambers of the National Assembly can amend the civil service rules by increasing the retirement age of staff of the National Assembly. Mongunu said the Bill hopes to lead to modest improvement in the condition of service of staff, strengthen and reposition the legislative amr by laying a solid foundation for sustainable legislative bureaucracy. He said the Bill will also help build institutional memory and develop career progression plan within the Bureaucracy of the National Assembly. In addition, the Bill seeks to professionalise and ensure the transfer of knowledge and experience by the top Level Management Staff who are at the verge of exiting the system. Mongunu said: “By the time the current top level management exits, most of the staff who came through federal civil service would have left service.
“It require strong capacity and knowledge to pilot and stabilize the National Assembly Bureaucracy, hence the 5 years extension remains a better option, instead of hiring retired staff as consultant to do the same work they can do with just 58 years without additional cost and burden.”
