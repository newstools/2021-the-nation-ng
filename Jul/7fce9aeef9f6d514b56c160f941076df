Nollywood actor Jim Iyke has stated as individuals, everyone owe the world a certain responsibility whether we admit to it or not. The movie star, in an interview with Sunday Scoop, said he did not handle his early days of fame too well as he was excessive in his actions. This, he admitted, earned him quite a bad reputation as he was unable to conduct himself with the best decorum. Jim Iyke further stated that the earlier one comes to terms with their responsibility to the world and begin to act on it, at that point; life ultimately becomes meaningful and worthwhile. According to him: “One cannot make a difference in anything in life if one is not open to criticism. “At first, don’t forget we were not schooled about what to expect as regards being famous and handling fame. We did not understand what it meant. “We did a little bit too much that earned us bad reputation. I could not conduct myself with the best decorum in those days. “As one gets older, one understands oneself, one’s pattern, the people around one and the responsibility that has been entrusted unto one. It is no small gift to influence people. “One owes the world a certain responsibility whether one likes it or not. We refused our responsibility along the way but once one embraces it, things would become easy. That is what I do these days. It is about my businesses, family and mental health.”
