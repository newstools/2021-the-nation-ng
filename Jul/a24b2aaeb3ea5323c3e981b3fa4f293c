 Two sisters Grace Osagede, 60, and Theresa Suberu, 58, are said to have kept the remains of their mother Madam Agbenese Oshoma, 78, in their apartment in Benin, Edo State for nine days, not minding the stench from the decomposing body. The incident reportedlyhappened at Universal Road, by Medical Store Road, Okhoro in the state capital. Neighbours who were worried by the foul odour from the apartment, forced the door open, only to discover the decomposing body.  When confronted by neighbours, the women claimed that God instructed them not to disclose the death of their mother to anybody, while going about their normal daily activities. The landlord and some neighbours later got an ambulance, which moved the body to a nearby morgue and also invited the police. Police spokesman Bello Kotongs confirmed the incident, saying the two sisters were not arrested, since there was no reasonable basis for it.
