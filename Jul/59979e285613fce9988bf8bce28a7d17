Thousands took to the streets across the country after Italy beat England 3-2 on penalty kicks to win the trophy at Wembley late Sunday for their second continental title. Flares were lit in celebration and people were singing and dancing after goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had saved the final kick. Many fans had gathered in front of the Colloseum and at the Piazza del Populo in Rome to watch the game on big screens. A government statement said that Draghi wanted to to thank the team, coach Roberto Mancini and his staff.
