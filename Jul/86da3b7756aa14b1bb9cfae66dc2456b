Wives of a man tortured to death by policemen in Enugu State have appealed to the state Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality and Extra-judicial Killings, to order the police command to pay them N3.9 million being the outstanding sum in unpaid damages. According to a petition submitted to the panel by Evangelist Obiageli Chukwu and Mrs Mary Amuche Chukwu through Olu Omotayo of the Civil Rights Realisation and Advancement Network (CRRAN), the deceased, Chijioke Chukwu, was tortured to death in July 2010 by policemen led by one Inspector Ignatius Nweje of the defunct Special Anti-robbery Squad of the Enugu police command. The petition added that the deceased was arrested for confronting some members of Pastor Dan Obineboâ€™s Victory Prayer Ministry, who were stealing maize from his farm. It noted that having pursued the matter through the courts, the wives were awarded the sum of N5 million after the court held the police liable for the torture to death of their late husband.
