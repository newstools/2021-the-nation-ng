Nigerian artiste, Bella Shmurda, has said upcoming musicians must attend seminars in other to understand the industry and find purpose. He made this statement during a recent interview. Bella noted being an artist has gone beyond just the singing but also the process of doing the business for those who want to stay relevant. He further said that many artists are only interested in fame. “I think we need to start doing something like seminars for all up-and-coming artists. We need to educate them about some things. “They have to know where they are going. Some artists don’t want to sing. The fame is just in their head, say omo I go blow,” said Bella Shmurda. “ Yes, for these persons, there must be a directorate for them. They must understand this, bro if you get here you have to do it like this, if you want to get there you have to do it like this. “Most times, all these people shout money, money, money, it is not about the money. Where is your talent? “How well can you write these songs? With your songs, what are you touching? What do you think your song will change? Like these things, they need to grow with it. “Because while I was growing up too all I was shouting is: I wan blow, I wan blow, money no dey. Yes you wan blow, but, how you wan take blow the blow? “So all these things, you know, we have to take notice. We have to start doing seminars. Up-and-coming artists come for seminars. “Yeah you have to educate these people. I think through that, they can get a better orientation. Anybody wey no wan kon sing go go and person wey fit go stay.”
