 The Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has signed a five-year agreement with the state Private Sector Participation (PSP) operators with the objective of enhancing their operational activities, boost their confidence and reassure them of government’s commitment to their sustainability. LAWMA Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni, who oversaw the signing of the agreement yesterday in Lagos, said the state was entering a new phase of waste collection and disposal and would strengthen the sector and make it manageable. The LAWMA boss enjoined the PSP operators to improve on their service delivery and in good faith repay the magnanimity of the state government by ensuring that they discharge their duties diligently.  He warned against indiscriminate dumping of refuse, stressing that the agency would strictly enforce sanitary best practices henceforth. “The idea of people dumping waste indiscriminately into drainages, water channels, the median and other unauthorised places must stop as it would be seriously frowned against and offenders prosecuted,” Odumboni warned, stating also that the agency will not tolerate non-payment of waste bills. “We will have such houses sealed and make defaulters to face the law,” the LAWMA CEO warned, appealing to Lagosians to endeavour to pay their waste bills promptly as government would not take kindly to non-payment of bills. The President, Association of Waste Managers of Nigeria (AWAMN), Mr. David Oriyomi, in his response, expressed the gratitude of the operators to LAWMA for the milestone recorded in the signing of the agreement.
