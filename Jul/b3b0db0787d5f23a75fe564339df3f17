BBNaija Lockdown finalist, Neo has said he never attempted to apologise to Prince for many of the utterances that hurt him. Neo confessed this to Ebuka, the host of the BBNaija Reunion show, at the last episode on July 1, 2021. This is coming after Prince had labeled Neo a snitch and a snake, who he adored like a brother until after the show. Neo claimed to have tried reaching out to Prince but never got the opportunity to have the conversation. He said he placed calls through to Prince but never got answered. However, Prince denied the claims, saying he chatted with Neo and he never brought up the conversation. When Ebuka asked if Prince saw Neo’s missed calls, he denied saying he doesn’t have his mobile contacts and when Ebuka asked Neo if Prince chatted him up, he denied saying they don’t chat. The episode ended with Prince insisting he has no relationship with Neo aside from cordial relationship which exists among all other ex-housemates.
