Five farmers have been killed in Ali Ugwele, an Ekoli-Edda community in Afikpo South local council of Ebonyi State. Sources said they were  killed by assailants from neighbouring Erei village in Biasa local council of Cross River State. Ekoli-Edda and Erei have been at daggers drawn over the ownership of a palm tree plantation on the parcel of land separating them. Chairman of Afikpo South council Dr. Eni Uduma Chima said there were efforts to secure the people of Ekoli-Edda. He called for calm, stressing that the dispute has been reported to the National Boundary Commission, and that the “Commission will take urgent steps to conclude with the boundary matter and carry out the needed tracing and demarcation which will bring permanent peace in the area”. It was learnt that the  Ebonyi State government will  write to the General Officer Commanding 82 Div of the Army to deploy soldiers permanently in the area.
