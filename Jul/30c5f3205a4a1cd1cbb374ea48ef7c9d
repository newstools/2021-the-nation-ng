Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Monday arrested a gang of suspected criminals, who harass motorists and road users in traffic. The suspects met their waterloo on Monday morning while attempting to unleash terror on a motorist around Ojota in-bound Alausa. Help however came for the motorist as Governor Sanwo-Olu’s convoy approached the scene to rescue him from the three machete-wielding criminals who were at the time, trying to forcefully drag him out of his vehicle. The security personnel attached to the Governor swooped on the suspects, retrieved the dangerous weapons from them and arrested the three of them.  The state Environmental and Special Offences Unit also seized 104 motorcycles for allegedly plying restricted routes. The agency said it impounded the motorcycles at Second Rainbow, Amuwo Odofin, Cele Bus Stop and Okota areas of the state. A statement by the Public Affairs Officer (PAO), Femi Moliki said the agency’s chairman, CSP Shola Jejeloye, led the operation aimed at halting the flagrant abuse of traffic laws by motorcyclists. He said the government was concerned about the recklessness of motorcyclists on restricted routes, adding that it became necessary to help the bikers by saving their lives and those of other road users.
