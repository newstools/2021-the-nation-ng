President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulates development expert, scholar and author, Dr. Charles Akindiji Akinola, on today’s celebration of his 65th birthday. In a statement yesterday in Abuja by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, President Buhari rejoiced with Akinola’s family and friends on the occasion marked with years of research on growth of public and private institutions, and nations. He felicitated with the scholar whose contributions to development cuts across shaping public policy, private sector consulting and civil society engagements, working variously with state governments, Federal Government agencies and multilateral institutions, like the World Bank, USAID, UK Department for International Development and Ford Foundation.  “As the development expert turns 65, the President believes his rich pedigree with the private and public sectors will always be relevant, particularly as the world focuses more on re-thinking and re-jigging development policies to favour inclusiveness and ownership. “President Buhari prays for longer life, good health and strength for Dr. Akinola as he serves his state, Osun and the country,” the statement added.
