The first athletes have arrived at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Village, which has officially been opened by organisers in Japan’s capital city. National delegations have also been able to enter the Village to prepare for the arrival of their respective athletes. Athletes were dropped off and entered the Village at a location inaccessible to the media. The low-key nature of the arrivals was underlined by traditional welcome ceremonies for teams being cancelled. Tokyo 2020 claimed the cancellation of the media opportunities and welcome ceremonies came as part of simplification measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  “The athletes are grateful that these Olympic Games are happening under these circumstances, and that all measures are being taken to deliver safe and secure Games,” International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said. The Village is located at the Harumi waterfront district of Tokyo, around six kilometres from the National Stadium. The complex features 21 residential buildings and 3,800 condos. Around 18,000 athletes and officials are expected to stay at the Village during the Olympics. Athletes have been instructed to arrive no earlier than five days prior to their competition and leave no later than two days after their event concludes. The restrictions are part of measures designed to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19, although organisers are yet to confirm what the expected capacity of the Olympic Village will be during the Games.
