A sport fiesta organised by Barcelona footballer Asisat Oshoala will hold between tomorrow and next Monday at the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos. The para-soccer championship and Girls’ Football Competition are co-sponsored by president of African Children’s Talent Discovery Foundation (ACTDF), Noah Dallaji, an engineer. Oshoala, who spoke with reporters in Lagos, on the vision behind her foundation, said she was passionate about the education and welfare of the girl-child. She said: “I am passionate about the girl-child. I knew how I started. The goal of my foundation is to target and assist the girl-child, motivate and support them to reach their goals. “God has blessed our foundation with the support of Engineer Noah Dallaji. He has advised me not to make charity work a gender affair.” Lauding Oshoala, the ACTDF president said no nation can exist without young people who are fu of energy, vigour and zest. He said the lesson of #EndSARS protests should instruct stakeholders to steer the youths to productive venues, values and virtues. Dallaji, who recently organised a football competition and soccer mentoring exercise for youths in Bauchi, capital of Bauchi State, said “talents can be discovered from all angles.” He added:”We need to continue to discover talents. 37 young people will be send by our foundation to an academy in Europe to develop their talents in soccer. “We were born in different ways and for different purposes. It is a joint responsibility to make Nigeria a happy place. Some talents abound in the rural areas. “They must be discovered. They are looking for a platform to excel. We must go and discover them and give them opportunities.”
