Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Kwara has uncovered a large number of herdsmen allegedly trying to set up an illegal camp in the Bode Saadu area of the state. Corps spokesman Babawale Afolabi said the strange settlers were on the verge of setting up the camp at Bode Sadu Muslim praying ground. “On Tuesday this week our men in Bode Saadu on routine surveillance discovered the suspected alien herdsmen at Bode Saadu praying ground who were trying to set up a settlement in the area,” Afolabi said yesterday. But Civil Defence personnel in the area quickly rounded them up, he added, saying that the herders would be handed over to the appropriate authorities for profiling and background check. He urged members of the public to alert security agencies of any strange faces and people of questionable characters in their area. Afolabi also revealed that the command intercepted 50 jerry-cans of adulterated petroleum products on Kosubosu Road in Baruten local government area of the state. He said that the products were about to be taken out of Nigeria.
