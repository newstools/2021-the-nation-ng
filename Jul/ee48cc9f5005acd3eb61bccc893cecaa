Markets in Akokoland comprising four local government areas of Ondo State are to be closed on Friday, July 9, to honour late Prophet Temitope Joshua. Late Prophet TB Joshua hails from Arigidi in Akoko Northwest local government area. The decision to close all markets was agreed on by all Iyalaje and Iyalojas in Akokoland. A statement signed by the Iyalaje of Ikare Akoko, Alhaja Risikat Mohammed, said there was no sacrifice too big for them to make for late TB Joshua for his love, selfless and humanitarian services to the people. Alhaja Mohammed who urged traders and shop owners, to adhere strictly to the directive said they want to virtually participate in the burial programmes on Emmanuel Television owned by Synagogue Church of All Nations. Chairman of Akoko Northwest local government, Elder Ayodele Akande, said adequate security has been put in place owing to the number of visitors trooping to Arigidi. Elder Akande said the mass participation of the people in the burial activities of TB Joshua was to pay their last respect to the man that showed them love. Akande said, “We have put necessary security measures in place. Men of the Amotekun corps have been mobilised. “What the man stood for cannot be quantified. The only 18-seater bus being used in the council was provided by him. He ensured established of a military base here which is why we have not been experiencing crimes in this area of Akoko. “After I was sworn in, he visited my office. Last Christmas, he gave 350 bags of rice to the workers and added N500,000. He improved road network and cared for the elderly.”
