CAPELLO, one of the most-winning coaches of all time and a former England boss, previewed the game in an interview with Il Corriere dello Sport. “Italy can make it, England are an interesting team, not yet a top team,” the 75-year-old said. “They don’t have much quality in midfield, but they are physically strong and aggressive. And they have the only European centre-forward, Harry Kane.” The Three Lions needed a penalty in the extra time to beat Denmark in the semis. “They suffered Denmark’s pressing the other day, but they coped with their positioning,” Capello claimed. Italy beat Austria, Belgium and Spain in the knock-out phase after three wins from three in the group stage. “Italy have impressed me for their unity and desire to help each other,” the former Milan, Roma and Real Madrid coach claimed. “There’s no egoism in the team. Roberto [Mancini] had done an extraordinary job. Italy have the best goalkeeper in the world, England not quite. Ask Ancelotti about Pickford.” Ancelotti was appointed Real Madrid coach earlier this summer, coached the English goalkeeper at Wembley. Many pin the blame on the 27-year-old for Denmark’s opening goal against England on Wednesday, while Donnarumma pulled off crucial saves in each one of Italy’s three knock-out stage games. “Italy were forced to play with Catenaccio against Spain, they dominated with their pace and pressing.”
