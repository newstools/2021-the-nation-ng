Singer Simi has recounted how beautiful and pure little kids are although eventually they become worse as they grow older and mingle with things and people in the world. According to Simi, one of her favourite things about babies and little kids is how they are not trying to prove anything to anybody or seek validation from anyone. The mother of one explained when babies like you, it’s simply genuine as they would show it to you and vice versa, noting that they never portray fake love. Simi added that kids can’t be bribed with money or gifts and if you buy them luxurious toys, they would rather play with the toys, never attempting to outdo anyone but simply being themselves. The singer also stated that little kids stay contented with whatever they are given as long as they know you love them. However, the “Duduke” crooner explained that all these change when they grow older as they begin to be learn and portray wickedness, envy, racism etc losing their ones precious and purest hearts.

One of my fave things about babies/little kids is how they’re not trying to prove anything to anybody. “If they like you, you, if they don’t care for you, you know. No fake love for the gram lol. “You can’t bribe them with money or big gifts. If you buy them designer, they’d rather play with the carton. They’re not trying to outdo, outdress, outswag, outbe anybody. They just are. “When u see a lil child all swaggy, it’s mostly for the parents. These babies are happy to play around in the simplest thing as long as they’re not too cold or warm. As long as they’re fed and they know you love them, they’re content. “This is why their hearts are most precious to God. Purest. “It’s so crazy that we all start out this way. This doggone world out to get us the minute we land. The older we get, the worstest (sic) we get. Racism, fear, envy, wickedness is taught/learnt. It’s really fucked up.”
