Kwara Assembly has suspended its only Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) member Hon Jimoh Agboola over alleged contempt and abuse of privilege. Agboola represents Ilorin South Constituency. The decision of the Assembly is sequel to a motion moved by the House Leader Abubakar Olawoyin at plenary. Olawoyin, while leading the debate on the motion, said the Assembly is an institution and must be respected. He accused Agboola of making a disparaging comment against the House by calling on the masses to stage a protest against the Government and Assembly on a radio programme. He regarded such act at this period of insecurity as unsafe, warning it could lead to chaos. Olumide Ayokunle (Isin Constituency) said derogatory languages against the Assembly should not be condoned especially when such language is found out to be false. He urged the House to make proper investigation on the matter before any action could be taken. Speaker Yakubu Danladi directed its Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Judiciary to conduct investigation on the matter and reports its finding to the House as soon as possible. He also directed Agboola to stop attending plenary pending conclusion of the investigation. But the lawmaker said his suspension would not stand, stating “my suspension is dead on arrival. I will soon make my next move known.”
