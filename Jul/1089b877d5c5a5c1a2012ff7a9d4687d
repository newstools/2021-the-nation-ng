Heavyweight prospect Efe Ajagba believes his fight with Cuba’s Frank Sanchez on July 24 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will be a special ‘Night’ for his fans and critics alike. The former Olympian will face his fellow undefeated opponent in what many believe will be the undercard fight of the night outside Tyson Fury’s highly-anticipated third fight with Deontay Wilder. Ajagba, currently ranked at No 9 by the WBC, can take a big step towards a heavyweight title fight with a victory over Sanchez, who sits at No 13 in the same rankings. Undefeated in 15 fights with 12 ending via knockouts, Ajagba last fought in April in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and knocked out Brian Howard with a single right hand in the third round, a contender for ‘Knockout of the year’. The Delta state-born pugilist turned pro in July 2017 and soon established himself as one of the division’s fiercest one-punch knockout artists. “I have been patiently waiting for this opportunity to showcase my skills,” Ajagba said about the forthcoming bout. “My fans and critics can expect to see more jabs, head movement, footwork and power in both hands against Frank Sánchez. “July 24 is going to be a special night for ‘The One and Only’ Efe Ajagba,” he added.
