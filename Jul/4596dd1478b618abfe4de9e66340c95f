Championship rivals West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City are both in the race for Liverpool striker Taiwo Awoniyi with the German side Mainz also interested in signing the 23-year-old. As per the same report, the Nigerian has finally qualified for a UK work permit after playing out on loan in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium since he signed for Liverpool way back in 2017. However, his seven spells out on loan have not improved his first-team chances at Anfield and the two Championship sides could be about to take advantage of this latest development on his work permit, with Liverpool likely to be willing to negotiate a cut-price deal for the 23-year-old to get him off the wage books. After an unsettled six years at the club, Awoniyi is also likely to want a permanent move away to a location where he can settle down, whether that’s in England or Germany.  Mainz could have the edge on their Championship competitors, with the Nigerian spending time with the German club in the 2019/20 campaign. But after coming to England and waiting for so long to get clearance to play – a fresh start in the Midlands may be a preferable option for a man who has unfinished business in this country. Also, Leeds United are keen on signing Huesca midfielder Kelechi Nwakali this summer, according to The Athletic. Watford are also monitoring the Nigerian international who started his career at Arsenal, and he is keen on returning to England for another chance to impress after failing to break into the Gunners first-team.
