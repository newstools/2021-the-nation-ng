The Lagos State Judicial Panel probing police brutality has received the autopsy reports of all 99 corpses recovered from different parts of Lagos and deposited at the Lagos morgue between October 20 and 27, 2020. A consultant pathologist to the Lagos State Government, Professor John Obafunwa, presented the post mortem results and Compact Discs of the bodies to the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led panel. The exhibits contained in two nylon bags- blue and white – were admitted in evidence by the panel after the counsel to some EndSARS protesters, Mr Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika (SAN) moved for the documents to be admitted. There was no objection from other parties before the panel. Obafunwa’s presentation followed his invitation by the panel to assist in its investigation of the Lekki Tollgate incident of October 20, 2020. Following his maiden testimony on June 5, 2021, the panel made an order for the Professor of Medicine, anatomic and forensic pathologist as well as Head of Department, Morbid Anatomy at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital College of Medicine (LASUTHCOM), to produce the autopsy reports. The Chairman of the panel made the order after the pathologist testified that the coroner’s office conducted autopsies on 99 bodies during the period. Obafunwa had also testified that three of the 99 bodies were said to have been recovered in the Lekki area. The identities of all three male victims are unknown. No fewer than 14 petitioners have accused the Army and Policemen of shooting several protesters dead and injuring several during the #EndSARS protests against police brutality. The army, which entered a defence denying the allegation, failed to honour subsequent summons requiring it respond to further questions by petitioners. Proceedings at the panel are ongoing.
