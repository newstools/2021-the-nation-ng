Super Eagles centre-back Leon Balogun was on target in Rangers pre-season encounter against Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal on Saturday. Balogun found the back of the net as Rangers played out a 2-2 draw against Arsenal in their pre-season clash at the Ibrox. The Super Eagles defender put Steven Gerrard’s men ahead in the 14th minute, heading past Arthur Okonkwo in Arsenal’s goal following a corner kick from James Tavernier. Okonkwo has now conceded two goals in his first two games for the Gunners first team. The teenage goalkeeper was handed a start despite his mistake against Hibernian, but he could do nothing to prevent Balogun’s opener. However, it did not take long for Mikel Arteta’s men to get back on levelled terms, with their new signing Nuno Tavares capitalising on an error from Tavernier to finish past Allan McGregor in the 23rd minute. It stayed level at half-time, but 15 minutes from time, Rangers took the lead once again through Cedric Itten, who rose highest to head home a cross from Glenn Middleton. But Eddie Nketiah’s strike eight minutes later ensured both teams had to settle for a draw.
