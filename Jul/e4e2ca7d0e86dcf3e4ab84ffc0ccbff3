In order to help alleviate the suffering of Nigerians, especially the less privileged who could not afford medical care, Rotary club will build an International Cancer center in Nigeria. The new 13th District Governor of Rotary International District 9125, Rotarian Ayoola Oyedokun disclosed this in Abuja while briefing reporters on activities lined up for the New Year of Rotary International. Oyedokun said plans are on to build the international cancer center in either Ibadan or Abuja especially for the less privileged who could not afford medical care. While complimenting the government’s efforts, he said: “We are going to also train oncologists in the areas that will help the cancer treatments and diagnoses in Nigeria rather than traveling abroad”. Both local and international medical experts, Oyedokun said, will be assembled to be on medical missions. His words: “We have helped in the eradication of polio in Nigeria. August last year, Nigeria and Africa were certified as a polio free country. We are going to intervene in the area of water and sanitation. One of the big and better projects that we have penciled down is the provision of an international cancer treatment center in any of the facilities that are available for us to provide. And we are in partnership with other Rotarians across the world.” “We will not have to be travelling to have diagnoses of cancer. It is not something that we can do in all the six geopolitical zones. We are going to take it one at a time. We are already working to see if the facility is going to be in Abuja or Ibadan. We are going to do surgeries, and eye interventions for those that have glaucoma. It will not be a one-off thing. We are going to follow up to ensure that after the treatment you are totally taken care of.”
