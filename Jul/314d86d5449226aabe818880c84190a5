Police in Calabar, the Cross River State capital, have taken a man into custody for alleged possession of a human skull. Michael Morris Bassey, 45, a self-confessed prophet and founder of Victory is Sweet Ministries, was reportedly found with a skull in a wooden box at his church pulpit. Commissioner of Police Sikiru Akande paraded him yesterday along with 30 other suspects for sundry alleged crimes. The Nation gathered that Bassey was arrested upon a petition from a lady he allegedly attempted to hypnotise with fetish powers. A picture of the lady was found in the prophet’s possession tied to the human skull. Some charms were also seen in the box. Bassey admitted that he founded Victory is Sweet Ministries, which is not registered, but  denied knowing anything about the skull and other items found in his possession. “It was my mother that gave me a Bible and a garment as a young boy, and then I started helping people by liberating them from various curses, evil attacks and enchantments,” he said. He said he was neither a herbalist nor fetish priest but a prophet. CP Akande urged residents to be vigilant.
