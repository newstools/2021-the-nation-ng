The John Goldana Campaign Organisation has described the just-concluded All Progressives Congress (APC) primaries for local government elections in Kanke Local Government Area as not only a rape of democracy, but also a complete charade orchestrated by enemies of democracy to achieve their selfish goals. Its Director-General, Zumji Lazarus, disagreed with the outcome of the exercise, insisting that it must be cancelled for the interest of justice and fair play. He said: “Our concern is the recent process adopted for the primaries for Kanke LGA Chairmanship candidate. As far as we are concerned, the process is a complete charade and a rape on democracy.” He further stated that “we have been compelled to address the press following the recent primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in respect of the forthcoming local government elections which cannot be said to be credible and transparent in most of the state electoral wards in the state.” He  recalled that “just like in other LGAs, a 20-man committee was set up by the party to parley with chairmanship aspirants from Kanke with a view to coming up with three consensus candidates as stipulated in the party’s guidelines. “The Committee met from June 13 to 14 2021 and interfaced with the nine aspirants but no consensus was arrived at as all the aspirants said they would prefer to go for primaries and promising that they would co-operate with whoever emerged as the chairmanship candidate.
