Arigidi, hometown of late founder of Synagogue Church for All Nations (SCOAN) Prophet Temitope Joshua, was like a ghost town Friday as commercial activities were grounded. Schools and markets were shut as residents trooped to his country home’s residence to virtually participate in the burial of Prophet Joshua. Many were moved to tears as they watched the event beamed live from Lagos State. Residents from other neighbouring Akoko communities in four local government areas, including Muslims and politicians attended. The early heavy rainfall did not deter the people from paying last respects to a man they described him as their benefactor. Those who spoke urged both the state and federal government to immortalise him. Chief Imam of Arigidi/Agbaluku Central mosque, Alhaji Salisu Musa, said the Muslim community was very sad about his death because TB Joshua never discriminated against them. He said: “TB Joshua has been the person helping me. You know I am not paid for being an Imam. Prophet Joshua bought me the current car I am using despite the religious differences. “He believes we are one. He never discriminated when sharing palliatives for the downtrodden. Irrespective of religion, he would help without hesitating. He also gave me the personal house I now stay.”
