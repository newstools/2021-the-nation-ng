David ‘Davido’ Adeleke has broken his silence on the death of one of his aides, Habeeb Uthman aka Obama DMW. Davido broke his silence seven days in faraway Atlanta after the death of Obama DMW, where he has been with other members of the 30BG and DMW. Davido, in a short video stepping out in Atlanta, said “R.I.P 44.” The Nation had reported that Obama DMW died of suspected heart failure on Tuesday, June 29, 2021, after he complained of breathing issues. Obama reportedly drove himself to the hospital for a medical check-up and died during the tests. Members of the DMW and 30BG have been left in shambles over the death of Obama. Reigning acts like Tiwa Savage have also been mourning the death of the late Obama. Obama was buried according to Islamic rights in the Epe area of Lagos State on Wednesday.
