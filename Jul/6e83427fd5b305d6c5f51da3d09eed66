Wife of Lagos State Governor Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu has called for a return to community-based system where the welfare of every child is the responsibility of parents and guardians. She spoke when she hosted Muslim sisters to a one-day seminar at the State House in Alausa, Ikeja. The seminar’s theme was: Women, obedience: Nexus for a successful home and nation building. She believes inculcating the right values in children and youths at community level remained one of the solutions to rising insecurity in the country. According to her, parents mut embrace the system where every mother cares about children. She said: “…we need to go back and check where we got it wrong. The angry youths out there were birthed by women. The question is where did we go wrong? Why are they so annoyed with the system and then fighting us? “So, it is apt that we talk to our women in various organisations. It is important that we look back and retrace our steps, and look at what corrections we can give from the home front.” Mrs. Sanwo-Olu recalled how people used to care for all children within the community, saying it was important more than before to go back to the system where what affects one, affects all. “In those days when we were much younger, every mother was a mother to every child in the community, that was how it used to be…’ The governor’s wife explained that the seminar was designed to bring Muslim sisters up to speed with skills and information to help them contribute to a peaceful society and national development. Chief Imam of Lagos Sheikh Sulaimon Abou-Nola noted that women must be well educated, financially independent, of good character, morally upright, prayerful and know their rights if they must contribute to national development. The seminar also featured lectures on violence against women, work/life balance, and others.
