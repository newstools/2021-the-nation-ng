The Federal Government has assured detained leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu will get fair hearing. Minister for Information and Culture Lai Mohammed, in a briefing in Abuja, told all those seeking justice for Kanu the suspect will get a fair trial. “It is interesting that many are suddenly calling for a fair trial for Kanu as if he didn’t get one before he decided to jump bail and flee. “However, I can assure you that the fair deal that Kanu denied many of the victims of the violence which he willfully instigated through his broadcasts and tweets will not be denied him.”
