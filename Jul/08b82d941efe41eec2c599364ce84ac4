 Markets in Akoko landÂ  comprising four local government areas of Ondo State are to be closed on Friday in honour of the late Founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Temitope Balogun Joshua. He hailed from Arigidi in Akoko Northwest Local Government Area. The decision to close the markets was agreed on by all Iyalajes and Iyalojas in Akokoland. A statement signed by the Iyalaje of Ikare-Akoko, Alhaja Risikat Mohammed, said there was no sacrifice too big for them to make for the late Joshua for his love, selfless and humanitarian services to the people.  Alhaja Mohammed, who urged traders and shop owners, to adhere strictly to the directive, said they want to virtually participate in the burial programmes on Emmanuel Television owned by Synagogue Church of All Nations. Chairman of Akoko Northwest Local Government, Elder Ayodele Akande, said adequate security has been put in place owing to the number of visitors trooping to Arigidi. Elder Akande said the mass participation of the people in the funeral activities was to pay their last respect to the man that showed them love.
