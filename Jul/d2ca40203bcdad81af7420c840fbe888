When courage falls into short supply Chivalrous stones will rise And shame timid seasons With a hard, intrepid query   When elephants of the jungle Block their ears to the grumblings Of a trampled earth, fallen leaves Will spring a carpet of thorns   The savannah has no hiding place For the fury of the harmattan blaze But a serpentine stream below the mountain Knows the answer for the raging bully   Wisdom lives in the silence Between thunder’s pervasive clamour The thief who steals the King’s trumpet Must also steal a palace for its royal blast   I speak, therefore, I am I breathe through my words My tongue the faithful priest In the temple of my mouth  Head over shoulders Hands swinging on both sides Send courage on an errand And watch it return with daring gifts
