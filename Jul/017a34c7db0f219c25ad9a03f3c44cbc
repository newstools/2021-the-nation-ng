 The Bank of Industry (BoI) has partnered with the Ondo State government on $20 million Covid-19 relief scheme that would enable both parties salvage over 5,000 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) from the negative impact of the pandemic  and eradicate poverty. At the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at the Ondo State Governor’s Office, Akure, BoI Regional Head, Southwest, Michael Oye, said the event marked formal enlistment of the state in the Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (NG-CARES) programme. According to him, it is a tripartite programme of the World Bank, Federal Government and state governments that utilises existing Federal Government platforms. The scheme targets existing and newly emerging vulnerable and poor households, agricultural value chains and Micro Small and Medium (MSMEs) affected by the economic crisis sequel to COVID-19 outbreak. According to Oye, the amount of money to be disbursed to the beneficiaries varies based on their areas of specialisation and the sector in which they are working as MSMEs. He revealed that the state subscribed to two of the three Disbursement Link Indicators (DLI) available in RA-3, which he listed as credit support for working capital requirements (DLI3.1) and subsidised operational cost support (DLI3.2). To ensure success of the programme, he also revealed that there is a robust feedback mechanism to evaluate and monitor the scheme.

While lauding the organisation for partnering with the state, Odu added that the programme would tremendously assuage the suffering of the people and set the state’s economy on the path of speedy recovery.
