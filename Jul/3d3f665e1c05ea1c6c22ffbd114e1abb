Screen siren, Moyo Lawal has revealed how she almost went off social media following a series of events in recent times. The curvy actress disclosed how she had two accidents within a very short period of time and also had her trip to South Africa canceled without prior notice. “I wanted to go on a social media break because I was so sad but who will be annoying you people and causing sweet trouble like this? So I refused,” said Lawal. “I am sad, come and pet me ooooh or just give me another movie role in a different country. I have had a series of unfortunate events this week. “First I had two very unnecessary accidents. The first one, I don’t know what my driver was thinking, maybe he was exhausted sha, it was really late. “The second one, we were parked (no one was in the car, we were filming) then this drunk (I assume) person bashed us really badly. Then, I wake up with the ugliest bruise on my thigh (I have no idea how it got there), it’s almost gone now sha. Thank God I fasted. “Then bruising my toe, I can’t remember the other little things again,” she concluded her narration of the two minor accidents. Moyo further disclosed how she missed a movie role in South Africa saying, “However, the one that broke the camel’s back. I should have been on my way to film an amazing movie in South Africa that I cleared my entire schedule for the next two weeks for (to think, I sacrificed two juicy films for this movie), but flights were cancelled out of Nigeria with no warning. “The annoying thing is that my passport is left with just a few months (if you have less that 6 months on your passport by the way, just go and renew it now) so the producer (who, I can’t even start to imagine what he is going through by now), because the entire production had to be put on hold because of the lockdown situation in South Africa, so sorry sir had to go an extra mile, to ensure I got my visa.”
