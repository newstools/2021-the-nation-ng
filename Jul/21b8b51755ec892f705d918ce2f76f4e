In a bid to fight the increasing wave of insecurity in the country, All Progressives Congress (APC) controlled states are to strengthen the legal framework for the implementation of the Security Trust Fund (STF) by member States. This decision was reached at the 12th Quarterly meeting of Secretaries to Government of APC states in conjunction with the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) in Lafia, Nasarawa State capital. The communique, jointly signed by the Nasarawa State Secretary to Government, Barr. Muhammad Ubandoma Aliyu and the Director-General of PGF, Salihu Moh. Lukman, issued at the end of the meeting and released to newsmen in Abuja on Saturday stated that States Chief scribes will continue to mobilize resources for the management of security challenges in the APC-controlled states. The STF was fashioned after the Lagos State model which was adopted by State Speakers and Attorney Generals of APC States as a vehicle to raise funds through a joint contribution of 1 percent of the statutory income of the government and private concerns in each state towards taking care of security challenges. The SSG in their communique also resolved to strengthen the Security Committees at the Local Government Levels and ensure that all stakeholders, especially traditional and religious take more responsibility and are made to be more accountable to the government in responding to security challenges. They also resolved to strengthen regular processes of information sharing on issues of security management among APC controlled States to facilitate synergy of initiatives and proactive responses; Commending the effort of the Federal Government at addressing the festering insecurity in the country, the Scribes hailed the renewed offensive by Nigerian Security Agencies against criminal elements across the country. The meeting further reaffirmed the APC State governmentâ€™s commitment to continue to work with the Federal Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that every part of Nigeria is safe.
