Catfish Farmers Association of Nigeria (CAFAN) said plans are on to commence production of locally-made feeds for fish farmers. The association said this during a retreat in Sango, Ogun State. National Vice President II cum Southwest Zonal Chairman of the association, Prince Sunday Samuel, said the persistent increase in the price of feeds has negatively affected the performance of fish farmers and needs to be curtailed.  “As farmers, we are faced with operational guidelines in the business, lack of funds, and skyrocketing rise of feeds. Feeds account for almost 85 per cent of the cost of production. The high rising of feeds is a challenge for our association. We don’t want to be going to the government every time, hence pulling resources together and start producing our own feeds,” he said. Ogun State Chairman of CAFAN Mr Samuel Olubodun, appealed to the government to come to their aid on the issue of the flood. Women Director of CAFAN Dr. Olayinka Odusanya, called on the government to invest in the production of feeds to complement the effort of farmers.
