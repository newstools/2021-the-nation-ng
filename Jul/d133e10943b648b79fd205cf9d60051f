A yet-to-be identified girl was killed by stray bullet at the Yoruba Nation rally held at Ojota Park, Lagos on Saturday. The protest, which started with singing and chanting, got rowdy as security operatives shot in the air, and also teargassed protesters. The lifeless body of the girl was crowded by sympathisers at the scene. A resident who pleaded anonymity told The Nation, when the protest went rowdy, the girl was about to open the shop when the stray bullet hit her. Police visited the scene of the incident, and took her dead body away.
