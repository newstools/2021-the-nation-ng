 Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has inaugurated independent monitors of National Social Investment Programmes in the state. Oyetola, who inaugurated the monitors yesterday at the Staff Development Centre, State Government Secretariat, Abere, Osogbo, said the administration had earned several accolades for its exceptional performance on social intervention programmes implementation. He stated that the state had shown consistency in the implementation of a wide array of social protection programmes, which, according to him, have continued to impact significantly on the lives of the citizens. Oyetola, who was represented at the inauguration ceremony by the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, noted that the administration’s relentless efforts in the last two and half years had earned it the pride of place as a leading state on the Human Development Index.  “Only recently, we commenced the feeding of 30,000 persons who are poor and are vulnerable monthly as part of our unique way of cushioning the effect of the current economic challenges on the poor and vulnerable in our state,” Oyetola said. In her remark, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiyah Umar Farouq, said the flag-off of the training of 5000 Independent Monitors was aimed at complementing the quick actualisation of the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) created by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016. The minister, who was represented by the Director, Finance and Administration, Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Mr. Matthew Dada, said the initiative would further help to strength the existing partnership and mutual recognition of the need to do more on the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP).
