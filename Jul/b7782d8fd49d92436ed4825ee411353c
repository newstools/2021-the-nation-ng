Travel management company, Wakanow, has opened an experience centre  in Jubilee Mall, Admiralty Way, Lekki, Lagos. The new office, according to the travel company,  is part of its strategy to position itself to deliver  satisfactory consumer  experience. According to the company, the  COVID-19 pandemic   heavily impacted the travel and tourism industry particularly in 2020, at the peak of global lock downs with most countries closing their borders to non-essential travel, forcing airlines to heavily reduce capacity globally. To weather the shocks occasioned by the pandemic,  the company said it deployed  a  hybrid model as an  offline and online agency to  solidify its   massive investment  in technology , which has helped it to drive the sustainability of business in the intervening period. The company said it was the only travel agency running 24/7 customer service centre operations which enabled it to take care of teeming customers during the upheaval in flight operations. Speaking in an interview, its  Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bayo Adedeji, said: “Wakanow was able to weather the pandemic storm due to its innovative approach in the development of new complementary products and the unwavering commitment of its staff to  customers’’.
