Singer Davido has unveiled the new nickname of his son, Ifeanyi Adedeji Adeleke Jnr, during private time with him in his Banana Island residence. In two viral videos, both were seen together having some “father and son” moments. In the videos, little Ifeanyi could be seen rocking his father’s face cap just the way American hip hop stars rock theirs with the back actually placed in front. At different times, the DMW boss removed the cap from his son’s head and placed it back almost immediately with the little one enjoying the games on his tablet. At that point, the doting father said: “Gangster P.”
