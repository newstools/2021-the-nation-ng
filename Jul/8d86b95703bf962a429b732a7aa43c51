Nigerian rapper and YBNL boss, Olamide Adedeji, aka Olamide, has said his experience as a street hustler motivates him to always support rising stars. The record label executive made this revelation during his recent interview with Apple Music’s Africa Now Radio. “Bro, I went through hell before I got here. But, now, I’m here. If I have any opportunity to bring up anyone that I know, then I would do anything to make sure that person makes it.” On his latest body of work, ‘UY Scuti’, Olamide said it was just an experimentation of his craft. “I mean from way back, the regular thing I used to do was just rap music, street music. This time round, I’m just switching the gears and moving it up a notch, a little bit. Because I’ve always wanted to tap into different elements of everything I feel on the inside, and just live my life to the fullest. “So, I might as well just try something new entirely. And I’m happy for having the courage to be able to tap into something new entirely, that I’ve never done before. It feels like a full-time pop project, and I’m happy I’m doing it because I’ve always wanted to.”
