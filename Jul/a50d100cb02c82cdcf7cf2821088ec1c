The graduating students of the Badagry Local Government United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Vocational Training Center have been called upon to be employers of labour  to reduce the rate of unemployment in the local government area. The Chairman of the local government,  Olusegun Onilude made this call during the 17th graduation and matriculation  of the vocational training center which took place at the local government secretariat. Onilude challenged the graduands to believe in themselves and serve as a reward of excellence to impact their acquired skills on other residents of the council areas in order to be self sufficient and reduce the rate of unemployment in the local government. “In the light of this, all the best graduating students in the six departments of the vocational training center will be empowered with equipment to immediately set themselves up in their line of trade “, Onilude said. The council boss pointed out that at the inception of his administration in 2017 , the two vocational training centres in the local government were comatose with all the equipment either stolen or rotten. ” Because we value the importance of vocational training in the empowerment of our people, we promptly embarked on the resuscitation of the U N D P vocational training center at Ajara. The building was wholly renovated and materials for the different departments were purchased. At present , the training center has functional departments for fashion designing, catering, computer, make -up and Gele and bag making with additional two new departments created”, the chairman noted.
