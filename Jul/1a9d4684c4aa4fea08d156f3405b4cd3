A non-governmental organisation called Sports Skills and Africa Organisation recently organised a one-day seminar to rescue cardiac arrest victims in the sports arena. The group made up of professionals in various fields of human endeavours had the privilege of impacting fresh ideas to 59 sports coaches who thronged the Media Centre of the Teslim Balogun stadium in Surulere, Lagos. During the ‘operation train the trainers’ project, the group emphasised more on the need to curb the trend of sudden death through cardiac arrest which almost killed Inter Milan player, Christian Eriksen who slumped during the EURO 2020 event. The Denmark player dropped to the ground at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen just before half-time, against Finland to the distress of the players on the pitch. Medics were seen trying to stabilise the former Tottenham player, while his teammates stood in a circle around them to shield them from the cameras. The group provided participants with educational materials that could enhance player’s health and safety.
