Hundreds of fans gathered in cities across Argentina yesterday  to celebrate their team’s victorious return from the 2021 Copa America, where they beat Brazil on home turf. The match was decided by a goal midway through the first half from Angel Di Maria, who lobbed Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson following a perfect Rodrigo De Paul pass. It was the first national team  trophy for Lionel Messi as the six-time Ballon d’Or winner finally ended his long wait  after been a beaten finalist on four separate occasions with Argentina – three times in the Copa America and once in the World Cup. The Argentinian Football Association (AFA) had not planned any official celebration given the coronavirus epidemic, which had caused the country to pull out of co-hosting the tournament, which then went to even worse-hit Brazil. Messi and his team arrived home in Buenos Aires yesterday’s  morning on a private flight from Rio de Janeiro, and submitted to coronavirus tests. In two buses emblazoned with the words “Champions of America 2021” and the number 15 – for Argentina’s number of Copa America wins – the team was escorted from the airport by police as hundreds supporters gathered along the highway, waving and cheering. “Beautiful, beautiful. And thank you, because the people needed it,” exclaimed one fan, Emilio Navarro. After a quick show at the AFA headquarters in Buenos Aires, the victorious players went their different ways, without fanfare. Argentina, with a population of 45 million, has one of the highest coronavirus infection and death rates in the world, with more than 98,000 lives lost.
