What’s there to choose
Between those who remember
Too much, and those
Who remember not at all? Can Memory be
A millstone around our neck
Or that much desired stepping stone
To the House of Wisdom What happens to the Beauty Queen
Who forgets her face at home
Or the Lion with a missing mane
In the gathering of champion Cats How do we console that Orator
Who falls from the tree of words
How do we sew the rags
Of his broken syntax When Memory sleeps
It is Remembrance
That kicks it awake
Like the stick which provokes the drum Do not mock my face
With Oblivion’s fretful mask
I am not the toad in the tale
Which lost its tail and then its tribe.
