Commissioner of Police in charge of Port Authority Nasiru Mohammed has debunked reports of a gun battle between security operatives and armed thugs in Apapa. It was rumoured that there was a shootout when police went to the area to dislodge criminals. But police sources said there was no such incident around Tincan yesterday, noting that the only violence recorded was on Saturday. The Nation gathered that hoodlums engaged one another in a free-for-all on Saturday morning, with three persons injured. The warring factions were said to have hurled stones and bottles at one another on both sides of the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway. Police spokesman at the Sea Port Collins Dibie confirmed the Saturday incident, saying 16 suspects were arrested and three injured persons among those in custody. “Those injured were immediately given medical attention. I can tell you that all the 16 suspects have been charged to court. They were charged before the Apapa Magistrate’s Court,” he said.
