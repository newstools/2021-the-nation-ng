The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied the widely reported suspension of former Imo Governor Senator Rochas Okorocha for alleged “anti-party activities”. It said the purported letter of suspension addressed to Okorocha was forged. The letter was purportedly signed by APC Caretaker Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoehede. Many media organisations had reported Okorocha was suspended by the APC for alleged anti-party activities on Tuesday. But reacting to the development, APC Secretary, Senator Akpanudoehede, told The Nation the letter was fake. “The letter is fake. It is not from us (APC). My signature was forged. The signature on that letter is copy and paste,” Akpanuduoehede confirmed to The Nation. The purported two-page letter with reference number APC/NHDQ/SP/19/022/41 dated 12th July, 2021 was titled: “Re: Notification of your suspension from the All Progressives Congress (APC) for gross anti-party.” Also, a former Imo Governorship aspirant Senator Ifeanyi Araraume has debunked claims he joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). A statement by Ararume Destiny Group in a on Tuesday night said the report was untrue. It said reports that Senators Araraume and Rochas Okorocha had defected to PDP because of the face-off between them and Imo Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma were mischievous. The statement signed by Hon. Stanley Nzekwe, maintained those behind Araraume’s defection rumour are political enemies threatened by his weight and influence in Imo politics. The group vowed that Araraume would never leave APC because “he is one of the pioneer members and builders of the party in Imo State”,
