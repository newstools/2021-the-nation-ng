Chairman of Ikeja Local Government Dr. Mojeed Alabi Balogun yesterday urged residents to change the way they relate with the environment. The world, he said, is feeling the impact of climate change. Balogun, who spoke during the 14th Tree Planting Campaign at Oba Akran Way, Ikeja, urged Nigerians to heed advice from experts regarding  environments, business and health. “We do not need to wait until we are dealt with by economic conditions, health or bad environment, before we do the right thing. All projections about the impact of climate change on the earth particularly the gradual depletion of the rainforest, reinforce the need for all hands to be on deck,” he said. He explained that the tree planting, which remains the cheapest and simplest option to tackle the challenge must be embraced by all. Ojokoro LCDA Chairman Hammed Idowu D. Tijani hailed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for sustainability the exercise. “It has been proven that the world needs billions of trees annually for survival, make effort to plant yours today. Our neglect of today might turn to regrets tomorrow,” Tijani said.
