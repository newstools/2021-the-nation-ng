 Leading financial services and technology outfit, Tangerine, mid-week launched its financial service products at a press conference in Lagos. The company, which was established on September 2019, following the acquisition of 100% equity stake in Metropolitan Life Insurance Nigeria by leading private equity firm, Verod Capital Management, shared its businesses agenda and future growth plans. According to the company’s Head of Pensions, Dapo Akinsanya, the company has since completed a stream of strategic mergers and acquisitions, notably: the acquisition of ARM Life, through Metropolitan Life; culminating in the establishment of Tangerine Life Insurance Limited – the 4th largest life insurer in Nigeria; acquisition of Law Union and Rock, now rebranded Tangerine General Insurance Limited; and Assured MFB, a microfinance bank, by Tangerine Life now christened Tangerine Money. The company has also ventured into the pension space, acquiring AXA Mansard Pension and a minority stake in a significant PFA by Verod. “AXA Mansard has since been rebranded Tangerine Pensions and the process to merge the two PFAs has commenced. The merger will produce a formidable competitor with wide geographic coverage.” The company, according Akinsanya, has made significant strides, repositioning its businesses for growth by assembling a strong, agile and experienced team and “has sought to increase the minimum statutory capital levels for life insurance and general insurance businesses from N2 billion to N8 billion and N3 billion to N10 billion, respectively.” The recapitalisation process for the two insurance companies- Tangerine Life and Tangerine General, Akinsanya said, has already been concluded.
