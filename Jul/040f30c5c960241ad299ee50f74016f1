Sen Grace Bent, until now a prominent member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has formally defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Bent, who represented the Adamawa South Senatorial Zonal in the National Assembly between 2007 and 2011 under the PDP, said during a ceremony in which she was received into the APC in Yola on Saturday, that she has had enough of the PDP. “After 21 years in the PDP during which I held vital positions, I have decided, after wide consultations, to move on and to do so with progressive people, hence my decision to come into APC,” she said. Bent’s reception into the APC was attended by three state governors: Simon Lalong of Plateau State,  Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State and Muhammadu Badaru of Jigawa State. Yahaya Bello of Kogi State who was also scheduled to be in Yola for the event, was represented by his deputy, Edward Onoja. Former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, performed the function of formally ushering Grace Bent into the APC on behalf of APC caretaker Chairman, Mai Mala Buni. Nnamani congratulated Grace Bent for choosing a new political life in the APC and assured her that she would have the freedom and fair playing ground to pursue her political ambitions under the party. He said the party was glad to have her, adding that she was a crowd puller and would help the upward swing of the party in Adamawa State towards the 2023 election.
