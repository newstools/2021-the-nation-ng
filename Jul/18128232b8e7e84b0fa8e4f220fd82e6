BBNaija star Ka3na has described her husband as the ‘best man’ for her. The reality TV star, who will be 27 tomorrow, took time out to publicly profess love and eulogise her husband, Mr Jones. She posted: “I LOVE MY HUSBAND LITERALLY THE BEST MAN FOR ME… I WILL CHOOSE HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN.” Reacting to her post, social media users have practically referred to her as confused and a rolling stone. They noted she is one that claims to be married one day, separated the next day or even divorced. They have also added she is sounding all sweet today because of the gifts she hopes or has probably received from her husband. salaticEmpy2 said: “Today – I am separted. Tomorrow – I am married.
