The Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has summoned the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, over a parallel state secretariat the minister opened in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. The National Secretariat sent two letters to the minister inviting him to come and explain why disciplinary measures should not be taken against him for the action. The state headquarters of the party is located in the Tanke area; the minister’s faction recently unveiled its secretariat at GRA, Ilorin. This is coming on the heels of a threat by the State Caretaker Committee Chairman, Alhaji Samari Abubakar, to sanction the minister for anti-party activities. Abubakar told reporters in Abuja yesterday that the party may sanction the minister in line with its constitution. A source at the Secretariat told our correspondent said the party has received a report of anti-party activities against the minister. “I know that Lai Mohammed has been summoned. The Caretaker Committee sent him two letters asking him to explain the rationale behind a factional party secretariat he opened in Kwara,” the source said The party’s National Secretary John James Akpanudoedehe said he could not deny or confirm the invitation to Muhammed but added that APC leadership would not tolerate anyone who tries to divide the party at any level. Akpanudoehede said the Committee was committed to ensuring peace at all levels of the party, hence “the need to invite the Minister to interface with a committee”. “The Minister is an elder and we shall accord him the much respect and the party will not allow anything to put him to disrepute. The party on another hand will no allow anybody to violate its constitution,” the Secretary stated.
