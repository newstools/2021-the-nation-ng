THE Federal Parastatals and Private Sector Pensioners Association of Nigeria (FEPPPAN) has asked the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate to use the £26 million pension funds received from the United Kingdom to offset all outstanding pension liabilities. It also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to establish a National Health Insurance Scheme for pensioners.  They argued that the establishment of a health insurance scheme for pensioners was long overdue. The pensioners said this in a communique jointly signed by their President-General, General Secretary and National Public Relations Officer, Temple C. Ubani JP, Franklin O. Erinle and Jonathan Iyoo, at the end of its first National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Abuja. The pensioners appealed to President Buhari to ensure that the review of pensions is done as at when due according to the extant laws of the federation. The communique added: “Appeals to Pensions Transition Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) to comply with the recent directive of the Hon. Minister of Labour and Employment, and the stipulations of Trade Union Act, by ensuring that all component sectors that make up FEPPPAN have their monthly check-off dues deducted and remitted to the coffers of FEPPPAN. We thank the PTAD Executive Secretary for the gratifying news of recent receipt of £26 million pension funds from the United Kingdom. We appeal that the money be used to offset all outstanding pension liabilities.
