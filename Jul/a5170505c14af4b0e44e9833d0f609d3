Nigerian athletes to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics have been charged to be worthy ambassadors of the country by competing clean and adhering to all Covid-19 protocol. This charge was made yesterday in Abuja by the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare while bidding farewell to the first batch of athletes that departed for Tokyo. “As you are all aware, the circumstances leading to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics are unusual in many respects occasioned chiefly by the pandemic that has ravaged the entire human race. Your departure for this game is evidence that working in unison we can collectively achieve whatever we set our minds to achieve as humans.” He added: “All the athletes and officials that would feature at the games have been severally educated on Covid-19 compliance and anti-doping instructions. I urge you all to adhere to these rules in order to compete safely and avoid the discomfort of Covid-19 isolation. I enjoin you to make the nation proud at the games by competing clean and bring glory to your father’s land.” On Monday, July 12, President Muhammad Buhari will host Team Nigeria at the Presidential Villa as the Olympics-bound athletes are handed to the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC). “We are keeping to the tradition of unveiling the team to the President who will hand them over to NOC. The unveiling of the official wear/equipment will be done by Mr. President. This is a very symbolic event meant to officially sent-forth the team to the games. This should also inspire the athletes and to reinforce the fact that the Federal Government and the entire country are behind them” The Minister commended President Buhari for committing enormous resources towards Team Nigeria’s participation.
