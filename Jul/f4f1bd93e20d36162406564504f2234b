An All Progressive Congress (APC) chairmanship flag bearer in the forthcoming October 9 local government elections in Plateau State, Dayyabu Garga, has expressed optimism members of opposition parties, as well as their stalwarts, would vote for him. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, who emerged as candidate of the APC for Kanam local government area, said his track record of achievements, grassroots mobilisation, youth empowerment and philanthropic activities have endeared him to people who will regardless of party and other affiliations support his candidature anytime any day. Garga described the people of Kanam as peace-loving and one family who hardly allow political differences to divide them or cause disharmony among them. He said he opted to serve as a chairman despite being a Commissioner to serve his people better. He said he would be able to meet the yearnings of his people better as a chairman than Commissioner. As a chairman, Garga said he is the chief executive of the local government and can coordinate a lot of things and bring development to people within his allocation. As a Commissioner, he said “you are answerable to a superior and chief executive of the state and that you are responsible for the activities of the entire state and not that of a manageable area.” He said when he is elected, his first task will be to unify people and extend hands of friendship to anyone or group to jointly move the local government forward. He called on all party faithful to not only join hands with him to ensure victory at the end of the day but conduct themselves and remain peaceful before, during and after the polls. He commended Governor Simon Lalong for his steadfast leadership and good fatherly roles in the state.
