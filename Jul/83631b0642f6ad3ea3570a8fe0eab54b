Arsenal have completed the signing of Benfica left-back Nuno Tavares in a deal that could eventually be worth £8.5million. The Gunners announced on Saturday morning that Tavares has signed a long-term contract with the club. Tavares will join up with his new teammates in the coming days after he has travelled from Portugal and completed the current isolation regulations for international arrivals into the UK. He will wear the No 20 shirt. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said: “We welcome Nuno to the club. He is a young player with great promise who has developed very well with Benfica in recent seasons and has also shown his quality by being part of Portugal Under-21s. “Nuno’s arrival will give the squad extra strength and options in defence, particularly with this energy on the left side of the pitch. “We look forward to Nuno’s arrival soon, his integration into the Arsenal family and playing in front of our fantastic supporters.”
