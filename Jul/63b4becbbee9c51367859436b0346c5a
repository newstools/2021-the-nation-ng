Euro 2020 delivered a thrilling first knockout round with the elimination of Germany, Euro 2016 champion Portugal and the 2018 World Cup champion France. Quarterfinals promises great action that today Switzerland will face Spain while Belgium face a potentially much tougher opponent in Italy. Tomorrow Czech Republic will face Denmark while England is facing Ukraine, an unexpected quarter-finalist. With so many top-class games, fans will be spoilt for choice. But luckily for Nigerian fans, they will not have to make a choice, as all four matches will be shown live and in HD on StarTimes sports channels.  In what is arguably the stand-out match of the round, Belgian coach Roberto Mart√≠nez, sees his team take on Italy in the Allianz Arena in Munich. Although they struggled against Austria in the round of the last 16, Gli Azzurri have played themselves in the role of one of the favourites and despite facing the top-ranked team in the world, Italy will fancy their chances against Les Diables rouges, who beat the defending champions Portugal in the round of the last-16.
