Rangers coach Steven Gerrard has confirmed that Nigerian Nnamdi Ofoborh will be out for a short time. The young Nigerian midfielder was diagnosed with a heart issue during a regular testing. Even though there’s been no specific time for his return, it is expected that Ofoborh could spend quite a few weeks on the sidelines. Gerrard told Rangers Tv after his team’s 2-2 draw against Arsenal that Ofoborh is frustrated, but he will continue to speak to the central midfielder to help him psychologically as he goes through his recovery. “I don’t think you’ll see him in the short term, Gerrard said. “Unfortunately, something has flagged up with his ECG, which is the heart test. “The important thing is the player’s health, which we’ll obviously focus on first and foremost. “Of course it is disappointing and frustrating for the player, but I spoke to him yesterday, told him to keep smiling and be patient, and we will do everything we can to support him, get him in front of the right people and the right support, and hopefully he will be back, not too long,” he added. The Bournemouth Academy product is yet to make his long-awaited debut for his Glasgow based side after his move from the Vitality Stadium.
