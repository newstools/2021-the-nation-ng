In an interview when she visited The Nation newspaper recently, she noted the Governor has been hard working, prompting her decision to hold an event for him. According to her: “Sanwo-Olu has been working so hard, I looked at his achievement and then I said okay if they are doing two years celebration for him, let me come up with some kind of celebration for him so I came up with 104 voices for the choral group for him, you know, which was held at the Eko FM multipurpose hall on Friday which happened to be his birthday. ” Even though I didn’t know it was his birthday, it was just a coincidence so it became a double celebration and it was okay, it was fun we had 104 voices choral voices from Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education Music Department which I went to work with for this project and I had a lot of other, we had Atilogu cultural group, we had the riverine cultural group among others.” She however noted one of the highlights of the event was the rendition enacted in three major languages from Nigeria by the choral group. According to Monye, the Governor was represented at the event by Tourism Commissioner, Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf.
