Two private schools in Lekki area of Lagos have been shut over COVID-19 scare. The schools are Lagoon Girls’ Secondary School and Standard Bearer School. The Nation learnt from a source at the Office of Education Quality Assurance, Lagos State Ministry of Education that the schools were shut after reporting themselves to the ministry after which officials visited them. “From what I gathered, I do not think it was our office that discovered the schools.  The schools reported themselves.  I could not speak with the team lead that went there to give me the vivid picture of what happened when they got there,” the source said.
