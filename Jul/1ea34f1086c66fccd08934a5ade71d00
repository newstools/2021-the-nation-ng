 A 12-year-old pupil of Ado Community High School, Ado-Ekiti, Ajayi Boluwatife needs urgent assistance from well-meaning Nigerians and Ekiti State Government in order to undergo a N12million kidney surgery. Boluwatife is down with a serious kidney disease called acute Glomerulonephritis, complicated with end-stage renal failure that has shut down his kidneys, leaving him unable to pass urine. The JSS 1 student was a very lively and physically fit person until May 9, 2021 when he began to experience fever and vomiting, which forced his parents to take him to Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido Ekiti, where he was diagnosed with kidney failure.  Since then Boluwatife has been receiving treatment at the hospital where he has had several sessions of Haemodialysis but recovery has not been remarkable. His father Ajayi Gbenga, a staff member of Independent Electoral Commission, said he has been impoverished by Boluwatife’s treatment. He said he needs help in order to save his son. “Doctors said the solution is to carry out a kidney transplant for my boy and N12 million is required for the surgery,” he said. He said donation could be forwarded to First Bank—3000166967, Ajayi Gbenga Sunday. He can be reached on 08033607780 and 08136797493.
