A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos on Wednesday remanded former vice-chairman of Lagos Island Local Government Area Asekun Sakiru Kehinde in prison custody following his arraignment for allegedly exporting 1.000kg of cocaine. Justice Ayokunle Faji made the order after Kehinde pleaded “not guilty” to a one-count charge bordering on the offence. The defendant was arraigned by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on a charge marked FHC/L/99c/2021. NDLEA prosecutor Abu Ibrahim told the judge that Kehinde committed the offence on July 7, 2021, during the outward clearance of passengers on a Virgin Atlantic Airlines flight from Lagos to London-Heathrow, at the Departure Hall of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja Lagos. The court heard that the defendant, “without lawful authority exported 1.000 kilogrammes of cocaine, a narcotic drug” that is prohibited in the country. Following Kehinde’s plea, his counsel Olasupo Shasore SAN leading Chief Benson Ndakara informed the court that a bail application had been filled before the court, adding that the NDLEA had filed a reply to the said application. Mr Abu confirmed receipt of the application Mr Shasore prayed the court to admit the defendant to bail on liberal terms because the offence for which he was charged is a bailable one. But the prosecution counsel opposed him, praying the court to refuse the bail application because, according to him, of the gravity of the offence. Justice Faji adjourned ruling till July 16 and remanded the defendant in prison custody.
