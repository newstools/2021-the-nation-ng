 A new State Coordinator, Mrs Yetunde Baderinwa, has resumed at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Anambra state. Baderinwa, a native of Ondo State, who served as Deputy Director, Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development, NYSC Abuja, replaced Mr. Kehinde Aremu, who returns to the Human Resource Management Department in Abuja. Addressing management staff of the scheme at the state Secretariat, the new Coordinator said she was not unsettled on receiving her posting letter, particularly in view of the personality she was taking over from. “When this posting came out and I saw it is Anambra, I had rest of mind because I know I have a backbone. Since my arrival, I have been feeling very comfortable because I know I’m at home. This is my first time in Anambra, though I’ve passed through the state to other states.”  While assuring of a transparent and open door policy, Baderinwa solicited support from members of staff of the organisation. “All I need is your maximum cooperation so Anambra can be the pacesetter in the entire NYSC. I appreciate all of you and believe with your support we’ll go places because there’s no success without a team.” Earlier, Aremu who described his three-year tenure in the state as amazing attributed his success to the support from his entire staff, urging them to extend same Mrs. Baderinwa. “I am truly happy to have worked with all of you here. I thank you for the show of love and affection. I pray God to replenish you. I assure you that you have a brother in Abuja. Anywhere Anambra matter rises, be sure of my interventions. “Please extend the same maximum coorperation, such that whatever we achieved here will be a child’s play. We don’t say good-bye in Anambra,” he said.
