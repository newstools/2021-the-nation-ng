Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has vowed that he will never betray the state’s interests for any personal political gain. He said the successes recorded by his administration were manifestations of God’s favour, disclosing he had resisted pressure from powerful persons to betray the state. Wike spoke during the flag-off of the 5.33km Ogu-Ekporo-Kpogor-Wakama Link Road at Tende Ama, Ogu, in Ogu/Bolo Local Government Area on Friday. He acknowledged the doggedness of Ogu and Okrika women in resisting alleged rigging during the 2019 election. The Governor said he would remain eternally grateful to the women of the communities, who risked their lives and thwarted attempt to truncate the mandate of Rivers people. He said: “This is one of the local governments very strong for me. During the last 2019 election, it was historic, it is like the Aba women riot. “It was here that the women revolution started as against the military that wanted to rig us out in that election. Each time I remember, I say God thank you for using these women.” Commenting on the road project, Wike said those who thought it was impossible to construct such road forgot that God had given power to man to conquer nature. Wike promised to dredge 25 hectares of land for Ogu people and reconstruct the Eteo-Ogu road for their support to his administration. According to him, no matter how hard critics try, they will never know how he gets the money to execute projects in the state. Performing the flag-off, former Ebonyi Governor, Senator Sam Egwu, noted that political wars against Wike failed because God is with him. Egwu highlighted the importance of the virgin road that would be constructed for the people of Ogu, saying the hallmark of politics was to raise the status of the people and improve their socioeconomic well-being.
