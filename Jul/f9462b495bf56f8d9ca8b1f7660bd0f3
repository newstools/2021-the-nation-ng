 Chairman Governing Council, Lagos State Cooperative College, Mr. Oyebowale Raji, has promised that the College will partner with cooperative societies to develop the human resources in order to build efforts that will reinstate the movement to the path of growth. He made this disclosure at the weekend during the celebration of the International Day of Cooperatives, with the theme, “rebuilding better together”. While urging cooperative societies to put all hands on deck to turn around the fortunes of co-operators and cooperative movements, Raji said: “We at the College are there to partner with all our cooperative societies in jointly developing the much needed human resources for these rebuilding efforts that we may reinstate the movement to the path of growth.” According to him, this year’s theme cannot be more apt given the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of life endeavours in the last couple of months and the need for recovery through resilience and cooperation. “This event is a vibrant celebration that will enable us shake off all the shackles of the COVID-19 pandemic impact and progress forward as cooperators in order to yield the greater good for us all,” he said. He assured all corporative societies that the College will not relent in its effort at partnering with them in capacity development for the much needed human resources in the quest for growth of the Cooperative subsector of the State and Nigeria in general. The College currently offers a Professional Diploma in Cooperative Management, adding that from September, it will be admitting students into National Diploma courses in Cooperative Economics and Management, as well as in Microfinance and Enterprise Development.
