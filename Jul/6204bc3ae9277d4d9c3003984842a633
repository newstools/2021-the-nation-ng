 The Presidential Committee on Correctional Service Reform and Decongestion (PCCSRD) has lamented the inadequacy of special homes where juvenile and young offenders are kept in the country, noting that it accounts for the rise in the population of minors in the nation’s prisons. PCCSRD’s chairman and immediate past Chief Judge of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Justice Ishaq Bello called for the establishment of more of such homes known as borstals in the country. Justice Bello noted that there are only three borstals in the country which have become grossly inadequate. He spoke at a virtual meeting with justice sector officials from Ogun State on the implementation of amnesty and decongestion programme for juveniles.  Justice Bello said, ‘’In an effort to achieve our objective, the committee after visiting over 32 correctional centres in 18 states, observed that there were only three borstal institutes in Nigeria; Ogun, Kwara and Kaduna states. ‘’We found that these institutes were grossly inadequate, and over-crowded which has resulted in the ugly practice of sending juveniles to adult correctional centres. This is leaving a bad taste in the society as such juveniles are exposed to hardened criminals which in-turn negatively influences their chances of re-offending if released. ‘’To address this, the Federal Ministry of Justice in collaboration with the Committee and with the support of development partners and NGOs such as Buni Yadi Foundation has commenced the second phase of the juvenile decongestion programme with a visit to remand homes in Lagos State on the 24th -25th of May 2021.
