GARETH Southgate insists he could not be prouder to be an Englishman as he prepares to become just the second manager to lead the nation into a major tournament final. The Three Lions face Italy in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley tomorrow evening after coming from behind to see off Denmark in extra-time of their last-four clash. It will be the first time the men’s England side have played in a major final since winning the World Cup in 1966 – a gap of 55 years. Southgate will follow in the footsteps of Sir Alf Ramsey by taking charge for such an occasion and the honour has not been lost on the 50-year-old. “I guess for me it hasn’t really totally registered because I’m not reading those front pages and I’m not tuning into those bulletins,” he said when asked about bringing so much joy to the nation. “But I’m noticing the journey to the stadium – the tooting of the horns, the flags on the cars, so I’m starting to get a feel of exactly what’s going on and I suppose in the back of my mind I know what’s going on but I’ve tried to put it to one side really and keep focused on what we’re doing. “Because we’re a special country, we are historically an incredible country and I know I couldn’t be prouder to be an Englishman. “I can’t be prouder to have the opportunity to lead my country so to bring happiness at this time where it’s been so difficult for this period is a very special feeling.” If they are to win the European Championship for the first time, England will have to beat Italy – a side which has not tasted defeat since September 2018.
