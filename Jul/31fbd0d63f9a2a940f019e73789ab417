About 10 persons were injured on Monday night when traffic robbers struck in the Oke-Afa area of Ikotun-Mushin Road, Lagos. Passengers and motorists left their vehicles and scampered for safety when the robbers started shooting. The incident occurred around 9pm. The robbers, it was learnt, took the advantage of the perennial traffic gridlock on that route to unleash mayhem on the motorists and passengers. The Nation reporter, who was at the scene, said many passengers and motorists jumped from the windows and doors of their vehicles and ran away to avoid being robbed. A passenger, Afamo, said she was experiencing traffic robbery for the first time. She said: “I was in a bus heading towards Ikotun, when we got to Oke-Afa area, there was a heavy traffic snarl and the vehicles were moving at snail speed. Suddenly, we started hearing gunshots, everyone stayed put at first, but those in the vehicles ahead of ours started running backward, shouting armed robbers are raiding! “We noticed some people running out of their cars, while some jumped through the windows of the buses they boarded. It was at this moment everyone in my bus started jumping out, I was injured on my knees and hands in the process because I fell from the bus as I tried to jump down.” Other motorists called on the government to draft security operatives to the route to checkmate the activities of the criminals.
