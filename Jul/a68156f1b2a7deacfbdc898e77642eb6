 President Muhammadu Buhari is expected in Katsina today to inaugurate the multi-million naira Zobe Water Treatment plant and the newly built Dutsinma-Tsaskiya road, all in Dutsinma Local Government Area. Commissioner for Works, Housing and Transports, Alhaji Tasiu Dandagoro, announced this to The Nation in a telephone chat yesterday. He said a meeting was convened by Deputy Governor Mannir Yakubu to put finishing touches to the activities lined up for the presidential visit.  Yakubu had visited the site of the treatment plant to inspect the level of works at the project site to finalise the preparation for the inauguration by President Buhari. The Zobe Water Treatment plant was jointly financed by the Federal Government (Phase Ia & II), and the Katsina State government, which completed the phase Ib involving the laying of pipes to Karofi, K/Soli, Kankia and Charanchi areas. The water treatment plant was designed to treat and pump 75 million litres of water per day but it is currently treating and pumping 50 million litres due to poor power supply.
