The National Assembly (NASS) has hinted of plans to return the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to the nation’s seaports, noting that its continuous absence at the ports since 2011, has paved the way for substandard and prohibited goods to freely enter the country. Giving this assurance  recently was the Chairman House Committee on Industry, Mr. Enitan Dolapo-Badru. The lawmaker spoke when he led his Committee Members on an oversight function to the SON Laboratory office in Lagos. While assuring of the NASS resolve to address challenges at the ports, Dolapo-Badru noted that the continued absence of SON officials has caused havoc to the economy and the loss of lives of innocent Nigerians who use such poor quality products.  “A lot of deaths from substandard products are recorded on a daily basis in the country. Tanker explosions, building collapses, fire resulting from poor electrical and electronics products, to mention a few.” Dolapo-Badru who insisted that Act 2015 made it mandatory for SON to be at the ports, promised that his 18-member committee will do everything within their legislative powers to ensure that this anomaly is corrected. Also speaking at the occasion, Director General of SON, Malam Farouk Salim stated that despite the many challenges of the agency, SON is doing everything to ensure goods consumed in the country are of international standards.
