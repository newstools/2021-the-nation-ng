A strange disease on Friday killed seven persons and left nine others in critical conditions at the New Artisan Market, Enugu. It was gathered the bodies of the deceased, four men and three women, were discovered by shocked residents on Friday morning. Chairman of the Livestocks Market, Alhaji Danladi Abubarkar, who confirmed the incident to newsmen, said residents of the market woke up to discover the dead bodies. He said that all the affected persons, including tricycle riders, artisans and others from different households were stooling and vomiting. “We have already taken the bodies to the cemetery to bury the Muslims among them while the Christians have deposited their relations in a morgue,” he said.
