A member of the House of Representatives, Lagos Island Federal Constituency II, Kayode Akiolu has challenged youths to actively participate in the political processes as the country brace up for 2023 general election. Akiolu said this at the Youth Political Participation titled, “ Getting Ready for the 2023 Election and beyond”. organised by Change 360 Network held recently in Lagos. He said that despite making up more than 60% of the population in Nigeria, young people (ages 18-30) often find themselves marginalised from mainstream politics and decision making because in most cases they are laid back and disinterested. He noted that young people need to begin to channel their energy, creativity and aspirations to become political leaders within their communities. Akiolu lamented that the absence of youths in decision-making processes in government has created disillusionment among Nigerian youths with regards to Nigeria’s political parties and the ruling class. On the violence that often characterize our election, Akiolu said that the Nigeria electoral process is evolving and as more responsive youths join politics, things will change for the better.
