FORMER Italy boss Antonio Conte has identified a potential “weak spot” in England’s team ahead of the Euro 2020 final. England will meet the Azzurri at Wembley on Sunday, having made it to the final of a major tournament for the first time since 1966. The two sides look evenly matched, though Italy have probably had a tougher run through the knockout rounds. Where Roberto Mancini’s side have overcome Austria, Belgium and Spain, England have beaten Germany, Ukraine and Denmark in the last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively, to earn their chance to win the competition. Conte managed Italy between 2014 and 2016, coaching them at the last European Championship as they went out in the quarter-finals after losing to Germany on penalties. He has since had spells at Chelsea and Inter Milan, winning the Premier League and FA Cup at the former and Serie A with the latter.
