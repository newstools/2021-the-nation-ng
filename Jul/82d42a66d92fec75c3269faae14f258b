Chelsea forward Olivier Giroud has completed a €2 million move to AC Milan, both clubs have confirmed. The 34-year-old will wear the No.9 shirt for the Rossoneri and is understood to have signed a two-year contract with the Serie A club, with Giroud having completed his medical on Friday. The move signals the end of the forward’s spell at Stamford Bridge, where he made 119 appearances in all competitions over a four-year period. The Frenchman was held in high regard by the club and their supporters although he struggled for game time during the 2020-21 campaign, with the decision ultimately made for him to leave. The former Arsenal striker had actually seen his contract extended by a year to 2022, although Milan, who have been keen on signing him for a while now, have completed a deal for an initial €1 million, with a further €1m due next year. In total, the World Cup winner made 119 appearances for the Blues in all competitions, scoring 39 goals. He won three trophies with his former club, including the FA Cup, Champions League and Europa League. Giroud’s exit to Milan signals the end of his time in England, where he spent the last nine years of his career, having joined Arsenal from Montpellier back in 2012. In a farewell message to Chelsea and their supporters posted on his official Twitter account, Giroud wrote: “To all the Blues, to my teammates, to all my coaches, to the whole club, a huge thank you for these special moments. “I’m starting a new journey with a light and happy heart. Our victories in FA Cup, Europa League and Champions league have been magnificent. Love Oli G.” Goal
