JAMIE Carragher believes the UEFA EURO 2020 Final will go to extra time and penalties, with England beating Italy for the first time on a shoot-out. Both sides had to play 120 minutes in their semi-finals in order to book a spot in this huge game. The Azzurri were pushed all the way to penalties when seeing off Spain after a 1-1 draw, while England got their decisive spot-kick during extra time in a 2-1 victory over Denmark. Considering these are the tightest defences in the entire tournament, England conceding just once and Italy three, Carragher expects another protracted affair. “I think it will be a very tight game,” Carragher told Sky Sports UK. “I think it may go to penalties and England come out victorious. We have done a lot of work on penalties, so let’s not let that go to waste! I don’t think there will be too many goals in the game. “Italy are very strong defensively, so are England. I think it will be 1-1 and then go to penalties.” There can be few doubts that the most impressive sides made it to Wembley for the decider. “I think it’s the right final. I think they have been the two most impressive teams in this competition – and winner takes all on Sunday.” England have never beaten Italy in a major tournament, losing all four attempts, including on penalties in Euro 2012.
