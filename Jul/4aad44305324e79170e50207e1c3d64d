A Federal High Court in Lagos has granted an interim injunction restraining Lekki Gardens Estate Ltd and Foreshore Waters Ltd from constructing, developing, building or any similar activity in Osborne Foreshore Estate II, Ikoyi, Lagos. Justice Nicholas Oweibo gave the order following an application by the registered trustees of Osborne and Foreshore Residents Association through their counsel, Mr Kemi Pinheiro (SAN). The order is the latest episode in a dispute between residents and the association over, among others, an alleged violation of the estate’s building plans. Pinheiro had argued that the defendants’ actions were against the policy of the estate. Residents prayed the court to halt construction on several plots, including Signature One on Royal Palm Drive, Signature Two, Le Chateau, Insignia and Foreshore Towers on Acacia Road within the estate. Justice Oweibo restrained the two defendants/applicants from predicating on any approvals granted by the fourth defendant (Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority), pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. However, the case was adjourned till July 26 as the defendants were absent in court.
